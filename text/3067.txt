Getting Started
Take inventory: What do you have?
What did your predecessor leave? What’s
on your beat?
The basics: Budgets, audits, inspections,
census, demographics, test scores
Ask around: What are you working on?
How do you know that? Can I get a copy?

Taking Inventory
List all the agencies, groups and people
on your beat. Don’t forget small ones.
What do they do? What records do they
keep? What reports do they have to file?
Most agencies either have a master list of
databases or a records retention schedule.
Get it.

The basics, by beat
All beats: Voter registration list, Census
data
Education: Test scores, attendance,
demographics, school district boundary
maps, graduation rates, budgets, audits
Public safety: Arrest and incident logs,
budgets, jail bookings, 911 calls

Government: Budgets; building
permits; parcel maps with zoning,
assessed value; code violations; grant
applications
Community/religion: IRS 990 forms,
state nonprofit statements, Glenmary
religious census, grant applications,
population projections

Sports: Player statistics, rosters, NCAA
reports, gate receipts, budgets
Environment: EPA emissions, water
quality, air quality,
Health: Restaurant inspections, vital
statistics, nursing home inspections
Business: State corporation commission
filings, state labor market data

Expanding your library
Ask around: Talk to people on your beat
about what they’re working on.
Look beyond summaries: Get
underlying data sets for reports.
Bookmarks: Explore state and local Web
sites thoroughly to know what’s
available.

Organizing & storing
Arrange to get routine reports regularly
Figure out a system: Online, on your
desktop or on a server
Keep master copies: Make sure there’s a
copy someplace that nobody can alter
Write it down: Know what you have ...
and what you don’t.

Greatest Data Hits

Energy Stats
Good collection of
information related to
utilities. Find average cost/
KW hr, number of
customers, and other
tantalizing nuglets.

FAA Air
Traffic System
“the official source of historical
air traffic operations for center,
airport, instrument and
approach counts. Daily,
monthly and annual counts
are available either by facility,
state, region, or nationally.
Some ranking tables are also
available.” Nifty export
function, too.

State revenue
dept.
In Missouri, these
guys track
everything from
license plates to sales
tax. And their nerds
are among the most
accessible I’ve come
across.

Local assessor’s
office
Typically has an online
database of property tax
records, detailing house
value, owner, and some
statistics about the house
(Square feet, bedrooms,
bathrooms, year built… on
and on). Don’t forget that the
collector probably has the
“other half” of the data.

Secretary of state
Great resource on local
businesses, nonprofits,
and corporations. Some
states offer better searches
than others. Great way to
find connections between
people and money.

National Center for
Education Statistics
This site has enough odd
searches, tools and tables to
keep you occupied for a
long, long time. All
resources are attributed,
offering even more
opportunities.

State campaign
finance
Helpful for tracking
statewide politicians and
their supporters. Local
reports might be filed here,
or might be at City Hall.

State education
department
Every state has an
education department that
tracks a wealth of
information, including
test scores, ethnic makeups, free and reduced
lunches, discipline
incidents, etc. Most have
an easy-to-find FTP server
for quick downloads.

USGS water
monitoring
These real-time stream
monitors come in handy
during storms to see if
any areas are approaching
flood stage.

State labor/
employment
The keeper of the data
might change state-tostate (Virginia’s
Employment Commission
hosts this site), but it’s
valuable business beat
information wherever you
find it
