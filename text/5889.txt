THE PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY PROJECT

Lynne Perri, Managing Editor

About the Project
Searching across public data sets can be
arduous, particularly on deadline. We built
The Accountability Project so users could
search across otherwise siloed data.

Background
The project was conceived by the late David
Donald, former data editor for The Investigative
Reporting Workshop. The Accountability
Project team — led by Data Editor Jennifer
LaFleur — is working to make his idea a reality
and build it into a robust search site.

Background

So far, we’ve acquired, cleaned and
uploaded hundreds of databases,
accounting for more than
400 million records.

The data
▪ We started with data about money in politics at
the federal and state level because of our
expertise and because it is a necessary backdrop
to any other data.
▪ Unlike data on FEC.gov, the data includes
addresses for campaign donors.

The data
We have added hundreds of other data sets
including:
▪ Data on nonproﬁts
▪ Voter data
▪ State personnel data
▪ Business licenses
▪ Property records

▪ The data focuses on people, organizations and
addresses.
▪ We acquire and clean the data and map it to a set
of key ﬁelds to allow searching across all the data
sets.
