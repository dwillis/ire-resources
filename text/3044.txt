Documents/sources:
• Law enforcement incident reports
• Court records and transcripts
• School district personnel files
• Prosecutors’ criminal case files
• Dispatch survey of other states’ teacher discipline systems
• Administrative hearing transcripts, case summaries and evidence
• State Board of Education meeting minutes between 2000 and 2007
• Ohio Department of Education’s CaseTrax, a database containing the
names of educators reprimanded for misconduct
• ESORN, database of Ohio’s registered sex offenders
• Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction inmate database, which
provides information on nearly one million current and former prisoners
• ODE’s Education Management Information System data from 2000-2006,
which provides school assignment data for nearly 2 million licensed
educators
• Nexis and Teachers and Trash in Education blog (www.
teachertrash.blogspot.com) Both sites helped us find educators singled out in
news articles for wrongdoing but never caught by the Ohio Department of
Education

• MySpace and Facebook. We found both teachers and victims on the social
networking sites.
• Teachers’ contracts. Some had provisions to withhold or remove negative
information from personnel files, gave teachers the right to attend a file
review by members of the public, and lots of other tidbits that essentially
violated the public-record law.
• Legislative service commission. Allowed us to show how state lawmakers
watered down bills to crack down on rogue teachers.
Advice:
• Make your state’s public-record law your best friend. Use it early and often,
and don’t take no for an answer.
• Befriend your attorney general. Ohio’s attorney general is an advocate for
openness who helped pry records from the state Education Department.
• Buy a good set of tires. You’ll be spending a lot of time on the road
collecting records.
• Search every nook and cranny – Google, Nexis, courthouses, police stations
and personnel files – to learn the details of teachers’ misconduct. Those are
the places where we learned some of the most shocking details of teacher
misconduct, such as sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancies that the
state Education Department didn’t share.
• Become an expert on the topic. It allowed us to write with authority, and it
helped calm jittery editor nerves because we could answer every question –
no matter how obscure.
• Learn how other states handle misconduct. Florida and South Carolina both
operate with a lot more sunshine and thoroughness. They allowed us to cite
examples of other states who better serve their public.
• Brace yourself for the threat of lawsuits. Teachers don’t want to see their
names in print and will try to prevent publication. Have plan for how to
handle those inevitable calls. We routed teachers to our attorney at the first
mention of lawsuit.
• Build a Wiki on your newsroom’s intranet. It helped us organize mountains
of paper records, notes and public-records requests on hundreds of teachers.
The Wiki:
A wiki can be really useful to sort through the volumes of stuff you must you
gather during a project. And it’s really simple to build – it’s nothing more than
an internal site that functions like a Web page. Here’s how we used ours:
• To organize documents. For our project, we created a page to track what
teachers’ files we had, then link to a page that listed our favorites – the
ones we thought we might write about.

• To organize thoughts. Early on in the project, we started jotting down
story ideas, then fleshed them out into outlines and then, finally, a
working budget. Instead of storing all those documents as Word files
somewhere, the whole evolution of the project was stored electronically
on the site.
• To track correspondence. We probably made a hundred public-records
requests, and the flow of requests and responses could’ve been truly
overwhelming. But we created a place on the Wiki to write down what
the request was and the date, categorized by the type of agency the
request went to.
• To keep one another informed. There were two of us on this project,
often canvassing opposite corners of the state at the same time. With the
Wiki, we didn’t have to wait until we were back in the newsroom to
convene and compare notes and teachers’ stories – we could just create
a space on the wiki to jot down a few highlights, or even cut-and-paste
bits of evidence or quotes or interviews.
• To make an editing chain. Editing a project can be a long (and
sometimes confusing) process – sometimes there can be a lot of cooks
in the kitchen. And all that, “it’s back to you,” and “it’s ready to read”
stuff can get a bit muddy. So we created a page on the wiki to track
which stories, nuggets, and online pieces were ready to edit. Then, as
the writing moved to a new editor, we were able to note that on the wiki.
We always knew who had read and still had to edit our work.
