1. Figure out as specifically as possible what problem you are trying to identify:
Not: Why can’t people get better mental health treatment?
But: How many people return to the emergency room with a psychiatric crisis each year and
precisely how often? Where did people go after leaving the long-term psych wards?
2. Ask everyone you interview: Who is doing a good job at addressing this problem? Then go
there and have the stakeholders explain how they did it, what the barriers were, how they
overcame them, what the long-term results were.
3. Show me the numbers. Don’t take anyone’s word for it. Look at the tangible results.
Example #1: How Houston created a team of police officers to track what happened to the
people they brought in on emergency detentions. How many ended up being re-detained?

Example #2: Columbus, OH built supportive housing, individual units with some supervision.
What happened to the hospitalization rate?

Example#3: Pittsburgh

4. When is a “solution” not really a solution? Is it based on success elsewhere or is it an optic
to make politicians look like they are really addressing an issue?
Example: Milwaukee police trained all officers in Crisis Intervention Team approach after a man
with mental illness was shot and killed but that was NOT the way the program was designed.
We interviewed the architects of the program, read the academic literature, looked at the
statistics for the places that stayed true to the integrity of the original model.
Sometimes, there is a good story in what is NOT really a solution.
