What is impostor syndrome?
Do you ever tell yourself…
“Why did they hire me?”
“What if someone ﬁnds out I suck?”
Despite other people occasionally saying…
“That was a really good story.”
“Great job on that investigation/code/interview.”

Congratulations!!
You may have impostor syndrome

Many women will not apply for a job unless they have all of the skills listed
One boss told me they used the above approach and only men took them up on this advice.
Women still tried to check all of the boxes.
People with impostor syndrome are REALLY motivated.
They will work hard to prove themselves

If your employee does exceptional work, be sure they know

Silence your inner contrarian
We are data reporters. Be objective.

“Why did they hire me?”

“I suck.”

Silence your inner contrarian

“Why did they hire me?”
Statistically it is unlikely that you conned a smart group of people into hiring a fraud.
They aren’t doing you a favor by hiring you. They hired you to solve a problem and
they think you are the one who can do the job.
“I suck.”
We beat ourselves up worse than any bully ever could, and this kind of criticism is
unfair. Be kind to yourselves.
