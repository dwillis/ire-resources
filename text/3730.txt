TIPSHEET

HealthCare Money --- finding stories in elections that can have local and national focus
Alicia Mundy The Wall Street Journal -- June 16, 2012 Salon C

Despite uncertainty over how the Supreme Court decision on the health care bill will affect some
sectors, healthcare professionals and their PACS are on track to match – perhaps to surpass –
the more than $ 100 million donated in the 2008 elections.
Some of their concerns are driven by desires to overturn the ACA, or at least parts of it such as
IPAB -- and there are growing worries about decreasing Medicare payments and increasing
CMS cuts.
GENERALLY: Health insurance companies, pharma corporations, supplement makers are
players, and there are some shifts in their giving patterns this election, compared to 2008 and
2010. OpenSecrets.org and other sites have breakdowns by party.

Two other categories, with potential local examples, stand out as potential story groups – and
ways to find stories that save you from doing the large, omnibus ―How much is the health care
industry spending in this election‖ story that becomes stale and common pretty quickly – and
these examples won’t take more than a couple weeks maximum.

1) Doctor-Owned Hospitals – about 35 states have them – . Theyfiercely fighting the ACA
which targeted them for extinction by stopping all new physician owned hospitals or their
additions as of the end of 2010 – they involve a number of affiliated groups – Spine and
Joint Hospitals, Orthopedic Surgery hospitals -- The American Hospital Directory
http://www.ahd.com/ can help you find names of such hospitals and see simple stats on
their revenues, comparisons, etc. as can the Physician Hospital site –
http://www.physicianhospitals.org/
Doctor Owned hospitals – one in McAllen Texas -- were the focus of the famous Atul
Gawande piece in the New Yorker in 2009 that became the poster children showing the need
for health care reform and cost cutting –
The concept is that there is likely one in your backyard or your state – it’s not hard to find
their state political contributions, national, their lobbying expenses, their individual sites
showing their amenities, the groups newsletters describing what they want from government,
and a local doctor or hospital co=owner who wants to talk about what they want and what the
national group is going to do for them. The national groups have ―Lobby Day‖ in Washington,
which they usually write about in newsletter s and might give you specific names of individuals
1

3730
who came to DC to lobby against the ACA or Medicare cuts, and who is from your state or
locality –
They have high profit margins and are surprisingly active in politics—

2)

Medical Professional Groups -- There are also dozens of PACS related to specific
healthcare professional groups , many of them relatively new, that tell a story of
internecine warfare, courage, honor, gender politics in medicine and the power of
monopolies.

Three focuses --- ―workforce issues‖ -- protect turf from competition; promote Medicare and
insurance coverage of procedures that might not otherwise be covered; stop cuts in
government payment e.g. the ―Doc Fix‖
Some of these groups’ efforts lend themselves to local and state stories as well as the
conventional Washington-based tales.
There are PACS for pediatricians, podiatrists, orthopedists, optometrists, dental hygienists,
radiologists, urologists -– cosmetic surgeons (PLASTYPAC)
--- and most hometowns have doctors who belong to their local medical specialty societies –
The state organizations collect dues, lobby and donate to candidates – and are part of national
groups that do the same -Lobbying expenses can be tracked at federal level on SOPR, Open Secrets and elsewhere –
and Follow the Money has information in some states that at least identifies lobbying action, if
not the size of the expense
MOST of them have ―Lobby Day‖ in Washington as well as in statehouses –
(tip: supplement makers have Natural Products Association Day)
Most groups have newsletters that are sometimes quite candid about their issues and what they
want from the government .
Some newsletters talk very candidly about Lobby Day, number of visitors, who their go-to guys
in Congress are and what they want –
Other ways to identify their go to guys in Congress is to see who introduces their bills or holds
hearings related to their group’s issues (federal http://thomas.loc.gov/home/thomas.php
State – see Follow the Money below)
Other ways to tell the story about them: PARTY TIME Sunlight Foundation
http://politicalpartytime.org/ talks about fundraisers and sometimes has names
2

3730
To gauge a group’s strength – use Follow the Money at state levels and look for contributions to
Governors’ races, as well as federal Pac strength – state donations may be larger than those at
federal level and that becomes interesting
The ACA , Thomas, and Follow the Money’s LCAT site are among sources for legislation
tracking that lead back to many of these groups
Open Secrets breaks down groups and their sector by party at the federal level – Follow the
Money does much of this by state –
The Federal Trade Commission -- for actions at state levels involving healthcare industry
sectors/boards—hospital mergers

One example of a surprisingly assertive medical group:
Podiatry -- wasn’t in minimum core coverage in the ACA bill, and podiatrists are annoyed

Here’s a clip from one of their newsletters

Medicaid, Medical Liability Reform at Forefront of 27th Annual
Podiatric Medical Legislative Conference
Washington, DC—From March 19–21, several hundred state and national leaders in podiatric
medicine will meet with key legislators in the nation’s capital to discuss Medicaid, medical liability

reform, and other priority health-care concerns at the 27th Annual Podiatric Medical Legislative
Conference.
Hosted by the American Podiatric Medical Association (APMA), the Podiatric Medical Legislative
Conference will be held at the JW Marriott in Washington, DC, and welcome several notable guest
speakers: US Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), as well as US Representatives Steve King (R-IA), and
Jason Altmire (D-PA).
―The Podiatric Legislative Conference helps today’s podiatrists to build and maintain integral
relationships, and to introduce members of Congress to the profession of podiatric medicine,‖ said
Joseph Caporusso, DPM, president of APMA. ―We look forward to educating our country’s leaders about
a podiatrist’s education, their key role in delivering needed health care, and the issues faced by the
profession that only legislators can resolve.‖
Government and private sector experts will also share how important policy matters affect health-care
delivery in 2012. Among the key issues APMA podiatrists will highlight with senators and
representatives are: Medicaid beneficiary access to podiatric physicians (HR 3364/S 1309);
permanent SGR/physician payment reform; IPAB repeal; preserving provider non-discrimination
protections in the Affordable Care Act; and medical liability reform.
The current primary focus of APMA’s advocacy efforts is the passage of legislation to affirm the role of
podiatrists as physicians within all federal legislation.
For more information on the 27th Annual Podiatric Medical Legislative Conference, contact Peter Stein
at pjstein@apma.org.
