Obligatory Data Mining Pun

Why Use Scorecard?
• Lots of never-before-released data on colleges

• Are students repaying their debt, earning a living wage, or graduating?
• Can localize to your state or community
• Many variables are in the raw data files and not on the website look-up!

ADMISSIONS CRITERIA

DEGREES AWARDED

COST & NET PRICE

GRAD RATES

DEFAULT RATES

LOAN REPAYMENT RATES

STUDENT DEMOGRAPHICS

DEBT LOADS

POST-COLLEGE EARNINGS

... AND MORE!

Getting the Data
• Look up a school at https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/
• For the full download:
https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/
• Warnings about the raw data:
– These files are huge (212 mb).
– They’re too wide to go into SQL server.
– ~20 years of data, ~2000 variables, ~7000 schools.

Data Download

Before Using the Data
• The Department of Education has included some
excellent resources to help understand what's in
the data and how to best use it. It's important to
take a look at this before you start working with
the data. Find everything on the Scorecard site:

https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/

Readings
• Read the policy paper: Why the Department created the
Scorecard and what's new in the data. The paper provides
critical context on the Scorecard data and was created for

the general public, policymakers and the non-technically
savvy.

• Read the technical paper: The properties and the
limitations of the data. The paper explains the different
sources of the data as well as how to best analyze it.

Technical Documentation
• Review the data documentation: Explains
the structure of the data, types/classes of
variables, and how to use the API.
• Review the data dictionary: Variable names,

labels, sources, API data types and the
categories of the data.

Data Dictionary

Cohort Map

General Warnings
• Each record is the year of data, an individual school,
and about 2000 variables.

• Some of the fields (i.e. earnings) are JUST for students
who get federal aid. Read the documentation.

• Some data is based on when students ENTER college
(earnings) and other is based on when they EXIT. Read
the data documentation.

OPEID vs. UNITID
• The DOE has two types of IDs. It’s crazy. That also
means THERE ARE DUPLICATES.

• UNITID:
– For every CAMPUS. How
colleges report grad rates,
enrollment to IPEDS
– Each record in the data is

for a UNITID.

• OPEID:
– For every SCHOOL. How
the government reports

federal aid
– A campus may have
several UNITIDS and ONE
OPEID in the data.

In Other Words

• SELECT DISTINCT ON THE “OPIED6” FIELD

Getting into a Database: Option 1
• At WSJ, we wrote a python script to cut the
data in half and separate into two relational

tables. Each table has the year of the data,
and ID numbers affiliated with the school.
• Each file is a different year and we combined
them into the same database.

Python!

SQL!

Getting into a Database: Option 2
• At ProPublica, we downloaded the raw data and
created an R script that enables the user to cut
the data based on desired year(s) and variables.

The script also enabled us to add other IPEDS
variables that were not part of Scorecard. We

analyzed cut and analyzed the data in R, and
then exported a file for our news app.

Grad Rates

Pell Grad Rates

Grad Rates (cont.)

Accreditation & Grad Rates

Low Grad Rates & Accreditation

Grad Rates: Need-to-Know
• Variable names: C150_4, C150_L4, C150_4_POOLED

• Original source: IPEDs
• Definition: Measures “150% of normal time” – aka 6

years for a 4 year program.
• Breaking it down: Race and non-resident alien.

Grad Rates: Caveats
– DO NOT USE grad rates from NSLDS ( e.g.
COMP_ORIG_YR2_RT).
– Only for first-time, full-time students who begin school in
the fall semester. Variables do not include part-

time/transfer/non-fall starting students (which represent
50% of college students).

Student Loan Payback

Repayment Rates

Lagging Repayment

Repayment Rates (cont.)

Repayment Rates: Need-to-Know
• Variable names: RPY_1YR_RT, RPY_3YR_RT, etc.

• Definition: students who have not defaulted and have
paid down at least $1 in the principal balance on their
loans since leaving school. Includes graduates and dropouts and excludes in-school/military deferments.
• Time periods: 1, 3, 5 and 7 years after leaving school.

Repayment Rates: Need to Know
(cont.)
• Note about cohort time period: if the data is for 2011, that includes
students who started paying from October 1,2010-September 20,
2011.
• Breaking it down: Family income, gender, Pell Grant recipients,

completion status, first generation and dependence status.
• Note about use: Better than default rate because default rate can
be manipulated.

Default Rates

Default Rates

Default vs. Repayment

Default Rates: Need-to-Know
• CDR2, CDR3
• Measured in for three years out of school,
formally 2 years

• Repayment rate is better data, but schools
are judged on their default rates.

Post-College Earnings

Earnings Track SAT … Except at
Liberal Arts Schools

High Test Scores, Low Earnings

Earning More Than a High School Grad?

Earnings: Need-to-Know
• Variable names: MD_EARN_WNE_P10, MD_EARN_WNE_P6,
gt_25k_p6, gt_25k_p10, etc.
• Definition: the mean/median of student earnings after entry into
school. Includes graduates, drop-outs and excludes graduate
students.
• Time periods available: For 6-10 years after entry.
• Shape of the data: 10th, 25th, 70th, and 90th percentiles

• Breaking it down: Gender, family income, independent and
dependent students
• Most recent data: Latest is measured in 2011 and 2012.

Earnings: Caveats
• Program-level earnings data is not yet available. Research
suggests variation across programs within a school may be
even greater than aggregate earnings across schools.
• Data includes only Title IV-receiving students, so it may not
be representative of schools with a low number of Title-IV

students (i.e. Only 3% of Harvard students take on federal
loans and 10% of their students receive Pell grants).

Student Loan Debt

Rich Schools, High Debt

Debt by Degrees

Soaring Debts

Low Incomes, High Debt

Debt: Need-to-Know
• Variable names: DEBT_MDN,
GRAD_DEBT_MDN, LO_INC_DEBT_MDN, etc.

• Definition: Median cumulative debt upon leaving
school. Includes grads and drop outs.

• Breaking it down: Family income band,
completers, Pell recipients, first generation,

dependent status.

Debt: Caveats
– Only includes Title IV loans—no private loans

are included.
– There are some schools where a lot of

students drop out and the debt levels will be
reflective of that (i.e. it could be lower).
– At schools where few students borrow, the
figure may represent outliers.

Importance of Cohorts
• Make apples-to-apples comparisons.
– If you are analyzing any of the Scorecard figures,
make sure you're not comparing 2-year school
figures to 4-year school figures. Use PREDDEG
variable (predominant degree) or IPEDS variable
for number of years.

Importance of Cohorts (cont.)
– Additionally, break down data into cohorts to compare:

• Public, Private nonprofit, Private for-profit (CONTROL).
• States (ST_FIPS)
• Carnegie Classifications (CCBASIC)
• HBCUS, Tribal Schools, Hispanic Serving institutions, etc.. (HBCU,
TRIBAL, HSI)
• Highly selective schools vs. Not highly selective schools (ADM_RATE)
• Research universities vs. Small liberal arts schools.
• Size of school (UGDS)
• Endowment of school (data source: NACUBO).

Reporting Recipe
Originally created for college students to help them report
on student debt at their own colleges, this recipe is a great
tool for localizing student debt
