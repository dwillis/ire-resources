Tips:

Read tribal constitutions, laws, bylaws etc. Do they have an open records
policy? Does it apply only to tribal members? If so, can you find a tribal
member to ask for records for you?
If the tribe’s council and committee meetings are open, attend some of
them to develop sources and trust. If they’re closed to all but tribal
members, check the tribe’s website for minutes.
FOIA the BIA. Examine things, especially money, the agency is supposed to
be overseeing on behalf of tribes.
There are more than 80 federal agencies that touch tribal issues in some
way. Depending on your issue -- housing, education, substance abuse or
even the environment -- there’s probably a federal agency involved with the
tribe. The BIA oversees oil and gas production on tribal land and should be
able to tell you what other agencies have oversight of the issue you’re
investigating.
Tribal courts: Can you get access to dockets and/or hearings? Ask the court
for permission.
Attend tribal council meetings, village meetings, form relationships, stay
informed. Often times this will lead you to other sources to gather
information, reveal new story ideas
