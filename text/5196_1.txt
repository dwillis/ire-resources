Covering the military is tricky. Although it’s a hierarchical bureaucracy, the pathway to a
good source or even an official spokesperson often will prove painful.
This is especially true when you’re on deadline.
In 2013 at IRE in San Antonio I printed out hundreds of copies of a primer I thought
would be catnip to fellow reporters. It boasted an exhaustive Rolodex of public affairs
officers, think tanks and defense contractors.
And you hated it! You really hated it!
So I’m not going to make that mistake again. I understand that you really want the
names and numbers of interesting people who are 1) competent; 2) return calls; and 3)
actually will help you.
I’ve divided these into categories and will explain why I think you might consider them
when working on a military story.
Starting at the top …
Let’s say you really don’t know where to start looking for information about a subject.
Or you need an official statement about something you’re scribbling. These are
probably the places where you could start your trip, but they likely won’t be where it
ends.
The good news is that if you started off at the wrong spot they’ll usually direct you to the
right command.

Story Ideas
Yeah, that’s why you’re really here.
Because I’ve done so much reporting over the years on national security issues, I’ve
encountered pretty much all the uniformed services, plus the U.S. Department of
Veterans Affairs, the Department of Homeland Security and no small number of state
agencies. Nothing surprises me now!
I’m not putting these stories down as an ersatz brag sheet but rather including them
because I can blueprint how I did them and that might help you figure your articles out,
too.
1. Rules of Engagement (2012). It won an IRE Award! Al Tompkins at Poynter
pretty much limned the basics of it in 2013, but I probably should mention how
hard the FOIA part of the story became. Fort Bragg officials never fulfilled even
one FOIA request. Not one. When I tried to get the CID report from the Army
after the investigation was officially closed, officers lied to me and said it didn’t
even exist. The only reason why I was able to get the report was because I
already had been linked large sections of it and told the military that if they didn’t
fork it over I was going to put everything I had online, without redactions to
protect classified information or confidential Army sources. That shook it loose.
But in the end I relied far more on the leaked material. If you can’t cultivate trust
with whistleblowers or your news outlet won’t go to court to finagle documents
that should be available under FOIA, probing the armed forces will be difficult.
2. I’ve written a lot of stories about the VA. I predicted that the cascade of initial
claims for disability pensions would become a flood of appeals, a problem still
dogging the agency. And I figured out how to track medical records privacy
violations to show how the VA system is probably the worst hospital network
nationwide at protecting sensitive data. For the former, I used the online
appellate court docket to build (unfortunately largely by hand) a database to track
thousands of veterans’ deaths as their cases languished in the system. For the
latter, I built a mammoth database with tens of thousands of fields to analyze the
sheer magnitude of the problem – and to find interesting voices for my story.
3. For Wounded Warriors, a series of stories about the horrible care wounded
soldiers received after returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, I was leaked reams
of inspection reports on Warrior Transition Units nationwide. They were an
unflinching examination of how the military had failed its most vulnerable troops,
warehousing them in barracks that made the Walter Reed campus look like
Disneyworld. I was able to break it by cultivating sources inside the Pentagon's
Office of Wounded Warrior Care and Transition Policy. It should be mention that
the documents I obtained by FOIA from the agency were redacted in such a way
as to appear the exact opposite of what they were saying. It’s why I relied on
secret records the armed forces didn’t want me to see. Leakers are your friends.

4. This is a story I turned in days. I’d been tipped off that the nonprofit that ran San
Diego’s Fleet Week was flat broke and the annual celebration for the Navy and
Marine Corps was in jeopardy. I used 990s and California’s charity filings to
construct just how badly the organization was doing and then started asking hard
questions about what drove it into the ground. There was nothing nefarious about
Fleet Week, but if you start sniffing around the charities that claim to help the
armed forces and veterans, you’ll find some shady nonprofits.
5. If you ever want to break the internet, write about a SEAL who moonlights as a
porn star !!!
