Percentage change
Use percentage change to compare change over time, basically trends. It is
frequently wrong because many journalists divide the difference between old and new
into the new number instead of the old. The formula is:
Old Population: 834,000

New Population: 989,000

((New – Old) / Old) * 100

((989,000 – 834,000) / 834,000) * 100 = 18.6 %

Base changes
What if the population decreases instead of increases? The formula is the same,
but the result will be different because the base is different.
Old Population: 989,000

New Population: 834,000

((New – Old) / Old) * 100

((834,000– 989,000) / 989,000) * 100 = - 15.7 %

Rates
Rates allow you to compare apples and apples. Perhaps the most common rate is
per capita, which takes populations differences into account. Because readers have
trouble with decimals, you often must multiple the value by a constant to get a whole
number. The result is a rate based on population per unit. Here’s the formula:
Homicides in Dallas: 226
Population of Dallas: 1,230.302

Homicides in Fort Worth: 57
Population of Fort Worth: 576, 57

(Event/Population) * Constant “Per” Unit
Dallas:
(226 / 1,230,302) * 100,000 = 18.4 per 100,000
Fort Worth: (57 / 576,399) * 100,000 = 9.9 per 100,000

Newsroom Stats
Often, you want to describe what it typical of the data. Here are three statistics
that can help you.
Mode: The most frequently occurring value. It is the best measure of what is typical
when the data is in categories but not numbers, such as the most popular dog breed.
Mean: The mean is the average. It is the best measure of what is typical when the data
are distributed normally – in other words, when you don’t have extreme values, like a
bunch of homes worth around $250,000 each and one $2.5 million mansion.
Median: It is the middle value. Extreme values have minimal effect on the median
because they do not move it much. If the data are distributed normally, the average and
the median are the same. Thus, the larger the difference between them, the larger the
skew and the more reason to use the median.
Let’s use baseball data during the 1994-1995 strike and decide which measure to report:
Mode: $100,000

Mean: $1.2 million

Median: $350,000

The mode is the minimum salary because the most players make it, but it a poor
measure of what is typical. The mean is much larger than the median, so the data are not
normally distributed – think about the few hot-shot players paid several million who
will bring up the average. Consequently, the median is the best choice.

Weighted average
Do not average averages. They are usually based on groups of different sizes. To
remedy the situation, multiply each average by the number in that group. Add up the
values for the groups, and then divide by the total number in all groups. Let’s calculate
the average salary in a school district.
Teacher average: $37,000 (10,000 teachers)
Janitor average: $20,000 (2,000 janitors)
Principal average: $75,000 (500 principals)
Teachers: $37,000 * 10,000 = $370,000,000
Janitors:
$20,000 * 2,000 = $40,000,000
Principals: $75,000 * 500 = $37,500,000
_______ ___________
12,500 $447,000,000
District average: $447,000,000 / 12,500 = $35,800

Sampling error
Any poll that is not based on the entire population will contain error. Why? The
poll was based on only a sample of the population, and samples can vary. Fortunately, the
sampling error can be calculated. Basically, the larger the sample, the smaller the error.
However, at some point increasing the sample will only give you a slightly smaller
sampling error, so it is not cost effective. To calculate sampling error, divide 1 by the
square root of the sample size: Here is the formula:
Sampling error= 1 / √N
Let’s calculate the sampling error for three samples:
N = 100 / √100 = ± 10 points
N = 400 / √100 = ± 5 points
N = 900 / √100 = ± 3.3 points
As you can see, increasing the sample is starting have less effect on the sampling
error. Please note that the sampling error is plus or minus. Thus, with a sampling error of
± 5 points the candidate must be ahead by more than 10 points to have to really be
leading. If it is less, you cannot tell who is leading. Here are some other points to
remember about poll results:
•
•
•

Don’t report unscientific polls. Their results are meaningless.
Beware of big error margins on subgroups. They’re based on smaller samples.
Don’t forget that a poll at best is a snapshot of now, not a predictor of the future.

Numbers v. words
Readers have difficulty with numbers, especially large or small ones. Stick to the
most important numbers, and use them to back up your main points. Sprinkle them
throughout the story, and use smaller numbers whenever possible to make them easier for
readers to understand. Let charts and other graphics show most of the numbers.
Remember, the story is about how it affects people. Follow these tips as well:

•

No more than two or three numbers in a paragraph.
Round off – and round off some more.
Avoid false precision, like saying, “about 35.7 percent of those surveyed…”
Learn to convert to simple ratios to keep the numbers small.
Relate the numbers to what is relevant in people’s lives, such as how much more
the typical reader would pay when taxes are increased.
Memorize common numbers on your beat and note when they change.
Always double-check your math. Windows comes with a calculator so use it.
Better yet, use a spreadsheet.
