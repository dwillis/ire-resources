NICAR 2014: Intro to Google Earth
Engine | http://bit.ly/nicarearth
Google Earth Engine brings together the world's satellite imagery
— trillions of scientific measurements dating back almost 40 years
— and makes it available online with tools for scientists,
independent researchers, and nations to mine this massive
warehouse of data to detect changes, map trends and quantify
differences on the Earth's surface. Learn more about Google Earth
Engine and visit this getting started tutorial.

Timelapse:
Working with the USGS, NASA, and TIME magazine, Google
released more than a quarter-century of images of Earth taken
from space, compiled for the first time into an interactive timelapse experience. View stunning phenomena such as the
sprouting of Dubai’s artificial Palm Islands, the retreat of Alaska’s
Columbia Glacier, the deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon and
urban growth in Las Vegas from 1984 to 2012.
