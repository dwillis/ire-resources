PREPARATION IS EVERYTHING
•
•
•

Know your documents & evidence: Compiling databases/spreadsheets will also help you remember key points.
Know it better than they do: What does the person you are holding accountable know? Knowing it better than they do
will help you stay in control of the interview. Your confidence will show.
Bring the Goods: When preparing, think about what documents and undercover material you can bring to the interview.
Having tangible evidence creates moments.
Role play: Anticipate the response. Prepare for different reactions. How will your interviewee explain, deny, dodge,
manipulate perception, distract, downplay, or be a magician?
Focus: No matter how many questions you jot down, highlight the three main points/answers you want to walk away
with. Focus on the key points.

THE MAIN EVENT

Minimize interaction: Wait outside while your photographer sets up. If you’re in the room, talk about anything but the
interview topic. Even for non-confrontational interviews, you don’t want to waste good soundbites.
Organize: Have your documents and videos in order of the questions you’ll ask. Bring additional examples.
Make it simple for yourself: If you have multiple interviews back to back, use a “top sheet” for each person. Key
numbers, points, examples applicable to that interviewee to jog your memory and avoid paper shuffling.
Be aware of your tone- and his or hers: You never know how someone is going to react in an interview until that
moment. Is he/she being sarcastic? Angry? Upfront? Falling on the sword? Know when to back down and when to rev up
in the aggressiveness of your questions. You never want to seem like a bully.
Keep Calm: Combative interviews are inevitable. You can be aggressive without losing control.
Don’t throw a curve ball on the first pitch: Start by asking 1 or 2 broader questions. See how they react. Their body
language and/or response may give you a sense of how they will play it.
PR move: Sometimes your interviewee will be coached with PR points. No matter what you ask, they have one line and
are sticking to it. Just keep asking the question in different ways. Boil it down to a final “This is a yes or no question.”
Listen: The best questions can be the ones you never plan to ask. They are the follow-ups. Be flexible in the interview.
Be direct: Don’t beat around the bush. Ask short questions.
Remember your question: The most powerful answers often include your question. They can show how someone is
dodging what you’re asking.
Don’t be afraid of silence: Control the interview. An awkward silence can tell a lot. It can force your subject to answer
the question. Most people feel uncomfortable during silence.

THE UNSCHEDULED INTERVIEW

Make it a last resort: Make every attempt to reach the subject for a comment. Allow for a reasonable period of time.
Plan for a public place: Always plan to conduct your unscheduled interviews in public places. Try for a parking lot or
public building where access is permitted.
Plan, plan and plan: Detailed planning is essential. If it’s a parking lot, where are the best angles? What if the subject
suddenly leaves? Scout out all entrances and exits.
Rehearse: These situations are similar to scheduled interviews. Anticipate answers. Go through a list of possible
scenarios and prepare for a series of follow-ups.
Be respectful: The approach should be respectful with the expectation that you may get to ask only one question. That
should be the most important question. Make sure to introduce yourself and tell the subject where you are from to avoid
any confusion.
Remember the object of the interview: You are doing the unscheduled interview to get answers. If the subject stops and
starts offering answers, be prepared to conduct a full interview. This may be the only opportunity.
Follow the action: Avoid snap zooms and sudden camera movements. Don’t stop shooting.
Be flexible: Sometimes an unscheduled interview will lead to the sit down interview you wanted in the first place. If that
happens, don’t put any conditions on the interview.

FOLLOW UP
•
•
•

Take it to someone else: Official says what he/she did was fine, denies it, and/or avoids the question. Have an ethicist,
expert, or another official give their opinion.
Don’t get the interview: Push harder. Still don’t get it? Story isn’t dead. Explain the process-example- “We called Joe
Smith 12 times and went to his house but he refused to answer our questions.”
Request emails from public employees & officials: Once the story airs, request emails relating to it. Use key words
including your name, producer name, and the station. See what they say about the subject matter and the story.
