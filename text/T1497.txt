Using Business Information Online Resources in Researching Enron
Presentation for the NICAR Conference, Philadelphia, March 15, 2002
Richard Drezen, Research Librarian, The Washington Post, drezenr@washpost.com

Main points:
(1) Online sources for Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) filings and bankruptcy court documents were
very important in the Enron research.
(2) Using a mix of fee-based and free online business research sources, with emphasis on the former, achieved the
best results.
(3) Cited below are a few useful tips based on our experience at The Washington Post.
(4) A complete list of online sources mentioned in the presentation is provided below in two categories, “feebased” or “free.”

TIP #1
A good starting point in doing any kind of company research, here using Enron as the example, is to check to see if
the company you are interested in has an official web site. A public company like Enron is likely to have much more
information on their web site than a private company. Enron’s web site at www.enron.com proved helpful from the
start. Its searchable collection of press releases archived by year was essential in confirming employee names and
finding data on the partnerships.
TIP#2
Wading through SEC filings can be difficult if one doesn’t know exactly what to look for.
Start with the latest 10-K annual filing for the company in question and focus on the “List of Exhibits,” which is
basically a table of contents itemizing materials referenced on the 10-K and the company’s other documents. This
strategy proved invaluable in trying to find Enron documents that were attached to or referenced on the 10-K’s.
TIP#3
Looking for a basic thumbnail description on a company? Try Company Dossier on Nexis. Enter the name of the
company or it’s ticker, if public. It will bring up a report consisting of directory-like information, recent news,
business, financial and legal analysis as well as an “intellectual property” section that looks at some of the
company’s patents and trademarks. Company Dossier offered a good overview of Enron and its various lines of
business.
TIP#4
Many bankruptcy courts publish calendars of upcoming activity pertaining to the larger cases.
For Enron, go into http://www.nysb.uscourts.gov and look at the top of the homepage for the
Enron hyperlink. Click on it to bring up the Enron Corp. Calendar which lists courtroom events scheduled into the
autumn of this year.
TIP#5
Don’t’ overlook online database customer support. Occasionally questions arise that only the vendor can answer by
e-mailing them or calling their 800 number. This was especially true looking for Enron historical data on
Bloomberg, requiring extensive search assistance.
