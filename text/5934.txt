Anecdotes and
Characters
How to ﬁnd them, making them great, and
knowing when to walk away
By Lauren Etter

Why an Anecdote?
According to Merriam-Webster, the word anecdote typically
means a “short narrative of an interesting, amusing, or
biographical incident.”

● Like this one: Empress Theodora, the wife of
the Roman emperor Justinian “in the middle of
the winter, put the man aboard ship and sent
him away to a destination which the Empress
had selected, and she caused his head to be
shaved and compelled him quite against his
will to be a priest. Justinian himself meanwhile
gave the impression that he knew nothing of
what was going on.”
● This comes from the title of a scholarly work by
Procopius, a Byzantine Greek scholar who
wrote the History of the Wars. He also wrote a
“secret” then unpublished history that
contained “bitter attacks on the emperor
Justinian, his wife and other notables of
contemporary Constantinople.”
● The title of the book: “Anecdota”, which came
from the Greek word “ekdidonai” that literally
translated into “not to publish”.

So in other words:
Anecdotes are the good
stuﬀ!
The stuﬀ that we as journalists are drawn to, and the stuﬀ that
readers adore. They are the leavening of any story, and are
particularly useful in business stories, which have an undeserved
reputation as being boring or staid.

the prism through
which we tell

Qualities of a
good anecdote
or lead
character
1. Uniqueness
2. Proximity
3. A keeper of a
story

●Preferably this person or event has
never been written about before. It’s
no fun telling old stories.
●Preferably this person has close
access to an event and can provide
colorful and detailed descriptions.
●Preferably this person has a story to
tell. I enjoy writing about ordinary
people doing extraordinary things.

Some
anecdotes fall
into your lap
But you might not know it at the
time
Write down even the mundane
details so you can follow up on them
later.
“Pony in cafeteria”
“Pony gone”

Recognizing a
great anecdote
Recognize special characters and
anecdotes
Be open to giving your anecdotes
more space if they deserve it
Don’t try to shoehorn characters
into a story
Maybe they are their own story

Your anecdote
can live
anywhere –
hunt for it
Anecdotes arise in strange places
I was so struck by this photo I found on
Google images that I spent weeks
ﬁnding the story behind it
It ended up in the lead of my story. “As
refugees endured freezing
temperatures and tensions with
Macedonian border guards, Western
Union set up a counter under the
terra-cotta roof of a former butcher
shop near Idomeni’s railway station.”

Mine archives
for great
anecdotes
I almost always look at old newspaper clippings or
other archives for stories, even those that wouldn’t
have an obvious historical slant to them
“The Bermúdez family got into the bourbon
business, forming a partnership with Mary Dowling,
proprietor of Waterﬁll & Frazier, one of Kentucky’s
leading bourbon distillers. Dowling wasn’t the sort
of woman to shut down because the government
passed a law. According to archives at the
University of Kentucky Libraries, she stuﬀed
thousands of bottles of bourbon into gunnysacks
and hid them in the basement of her white manor
house in Lawrenceburg. Then she hired family
friends to help her dismantle her distillery piece by
piece, load it on a rail car, and ship it to Ciudad
Juárez.

Don’t be afraid
to cut ties with
your lead
anecdote
Just as important as identifying your
lead anecdote is knowing when to
part with it
Be prepared to walk away; don’t get
too attached
Your story will survive
And you’ll be able to sleep at night
