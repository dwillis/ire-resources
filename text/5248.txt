Investigations With Impact
By Jay Root
Investigative Reporter
Texas Tribune

Rules of the Road
• Understand the politics/optics of your subject
• The order in which you do things is key
• Know the material before you start calling
• The enemy of my enemy is my friend
• Lobbyists and reporters: a natural marriage
• Never call the flaks first
• Ask for interviews before you ask for info
• Leverage your info to get more info
• Show harm: if no one gets hurt no one cares
• You’re nothing w/out your sources: Treat em well

P2P = Paid To Prosecute
• Get tip while working on workers’ comp
• Seems kinda crazy and not credible: best kind
• Contract between private insurer & govt
• Impact: Most liberal county in Texas
• High probability of sparking outrage
• Teamed up w/AAS: locals can’t ignore
• Helped me get 3 on record interviews
• Save best questions for last

OMG: THIS CONTRACT IS NUTS
• Story begins with a tip from a source
cultivated during workers’ comp stories

Five Days Later . . .

Three Weeks Later . . .

Four Months Later . . .

Two years later . . .

TABC = TX Alcoholic Beverage
Commission
• Starts with my interest in liquor regulation
• Politics/Optics are good: leaders say they don’t
like regs so hypocrisy factor is sky high
• Lots of political $$ from alcohol interests
• I reach out to lobbyist friend w/liquor clients
• Discover they have > 100k emails from TABC
• They’ve done my work for me
• Start to hear it’s more agency than #txlege story
• Then I see the flier: love at first sight

OMG: THIS FLIER IS NUTS

What I did next …
• Found internal emails about the flier
• Showed that top leaders oversaw creation
• Done on state time with state computers
• But what is NCSLA? And why taxpayer $$?
• Trips to Hawaii, San Diego, Florida, etc.
• Get cell phone numbers of key players
• Respect the proper order of things
• Decided to call the guy who made the flier

I call flier creator, flak returns call

What happened next . . .
• Flak dumps it all on the low level guy
• Says he will be “reprimanded” by superiors
• Says he used TABC computer but not during
work hours
• These are all lies
• I call back a day later w/email proof of lies
• This puts pressure on flak/incentive to deal
• Leverage opp: I want interview with director
