No process utilizing lawyers or legal processes exists to be used once or
twice. If some outcome with a serious impact on someone’s life is
prescribed by law, and you’re told it’s a unique circumstance or close to
it, don’t buy it.
Have the outsider’s perspective. Don’t think any institution or process is
harmless merely because it’s been around for a long time and hasn’t
been investigated before. Trust your instincts.
Be fully versed on the “rules” of the system you’re looking into before
you begin the guts of database or people reporting. The story may well
center on the fact that there are no rules. It helps you put in perspective
what you find later and will help you shape drafts much faster.

Don’t just follow the money; know who is making it, and how.

Marshal more forces at the point you can show internally that the bigger
story is there to be had. Find people with complementary skills. Be
honest with yourself about the strength and weaknesses of your own
people.

Video
Video, video
video, video! Only rarely can words portray a victim in full
dimension. Better yet, catch the wrongdoing in the act.
