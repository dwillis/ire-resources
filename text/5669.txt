What’s the secret sauce? The philosophy
● A Reveal story “reveals” something we don’t know, or is
hidden from us
● Reporters take us to a place, we are immersed in the
narrative
● Stories that grab the audience have plot, they surprize
us, they challenge listeners and characters

CBC Podcasts - SKS & Uncover
● Heart and Soul - story with a beating heart
● Guiding North Star - question you are trying to answer
● Characters who are the backbone

Think Serial...what made it
compelling? The chase!

Uncover: The Village

The New Yorker
The Village is as much a gesture toward healing as it is a
work of investigation; its focus is on the victims, their loved
ones, the police, and the community.
What’s being uncovered isn’t a culprit but a history.
More than a whodunit, the series feels like a kind of
truth-and-reconciliation commission, in podcast form.
