We all know that people make the story, but how can you dig up information on them? In this
tipsheet we’ll offer some techniques and resources we’ve used to find people, verify their
information and uncover their online presence.
A disclaimer:
• What you find online isn’t always correct.
• Treat every website just like you would a human source.
• Don’t forget that sometimes the best resources aren’t online.

Getting started
Take a look at “WHO IS JOHN DOE – and where to get the paper on him” from Duff Wilson and
the Reporter’s Desktop. This backgrounding guide can help you think about where you can dig
for just about every facet of a person’s life.

Searching for names
Start with Google, yes Google. But be smart about it:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Use quotation marks
Think of different spellings
Think of different ways names are listed
Test it on yourself
Look at all results including videos and images
Use Advanced Search to narrow down
Search by image

Here are some examples of different ways a name could be found. If you don’t know the middle
name/initial, don’t guess:
Jane Doe

“Jane Doe”
“Jane M Doe”
“Jane Marie Doe”
“Doe, Jane”
“Doe, Jane M”

strengths and weaknesses. Here are some other ones you can try:

Finding people sources

Court records often lead you to family members
Whitepages.com will tell you who else lives in the house and sometimes neighbors
Look for marriage and divorce records; exes sometimes have a lot to say
Social media is a gold mine, especially Facebook for family members and Linkedin for
coworkers
Once you talk to one person, ask them who else you should talk to

Story ideas
 Who owns downtown? or an up-and-coming area of the city?
 Find a cold case -- missing person, homicide, whatever -- and ask, what happened to so
and so?

 Who is the worst landlord in the city?
 Where is public money going for infrastructure improvements? Who stands to gain?
