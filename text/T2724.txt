The High Price of Homeland Security Contracting:
Tips from Washington Post reporters Robert O’Harrow Jr. (oharrowr@washpost.com)
and Scott Higham (highams@washpost.com)
Here are some thoughts about how to begin covering the important but challenging
subject of government contracting. We focus on the federal government, but the ideas
apply more generally.
1. Take time up front to learn about contracting and federal acquisition regulations.
• Learn the differences between contract officers and COTRs; schedule contracts
and ID/IQs; the contracting world on paper and in real life.
• Understand what documentation is supposed to be in every contract file and what
is commonly missing.
• Cultivate a contracting officer or former contracting officer to help translate the
nuances.
2. File Freedom of Information Act requests.
• File early in your project. Consider suing the government at the first missed
deadline.
• Cross your fingers.
3. Seek out official sources outside the normal public affairs/FOIA channels.
• If you’re working with the Department of Homeland Security, you might consider
reaching out to press and contracting officials at the component agencies.
• Be gentle and matter-of-fact in making requests for contract documents, and ask
for electronic copies that can be e-mailed. Sometimes you’ll get lucky.
4. Read through the contract documents that you get -- every page, from cover sheets to
the final modification.
• Take note of the contract officers’ names and how they constantly change over
time. Find those who have left the agency.
• Look for agencies piggy-backing on existing contracts to avoid new competition.
• Track spending patterns. Contracts often end up costing twice as much or more
than originally projected.
5. Get on the ground. Go to the site of a project and scope out the situation.
• A visit to the worksite or a contractor’s hometown or facility almost always
provides insights.
• The scenes and characters you find in the field help the very difficult task of
making contract stories come alive.

6. Knock on doors.
• Find current and former contract officials and contractors and visit them at home.
• Don’t shy away from staking out potentially important sources. (This may seem
like boring contracting stuff, but it’s really about one of the best subjects of all:
money.)
• Share material, insights and even your confusion about a subject (when
appropriate) to get help and gain the trust of sources. There are more people out
there outraged about fraud, waste and abuse than you realize. Some of them will
help you.
7. Go old school and make timelines of every contract and government project.
• Timelines help to simplify complex series of events and sometimes show
connections that you did not know were there.
• They can serve as the bone for great explanatory graphics.
8. Don’t be afraid to draw your own conclusions, at least for the basis of reporting.
• If a contract officer or senior official can’t produce documentation for contract
changes or additions to a contract, press them on why. Get them on the record.
Write a story.
• If a government agency claims that a contract will be worth $1 billion over five
years, and it appears from your reading of the contract and modifications that
they’re on a pace to spend $1 billion over two years, you may have a story about
runaway spending.
