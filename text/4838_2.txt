Inside the Gold Rush
~OR~
HOW A CHEAP URINE TEST MADE MILLIONAIRES OF
FRAUDSTERS, RIPPED OFF INSURERS, BAMBOOZLED WALL
STREET, AND EXPLOITED VULNERABLE ADDICTS IN SEARCH
OF HELP.

Turning a $35 test into $2,500: Key ingredients

Point Of Care: Cheap, fast Urine Drug Test; literally the
‘gold standard’
Confirmatory testing: Expensive, exhaustive,
rarely needed on routine basis,
IOP: Intensive outpatient program for
recovering addicts. Paid by insurance.
Sober homes: Residences where people in
recovery can live in a sober environment.

Doing the Lord’s work. Or not.

Red flags
• Self dealing through
overlapping sober
house/IOP, lab
ownership
• Free sober home rent,
cash, gift cards in
exchange for regular
urine testing

The business of sober homes:
Unregulated, federally protected

 Sober housing is a business, but

addiction is a disease

 Housing cannot be tracked or

regulated based on a person’s
disease

 People cannot be zoned into or out

of neighborhoods based on a
person’s disease

 Fair housing, HIPPA and ADA protect

industry abuses; Congressional
discussion of amending the ADA

Senior citizens, biker drugs, toe tags
Confirmatory drug
testing:
All patients, all drugs,
all the time
Doctors: Cups, threats, fabulous cash prizes
Senior citizens: Millions in Medicare billings for Angel Dust alone

Weird Science: Kids with ADD, pregnant women in poverty, smokers

“A culture of intimidation”

Monetizing a fraud
 Leveraged loans
 Bundled into CLOs, sold as

though they are a stock

 No transparency
 Benefits insiders via “special

dividends”

The CLO Trickledown

“The Big Wink”


DOJ settlement hinges on bankruptcy deal.



TA Associates and Slattery must pay a combined $365
million as part of the deal.



Without the money, the bankruptcy deal collapses.



Without the bankruptcy deal, Millennium collapses and
everyone gets nothing.



TA and Slattery refuse to pay unless they get protection
from any civil fraud charges.



And the Wink: DOJ said it was an innocent bystander
when it came to the bankruptcy plan allowing Slattery, a
key architect of the fraud, to walk away rich.

… and James Slattery gets
Freedom from
pesky fraud suits, an
estimated $400
million from the
collapsed CLO, and
this modest
waterfront home in
South Florida, still
home to a billion
dollar piss test
empire that has
enriched players
big and small.
