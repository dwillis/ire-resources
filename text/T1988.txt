One of the trickiest things about social network analysis is the lingo used. Because of
this, it tends to be a bit more researcher-friendly than journalist-friendly. But it isn’t impossible,
and with a little bit of studying you’ll be speaking the language in no time.
To really learn this stuff, most people recommend Social Network Analysis: A Handbook,
by John Scott; and Social Network Analysis: Methods and Applications, by Stanley Wasserman
and Katherine Faust. Scott’s book is a bit simpler and a great place to start, but once you get
going you’ll find the technical explanations from Wasserman and Faust to be a great help.

Here are some basic terms to get you started:
Matrix—Think of a data matrix as a mathematical way of representing relationships. Each matrix
is a table consisting of rows and columns. Numbers and labels are filled in as necessary. Network
matrices can be displayed visually as a graph with software such as NetDraw. Here is a makebelieve example of a simple matrix of acquaintances. See Figure 1. The names along the left are
the rows of the matrix and the names across the top are matrix columns. A “1” denotes the
presence of a relationship and a “0” means that the two people do not know one another:

Lines and Nodes—In a graph of a network, the lines represent relationships or connections.
(Note: Lines are also called links, arcs, ties.) The nodes, or points, represent the people,
organizations, etc. that you are researching. (Note: Nodes are also called points, elements, actors.)
See Figure 2:

Geodesic—The path distance separating two actors is the length of the shortest indirect
path, or the geodesic. For example, the shortest path from Barney to Bert would include
Oscar. See Figure 3.

Degree—The degree of a node is expressed as the number of lines that connect to it. For
example, in our example network Barney and Oscar have a degree of two and Bert and Ronald
have a degree of one. This is shown visually in Figure 4:

Adjacent—Two points connected to one another by a line have a direct relationship. They are
adjacent. Adjacency is simply another way to describe direct relationships. Barney is adjacent to
Oscar and Ronald because he is connected to both nodes. However, Barney is not adjacent to Bert
because there is no line, or relationship, connecting them. See Figure 4.
Centrality—Centrality is a network analysis tool that takes into consideration the location of
actors within the network. Measures of centrality are some of the most common measures in
network analysis. The reason centrality is so important is because it measures prominence and
prestige within the network. Centrality also places importance on and gives meaning to the
location of actors within a graph. There are several different types of centrality that you can
measure in UCINET, they include: Betweenness, Closeness, Power and Degree Centrality. For
this exercise we’re going to focus on degree centrality and betweenness.
Degree centrality— This centrality measure indicates the extent to which a node is connected to
other nodes in the network. It measures the number of connections each person has to others in
the network. For example, if you had a matrix of a group of friends, it would show which person

2

in that group is the most “popular.” In Figure 5, Barney and Oscar have the highest degree
centrality because they both have two connections. Their degree centrality is two.

Betweenness Centrality—This centrality measure indicates the ability to control transactions or
communications between others in the network. It is measured as the extent that one node/actor
lies on the geodesics that connect other pairs of nodes/actors indirectly. “The betweenness of a
point measures the extent to which an agent can play the part of a ‘broker’ or gatekeeper’ with a
potential for control over others” (Scott, 86). For example, Barney and Oscar have the highest
betweenness scores in this network. This is because if someone in the network wanted to
communicate with Bert they would have to go through Oscar first, and if someone wanted to
communicate with Ronald they would have to go through Barney first. See Figure 6:

only connection
to Bert. He has

and the rest of
the network.

Affiliation network/data—This is a two-mode network, containing a set of actors and a set of
events. Think of the corporate board of director example. The actors are the directors and the
events are the company boards they sit on. It is different from the example above because we are
adding another set of nodes to the matrix. Instead of just friends, we now have friends and the
groups they are affiliated with. The two separate “modes” are friends and groups. A matrix
representing this type of network might look something like Figure 7. A visual representation of
such a network is shown in Figure 8:

Valued Data—Relationships in this type of data carry a value. Instead of binary numbers
(0’s and 1’s) simply representing a connection as in the examples above, the numbers in
this matrix mean more. For example, you could put a number representing how many
times one person in your network spoke on the phone with another. For example, if
Barney called Ronald four times, you would place a “4” where their names intersect in
the matrix, see Figure 9. This kind of data allows you to measure the strength of a
relationship. Shown graphically, this strength is defined as Tie Strength, see Figure 10:

From this view you can see that the
relationship between Ronald and Barney is the
strongest in the network based on the number
of times they spoke to one another. Their tie
strength is shown by the thickness of the lines
in the graph.
