HUNTING FOR DOCUMENTS
STATE FOIA TIPS AND TRICKS

ASK INFORMALLY FIRST
• Generally best first step
• Particularly if you’re looking for small datasets
• Eg. do you keep ’stats on mental illness rates in prisons?’
• Sometimes I ask spokesperson: ‘can you provide these records or
would you prefer I file as a public records request?’

PERKS OF INFORMAL REQUEST:
• Can get records MUCH faster (In Pa. at least)
• Agency will have a better idea of what you want if you file a
formal request later

• Sometimes you get docs/data that agency might be less likely to
give formally

INVESTIGATION: FROM PATIENTS TO PRISONERS
OCT. 2015

• Investigation into revolving
door of mentally ill people in
Pa. prisons

• Heavy use of state and
county data acquired through
informal requests

INVESTIGATION: FAILING THE FRAIL
JULY, 2016

• Investigation into deadly
nursing home care in Pa.

• Heavy use of publiclyavailable data and docs on
nursing home quality

• Acquired most state data
informally

BUT… SOMETIMES YOU JUST GOTTA FILE
• You don’t have time to keep nagging a public agency
• You’re fishing
• You know an agency will be reluctant to release docs
• You want a huge amount of data/docs
• The agency is completely un-cooperative

INVESTIGATION: DEFYING THE ODDS
(PUBLISHING SEPT 12)

• Found 1,700 Americans have
claimed 50+ lottery tix worth
$600+ between 2010-2016

• In many cases, improbable to win
that often

• Previous investigations have
sometimes found frequent winners
engaged in crime.

46+ RECORD REQUESTS
• Asked for prize claim claims data
from every state lottery

• Asked for odds on lottery games
• Also asked for lottery investigative
reports

GENERAL HEADACHES:
• New Hampshire declined to send data because it could be
“manipulated."

• Michigan declined to provide the last names of players.
• In many cases, lotteries didn’t have odds data in consolidated files.
• In most cases, lotteries declined to release investigation reports.

CHALLENGE: STATE RESIDENCY
• PROBLEM: TN and AK denied our
requests because we weren’t “state
residents”

• SOLUTION: found other reporters to
file requests on our behalf

CHALLENGE: HUGE FEES
• PROBLEM: Colorado wanted to charge us
$6,000

• SOLUTION: We negotiated with agency –
limited timeframe of our request

CHALLENGE: NAME DISCLOSURE
• PROBLEM: Some states don’t disclose
winner names, including SC

• SOLUTION: Negotiated with agency –
Asked if they could tell us the top most
frequent winners with names redacted

CHALLENGE: OBSTINATE AGENCY
• PROBLEM: NM Lottery denied request, ignored my calls
and emails for clarity.

• SOLUTION:
• Told agency I was filing a complaint with New Mexico Attorney General
• Requested to speak with lottery director
• Filed two new requests for records: record retention schedule, all email
records regarding my original request

• Lottery director called me, released records I wanted that day.

GENERAL ADVICE
• Stay organized – file folders, spreadsheet of requests (google
sheets = amazing if collaborating)

• Read relevant excerpts of public records law – cite when needed
• Contact your state press association for help with denials
• Be firm but friendly when dealing with records custodians
• Persistence will pay off

RECORD REQUEST INSPIRATION
• Look up David Cullier’s presentation from IRE 2017.
• Great ideas for record requests on any beat + advice for
negotiating with record custodians
