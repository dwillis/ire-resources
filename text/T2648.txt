Updated Data
1. American Community Survey: http://www.census.gov/acs/www/.
Annual survey that asks many of the same questions as the decennial census. It covers
the broad categories of demographics, housing and economics for populations. It is to
replace the long form beginning in 2010. It is released every summer. It has been
available for areas with at least 250,000 people until recently. This summer, expected
first release of data on places with populations of 65,000 and over. In 2008, the first
data for places with at least 20,000 people are to be released, as three-year averages.
It’s data very similar to Census, though not in the same population group detail. The
data is available at http://factfinder.census.gov/home/saff/main.html.
2. Population estimates: http://www.census.gov/popest/estimates.php.
Estimates for towns/states/nation. Different data come out at different times – county
estimates are due out in “mid-March,” according to the bureau. Last state and national
estimates came out last December. These include births, deaths and migration, and age,
sex, broad race and Hispanic origin. Town estimates are simply a population estimate,
but it’s the only number you can get down to this level. The site can be confusing; you
can also find the data at the American Factfinder home above.
3. Other: Includes Economic -- http://www.census.gov/econ/census02/ -- (types of
businesses, counts and receipts, every 5 years, 2002 data available now, some at the
county level); Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates -http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/saipe/saipe.html (annual, 2003 most recent for
states, counties and school districts; next scheduled is November 2006); Building
Permits -- http://www.census.gov/const/www/permitsindex.html -- (numbers by
town/county/state/US, fairly up-to-date, January 2006 is most recent, less than two
months behind).
2000 Data
Still useful when it’s the only game in town (for details and small geographies, it is).
All available through http://www.census.gov/main/www/cen2000.html.
SF1 – These are actual counts but basic information: Totals, ages, sex, races,
households, families and housing units. They go down to the smallest level – blocks (no
more than a few hundred people).
SF2 – SF1 broken down for 249 population groups. As a practical matter, because
Census won’t show data for groups of less than 100, you often won’t get blocks, but
you can get towns and tracts.

SF3 – The juicy tidbits. Education, income, occupations, veterans, disabled, ancestry,
citizenship, language skills, mobility, home values, rents and mortgages for the basic
racial groups and Hispanic. Down to block groups and tracts. Note that these are
estimates.
SF4 – SF3 for 336 racial and ancestry groups. Down to towns and tracts.
PUMS – A percentage of the actual answers people put on their forms. This is great for
getting answers to more complex questions. Huge database. Limitless possibilities.
Recent Stories
1. Aging. Oldest boomers turning 60 this year. New Census report finds senior
citizens are healthier, wealthier and wiser. A 254-page pdf. But chock full of ideas.
Press kit is at: http://www.census.gov/PressRelease/www/releases/archives/news_conferences/006545.html.
2. Business and women. The number of businesses owned by women grew faster than
businesses owned by men from 97-02. From the Economic Census. Report is 873
pages in pdf, but there are data access pages: http://www.census.gov/PressRelease/www/releases/archives/business_ownership/006351.html
3. Housing. NYT Sunday had a story on rise in number of apartments in NYC owned
as second homes. Used Census 2000 and ACS data. Story is at:
http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/05/nyregion/05pied.html?_r=1&oref=slogin
More story ideas (Easy to do)
1. Daytime populations, vs. residential population. Terrorism implications, can use to
check against federal funding. (October 2005 release).
2. Demographic/race changes, numbers to back up stories on neighborhoods changing,
growth, migration. Also stories on languages spoken, how are schools dealing with
these – implications for No Child Left Behind.
3. Elections – compare results or turnout with demographics (seniors voting,
seniors/families with kids and school budgets). Tables. Maps.
4. Housing stories – development trends from building permits, million dollar homes
from ACS.
5. Poverty. Significant increases changing communities, or perhaps decreases? How
much is economic vs. changes in the character of areas.
Whatever you do, think Census
The Chicago Tribune’s mortgage fraud package of last year used Census housing data.
Think PUMS to pull out data – you can at least get close to defining things Census
didn’t, like the size of your local sandwich generation.
