Investigating Public Health
Assess performance
•

Has your city, county or state health department responded to a disaster or an outbreak? Get a
copy of the agency’s ”after-action” report detailing lessons learned in their response. Did they
get any federal assistance? If so, ask for any federal reports on the incident.

•

Have they conducted emergency training exercises or drills? Ask for copies of reports
produced after the drill that give the agency’s lessons learned.

•

Find out how the agency measures its own performance. Do individual divisions of the agency
have goals? What are they and how do they measure progress toward those goals. Are certain
divisions performing better than others?

•

Examine performance reports prepared by state health agencies for local health departments.

•

Know how the system is supposed to work by reading the agency’s response plan or
protocols. How does that compare to what actually happened?

•

Look for disconnects between various agencies, failed hand-offs or notifications between local,
state, federal or international health authorities.

•

Look for larger trends: Significant turnover in key staff, unfilled jobs, key positions with “acting”
directors for significant periods of time. The federal government conducts the Federal Human
Capital Survey of employee job satisfaction every two years, which is a useful barometer of
employee morale and an agency’s ability to retain staff. www.fhcs2006.opm.gov/

•

Compare local laws/authorities and performance with those in other states. What’s your state’s
ability to isolate or quarantine a person? How quickly can it happen? Are there hurdles that
aren’t found in other states?

Follow the Money
•

Most of the $8 billion budget for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is sent to
states in the form of grants. Look at how this money is spent – or in some cases not spent – by
state and local officials. What’s the public getting for this money?

•

Bioterrorism funds: While many news organizations have reported on how Homeland Security
funds have been spent locally, few have reported on a similar pool of funds from the CDC.
Many states aren’t spending the money they’ve been given, according to this HHS Inspector
General’s report: http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region5/50500031.pdf

•

HIV/AIDS prevention funds: Examine state and federal reports on the performance of CDC
grant recipients, which often are nonprofit groups. The HHS Inspector General has cited CDC
for funding groups even though they have reported little accomplishments or their performance
was considered “abysmal.” http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region4/40308011.htm

• Other types of CDC grants range from tuberculosis and STD elimination to funds for pandemic
flu preparedness. For a list of funding opportunities to states go to
www.cdc.gov/od/pgo/funding/FOAs.htm

• Is your state getting its fair share of federal public health funding? Is it applying for all the
money it could receive? http://healthyamericans.org/reports/shortchanging06/
•

Outsourcing: Is the agency hiring private contractors to perform work traditionally done by
government public health workers? Is it saving money? Are the contacts competitively bid?

Examine perks
•

Look at employee incentive programs, cash bonuses, retention bonuses, educational leave,
cars for executives, and private jets. Who is being rewarded and why?

Some key resources

Trust for America’s Health: This nonprofit organization, unlike many other national public
health groups, accepts no funding from the CDC or other government agencies. They regularly
examine issues relating to public health and preparedness. www.tfah.org Press contact: Laura
