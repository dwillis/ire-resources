Sure, it’s easier to cover something when you’re there, but you can still do some great
reporting by combining knowledge of Long Island and use of the Internet and your phone.
Many of the websites listed here are on a website ace journalist Deb Nelson and I have
put together at InvestigateWashington.org – a site you can bookmark and use a guide when you
need to access Congress, the Supreme Court, the White House and federal agencies.
What follows is a list of websites you can use to track legislation. It will provide you with
names of lawmakers, their staff members, advocates and lobbyists to call and flesh out the story.
Look up the bill at Congress.gov
Get a quick lesson in how laws are made at https://www.congress.gov/legislative-process
Find bill sponsors’ press contacts in the House at https://directory.house.gov/#/ and in the
Senate at http://www.periodicalpress.senate.gov/press-contacts/
Follow the process by signing up for alerts at GovTrack.us, or check with the Senate at
https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/legislative/b_three_sections_with_teasers/active_leg_page.htm

See how House and Senate committees handle bills at their websites, where you often can
watch streaming or stored video of hearings and “mark up” sessions where lawmakers amend
and change the bill. For the House, find committees at http://www.house.gov/committees/ and
for the Senate go to https://www.senate.gov/committees/committees_home.htm
Find an analysis of the issue or the bill by the Congressional Research Service – which
provides nonpartisan history, background facts and analysis on many issues and legislations, at
