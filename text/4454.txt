Before you ever start, remember…

WE’RE ALL HUMAN

WE’RE ALL HUMAN…
•

We all have family, kids, vacations & job troubles
• If you need an ice-breaker – these are your go-to topics

•

We all know pain
• Pain of watching someone get hurt or die
• Pain of losing a job, money or our reputation

YOU HAVE TO GET IN THEIR HEAD:
WHAT ARE THEY WORRIED ABOUT?
•

Will I lose my job, my money or my life?

•

Will I go to jail?

•

Who ratted me out? Who is the whistleblower?

•

If this reporter knows, who else knows?

•

How much does she actually know?

•

Do I need to call a lawyer? Do I need a news conference?

•

Is my house a mess? Do I need to clean?

•

Will I look fat, stupid, ugly or all of the above?

For the most part, there are

THREE TYPES OF INTERVIEW SUBJECTS

THREE TYPES OF SUBJECTS
• ORDINARY FOLK
• EXPERTS
• THE ACCUSED
• THE SIT-DOWN OR CONTROLLED INTERVIEW

• THE CONFRONTATION OR “UNSCHEDULED INTERVIEW”

ORDINARY FOLK
• First-timers who have never been interviewed

• Victims or other people who are hurting or angry
• Full of emotion
• These are your storytellers

VICTIMS IN PARTICULAR ARE…
• Afraid of the camera

• Afraid of themselves
• Afraid of the accused
• Afraid of their own emotions

MAKE THEM COMFORTABLE…
• Walk in with minimal gear
• Explain in detail how the interview process will go
• As others are setting up, talk to them about
something they are proud of…

• Look for family portraits, medals & plaques, the kids’
chore chart, home décor, sporting & hunting
equipment, yard work…

TELL THEM…
• They are smart & brave (because they are)

• They are beautiful or handsome (because they
are)
• This is going to be really hard and you can stop
anytime if it gets too hard

START FROM THE BEGINNING
• “OK…let’s start from the very beginning…how
did the day start?”
• Let them talk. They’ve rehearsed what they’re
going to say. Let them plow through it without
interrupting.
• Then go back and hash over the details.

IF SOMEONE HAS DIED…
• “What was your favorite thing Jane would do?”

• “I never knew Jane. What was she like?”
• “What is that little thing you never thought much
about that you now miss so much?”

DON’T BE AFRAID TO CHALLENGE THEM!
• “But when we told the other side what you said, he
said…”
• “Are you sure that’s what happened? How do you
know?” “Is there any chance you made a mistake?”
• “People are going to say, ‘He’s just an old man’”
• SILENCE is your best friend. Don’t jump into the quiet…let
them fill it.

EXPERTS
•

Get them out of the office. Make them demonstrate.

•

LISTEN!!

•

Avoid technical jargon by letting them say whatever it is they’re
prepared to say and then go back over the details

•

Avoid hyper-technical jargon, statistics & acronyms by reminding
them that the average TV viewer has a 6 th grade education.
• “How would you explain it to your kid’s class?”
• “Can you show me?”

THE VICTIM & THE EXPERT: “$1.79”

THE ACCUSED: BEFORE THE INTERVIEW
• Be honest. Lay it all out there.
• Tell them what you got. Don’t burn them.
• “I’m trying to get both sides here. I know you must
have a different version of what happened.”

• “It’s your chance to say you’ve taken a look at it,
you didn’t find anything wrong, you’re going to
make a chance, whatever you want to say.”

THE ACCUSED
IN A CONTROLLED INTERVIEW
•

“This is going to be hard. I am asking you these questions because
it is my job. Just like it’s your job to answer them. It’s not personal.
It is your chance to tell your side of the story.”

•

Plot out exactly what you’re going to say to all of the possible
responses

•

Have follow-ups planned for every possibility

•

Get them to validate what you’re not sure about by asking like you
know it’s true

TECHNIQUES FOR DIFFICULT INTERVIEWS
Just ask the question. Don’t get into an argument or make a
statement.
“Basic is beautiful.” – Julian Scher, IRE National Conference 2014
Don’t give them an easy out.
If they give you a non-answer answer, call them on it and ask
again.

If you don’t understand – tell them. If you don’t get it, it’s not
because you’re stupid – it’s because it doesn’t make sense. If it
doesn’t make sense to you – it doesn’t make sense to your readers
& viewers.

THE “DUMBTY DUMB METHOD”
• Take advantage of their assumptions. If they think
you’re a dumb blonde, awesome.
• Let them talk down to you – this isn’t about your ego.
You know your stuff…but they don’t know that.
• “Wait – I don’t get it. Can you explain it?”
• It gives them a sense of confidence – they lay it out
there for you. And when they say something you know
isn’t true – then you break out the paper, the video,
the proof.

A NEW SLIDE FOR A NEW TREND…
• More and more federal agencies are “going on
background” and not even giving statements anymore
BECAUSE WE’RE LETTING THEM
• You are hurting your journalism, the integrity of your story
and the journalists who follow you.
• It is our fundamental job to hold them accountable.

HOLDING THEM ACCOUNTABLE
• AS A LAST RESORT: If it involves a public official AND the
BIG THREE (true corruption, rape or murder), I very calmly
and politely tell them I will get the interview.
• “It is totally up to you if it’s in a controlled environment
where your boss is well-lit and ready for it or if it’s when
he’s walking to his car with no warning. He won’t like that.
I don’t care if he’s angry with me. But you will care if he’s
angry with you.”
• They will call it “a threat.” I call it “a reality” and refer
them to stories where others didn’t think I was serious.

THE ACCUSED IN AN
“UNSCHEDULED INTERVIEW”
•

Get all of your video before you call

•

Last ditch effort. Reporters get sued because of these
things…

•

NEVER trespass

•

Practice and choreograph with your photographer

•

Bring a third person if at all possible to videotape you & your
photographer…and to call 911 if necessary

THE ACCUSED IN AN
“UNSCHEDULED INTERVIEW”
•

Unlike other interviews, your questions may be the key sound

•

You get one BIG question

•

Be prepared for AT LEAST 2 MORE follow-ups

•

•

Should they be accusatory?

•

Should they contain facts or quotes?

•

Ask them something that will make them mad…

BECAUSE THEY MIGHT STOP…AND DECIDE TO TALK
•

So you better be prepared to do a full-throttle interview

•

And have all your documents/video

THE ACCUSED IN AN UNCONTROLLED &
CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT: BEER BUST

No matter who you interview...

THE GOLDEN RULES

THE GOLDEN RULES

Always shake their hand

•

Tell the truth

•

Get out of the office

•

Don’t lose your cool…ever

•

Be polite, compassionate and kind

•

Be firm

•

Avoid yes and no questions

•

SILENCE IS YOUR BEST FRIEND

•

If you don’t understand…neither do a lot of other people

•

Don’t be afraid to challenge people

•

Don’t be afraid to ask the same question over and over again
