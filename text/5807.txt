What is life, really?

Signs of the post-project blu

es

üåß Topics that once interested
you seem boring, or daily work
seems unimportant

Signs of the post-project blu

es

üåß You wonder if what you do
really makes a difference, and
you lack motivation.

Signs of the post-project blu

üåß You feel like a lonely sailboat
at sea and without wind

WARNING!
POST-PROJECT BLUES ARE LEGIT. THEY‚ÄôRE TERRIBLE.
THEY DERAIL REPORTERS. THEY CONFOUND EDITORS.
TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY.
8

THROW A
Go out and report a totally different
kind of story. Surprise people.
9

GET
Reconnect with the right side of your
brain. Go paint. Draw a picture. See
your favorite band. Craft. Bake.
10

TAKE A
No doubt you deserve some time off.
Unwind your brain and reset. Go to
your happy place. Return refreshed.
11

SEEK
Ask someone you admire to lunch.
Talk about why they do what they
do, and why it‚Äôs important to them.
12

KEEP A
Never stop Ô¨Åling records requests.
There‚Äôs no time for the blues if
you‚Äôve got ideas in the hopper.
13

STAY
This is a common part of the project
cycle, and you‚Äôre not alone. Just give
it a little time.
14

ASSESS
Is it time for a change of beat? A
change of job? Where do you want
your career to go next?
