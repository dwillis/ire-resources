Since
1990, thethe
Electronic
Frontier Foundation
has worked
to ensure that rights
About

and freedoms are enhanced and protected as our use of technology grows.

We champion user privacy, free expression, and innovation through impact
litigation, policy analysis, grassroots activism, and technology development.

EFF Threat Lab
The EFF Threat Lab conducts
deep-dive investigations into
surveillance technologies, particularly
as they are used to spy on journalists,
activists, and other targeted
populations.

Street-Level Surveillance

Drones
License plate readers
Cell-site simulators
Body-worn cameras
Biometrics (face recognition)

Police databases
Gunshot detection
Camera networks
Social media monitoring
Real-time crime centers

Questions We Are Asked All the Time

Hey! What police departments have XXX
technology?
Hey! I live in the City of XXX. What
surveillance tech do the local police have?

Atlasofsurveillance.org
Project Goals:
Research: Create a searchable inventory of
law enforcement surveillance technologies
across the United States.
Engagement: Collaborate with and inspire a
huge number of people (students and
volunteers) in crowdsourcing research
through a new online tool.

Law enforcement surveillance tech
isn’t always secret. It’s online.
It just hasn’t been aggregated.

The Public Interest
Freedom
Privacy
Justice
Security
Waste/Fraud/Abuse

Always Ask These Questions
1.

What data is being collected?

2.

How is it being collected?

3.

How long is data stored and went is it deleted?

4.

Who can access the system and data?

5.

What are the deﬁned purposes for which the system may
accessed or used?

6.

How is the system audited?

7.

Has is it been breached or misused?

8.

How do you measure its effectiveness?

9.

How much does the system cost and how is it paid for?

Common Problems with Surveillance
Mass surveillance: Many forms
collect information on you
regardless of whether you’ve
committed a crime
Errors: Surveillance tech can make
mistakes that negatively impact
innocent people

Common Problems with Surveillance
Disproportionate: Can result in disproportionate or unequal
policing of neighborhoods
Racial/Socio-Economic Impact: Often disproportionately harms
people of color
Chilling Effects: Can discourage or suppress free expression,
freedom of the press, the right to organize, the freedom to
worship and other human rights

Common Problems with Surveillance
Secrecy: Use often kept secret, even
from courts
Misuse: Prone to abuse by bad
actors and rogue ofﬁcials within an
agency
Waste: Can be a poor use of public
money

Common Problems with Surveillance
Proﬁt motivated: Can lead to
policing driven by sales
relationships rather than
community needs
Cybersecurity: Can be vulnerable
to breaches by malicious external
actors

The Biggest Problem
Surveillance isn’t just about public safety or solving
crimes: it’s control.
Mass collection of data, combined with analytical software, will
be used to control, inﬂuence and manipulate society.
Sometimes by intent. Sometime by accident.
Sometimes in the open. Sometimes invisibly.

The Technologies

Drones (aka UAV, sUAS)
In Practice:
●
●
●
●
●
●
●
●

Document crime and
accident scenes
Surveil large gatherings,
such as protests
Hostage situations
SWAT operations
Search & Rescue
Fires
Marijuana farms
Building compliance

Drones: 1,079 Agencies

Transportation

Face Recognition in Practice
Police May Use Face Recognition for:
●
●
●

Identity conﬁrmation
“Forensic” use with evidence
Real-time surveillance

Police May Deploy Face Recognition
●
●
●

On workstations
On mobile devices

Face Recognition: 366+ Agencies

Body-worn Cameras

Became widespread
during Obama
administration
Expanded through US
DOJ funding
Pitched as police
accountability tool
Law enforcement now

video analysis, including
face recognition

Body-Worn Cameras: 1,331 (Very Underinclusive)

Automated License Plate Readers (ALPRs)

ALPRs in Practice
Real-time alerts: Police can add a vehicle to a “hot list” and get an alert every time the
target vehicle is seen by an ALPR camera.
Historical travel patterns: Police can query where a particular vehicle has traveled,
sometimes going years back
Search by Location: Police can query what vehicles were seen near an address or set of
addresses
Network mapping: Police can query what vehicles were photographed in the vicinity of
other vehicles
Predictions: Police can receive algorithmic predictions on where a vehicle might be at a
given time
Data Sharing: Widespread sharing of data, so drivers can be tracked across the county

Automated License Plate Readers: 534 Agencies (Underinclusive)

Gunshot Detection

International Association of Chiefs of Police
Conferences
“Procurement and adoption is driven by people at
this conference. We really admire that.”

Conference Apps

AWS’s Relaxation Zone

“Leveraging today’s
technology to help keep our
citizens safe is a key focus of
our department. Our
partnership with Ring and use
of the Neighbors app will
deﬁnitely help in our crime
ﬁghting efforts.”
- Chief Billy Grogan.

Look for Accountability Measures in Laws
Examples of transparency elements buried in state law:
●

Washington state law requires disclosure of cell-site simulators and
pen-traps to courts.

●

Maryland law requires annual detailed disclosure of aggregate use
of automated license plate readers to the legislature

●

California law requires disclosure of when agencies track cell-phone
location or request records from online service providers

Policies, Practices, Standard Operating
Procedures

Most law enforcement agencies craft policy documents explaining how
the technology is used.
This policy may describe:
●
●
●
●
●

How it may be used in an investigation
Who may use it and what training is required
How information is stored and accessed
How use is logged
Audits and accountability measures

Look for descriptions of documents that may exist.
Not having a policy is a story.

Slideshows can be especially useful
-

Training materials

Presentations before elected bodies
Academic institutions

Slide from San Diego agency's presentation at a law enforcement conference

Vendor Manuals
If you can obtain the user manual from a particular
company’s product, you can learn a lot about how it
operates and what kinds of data you can obtain.

Usage Logs
Law enforcement agencies often need to keep track
of technology:
- When it’s used or accessed
- When it’s checked in and out of storage
- When it’s transferred to another department
