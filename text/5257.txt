Some tips before starting
the exercise

What were you drawing?
And on level of difficulty, how tough was it?

Here is the full drawing.

You were
drawing this
dude. Upside
down.

I am a
journalist
turned artist. I
would see
these scenes,
and they would
stay in my
head. They felt
like a kind of
truth to me.

I figured this out
when I was 32,
and I couldn’t
draw or paint to
save my life
when I first
started. So brain
flipping became
my way of life,
my savior.

The drawing exercise is from the book:
A must-read for anyone who wants to
learn to draw
Which leads us to ask the question:

“What is the difference between the
right and left sides of the brain?”

It’s not what you think!
The common
misnomer is that the
right brain is
“creative” and
“intuitive”, while the
left brain is “logical”
and “fact-based.”

What does right and left brain really mean?
Our left side is our verbal side. It’s
anticipatory, and conceptual, and
applies already known information to
situations.
The right brain is our visual/spatial
side. It pays attention to visual cues shapes, colors, patterns and other
physical cues. It picks up
immediate information and
patterns.

Right versus left: Is the fist bigger or smaller than the head?

Is drawing, or right brain, a born ability?
No. We all lean left, or
verbal, because that’s
the side we are
exercising from birth,
as we learn to talk. We
don’t exercise the right
brain, which is why
most of us think we
don’t know how to
draw.

The neuroscience suggests drawing can help
Activities that require intense concentration, like learning a
language, help stave off dementia, memory loss and other brain
deterioration. Interestingly enough, as we gain mastery over
things, we stop using our whole brain, and that’s when the brain
falls apart. Turns out the brain needs to be exercised much like the
body does.
Also, memory loss is not helped by trying to memorize say, for
example, information on notecards. It’s improved by using
activities that involve the whole brain.

Testing the theory that journalists should draw:
My two experiments:
*For 9 months, I’ve taught
Reuters reporters in New York
drawing. I’ve also started
working with 2 other newsrooms.
*Last October, I spent 1 week with
students at the U. of Nevada
Reno’s journalism school, offering
drawing lessons paired with a
writing assignment.

The results are preliminary, but promising
I believe our experiment
at least anecdotally
demonstrated how
drawing does seem to
clear the mind in a way
that promotes dealing
with complex challenges.
- Bob Felton, Professor, Reynolds School of
Journalism, University of Nevada-Reno

And my fave anecdotal story?
All I know is that I walked into
the room with writer's block,
and then I spent an hour not
thinking about the story at all - I
was trying to draw a flower, and
it was hard. After an hour, I
went back to my desk, and the
story just flowed.
- Selam Berhe, Reuters-New York data team. The
story she references was nominated for a Pulitzer
in 2017

But I can’t draw a stick figure … can I learn to draw?
The key is to set up the conditions that cause
you to make the mental shift to a different
mode of mental processing - the slightly altered
state of consciousness that allows you to see
well. In this drawing mode you will be able to
draw your perceptions even though you may
never have studied drawing.
-Betty Edwards, author of “Drawing on
the Right Side of the Brain”

Why should I learn to draw?
You will delve deeply into a part of your
mind too often obscured by endless
details of daily life. From this experience
you will develop your ability to perceive
things freshly in their totality, to see
underlying patterns and possibilities for
new combinations. Creative solutions to
problems, whether personal or
professional, will be accessible through
new modes of thinking and new ways of
using the power of your whole brain.
-Betty Edwards (the venerable)

Come Learn to Draw with Me Tomorrow!
Don’t let me tell you - let me
show you!
Come join me tomorrow for
a drawing lesson. I’ll
provide all materials, you
provide an open mind and a
willingness to learn.
