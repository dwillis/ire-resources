People lie.
All. The. Time.

Best practices

Look for red flags
◇ When was account created?
◇ How many friends/followers does the account
have?
◇ What else do they tweet/post about? Do they
only retweet/repost?
◇ Do they have a proﬁle photo? (red ﬂags:
generic egg or staged patriotic photo)
◇ Does the name contain numbers or symbols?
◇ What are other people saying in the area?
(location search)

Find the actual person
◇ Google their name and handle, and
relevant keywords
◇ Use free people ﬁnders for more info
(familytreenow.com, pipl.com)
◇ Send direct messages, try to get the
person on the phone, Skype, etc.

Question articles/websites
◇ Check the URL very carefully
◇ Does it have a byline? If no, that’s a
red ﬂag. If yes, contact the writer.
◇ Does it cite sources?
◇ Does it seem too good to be true?
