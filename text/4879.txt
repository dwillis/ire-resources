Sports investigations | IRE New Orleans | June 18, 2016
* Have a backgrounding checklist. If you have access to an online database,
include everything from bankruptcy and court records to property liens and
publicly filed licenses. If not, use Google to get those things and standardize
them. It will come in handy on big investigations. Use it for conventional
profiles, too. Be consistent. You never know what will turn up and when.
* Use social media to track what is being said by athletes; a key way they
communicate.
*Consider how to get video early and telling your story that way; It’s also a
great reporting tool.
* Never get lost in an interview. Don’t just write your questions out in
advance. Arc them so you think in terms of sections. If the interviewee
starts wandering in Section 1, move him or her to Section 2. Also have (b)
and (c) options. I’ve gone into some interviews with as many as 200
questions to choose from — and only used a dozen. Especially important
for broadcast, when you only get one shot.
* Think like a writer. Not all investigations are nuts and bolts. Some leave
room for literary touches. Ask a throwaway question to give yourself time
to jot down notes about the person, scene etc.
* Have a cop-and-courts reporter mindset when investigating sports: do the
records requests, build sources, be sure get out in the field.
* Work with beat reporters and consider possible blowback of the
investigation and whether they want to be in it.
* Consider publishing your investigation as a running story, not a major
series. This works if it's building on major news and/or if revealing some
piece of the story might produce tips and sources.

* Use spreadsheets to keep a spreadsheet of your records requests. Use it
as a tickler file to follow up. Also, create a timeline in a spreadsheet early
and fill as you go; great reporting tool; gets a start on multi-media.

* Be persistent and firm when requesting public records. Do not threaten
to sue unless your organization is willing to back you up.
* Don't stick to just one aspect of the story (i.e., academic fraud). Consider
other threads that involve key players in university leadership.
* Don't just rely on flaks and record guardians. Go to the custodians (i.e.,
flight records of university planes); Have family members go with you to get
medical records.
* Anticipate when big developments are coming -- the release of a report,
the indictment of a professor, possible probation/sanction from the
accrediting commission -- and look to write a revealing advance or be ready
to flesh out a big bomb.
* Know when extra troops are needed, especially for digital work. Be ready
for video opportunities, such as when officials who have been hiding for
months now have to pop up and explain themselves.
* Have regular meetings of key staff when the story is running hot and
heavy, or is about to. Dedicate someone to tweeting, someone to the longform report, others for important sidebars, quote rails, timeline updating,
posting of reports, exhibits, etc.
* Guard against digital platforms that wipe out prior work. Editors need to
be aware that the dedicated website that serves to introduce newcomers
to the big story may have disappeared.
* Get the best audience for your work using social media and direct
contacts with those covering the sport.
