Covering Superfund sites in your
community under a Trump/Pruitt
administration
Scott Fallon, @NewsFallon

Garfield, NJ
A factory town born out of the Industrial
Revolution where small textiles and chemical
plants are surrounded by the homes of
workers. 2010 pop: 30,000

E.C. Electroplating, 125 Clark St., Garfield

E.C. Electroplating
● A small, family-owned chrome plating
business founded during the Great
Depression.
● They plated hexavalent chromium onto
machine parts to stem corrosion.
● Hexavalent chromium has been known to
cause cancer of the respiratory system since
the late 19th century.

Dec. 14 1983
Almost three tons of hexavalent
chromium spills into the ground from a
broken valve at this E.C. tank.

● The NJ Department of Environmental
Protection is immediately notified.
● E.C. hires contractors to investigate spill and
start siphoning the chromium from the
ground.

April 1993
● Firefighters at Fire Company 3 - less than a
mile from E.C. - notice greenish water
seeping into the basement after heavy rain.
● The city takes samples and finds more than
250 times the level the state considered safe
for chromium.
● The firehouse is closed. It remains so today.

More incidents
● 2000: Two homes a half mile from the plant
have chromium in their basements.
● 2001: Chromium is found at two other
contaminated sites that never before had it.
● 2003: Chromium is found at the Golden
Towers Senior Complex three blocks from
E.C.

A pattern emerges
● Chromium seeps into the senior complex
basement every time it floods. When the
water evaporates, chromium dust is left on
the floor or becomes airborne.
● And because of a shallow water table,
basements often flood in Garfield.

EPA takes over
● In 2008, the EPA begins testing basements
in a neighborhood of 600 homes and
businesses.
● By 2009, they had found high levels in 13
basements.
● In 2010, they found 2,500 times the federal
safety standard for chromium on the
basement stairs of a building just blocks
from E.C.
● The Agency for Toxic Substances and
Disease Registry issues a rare public health
advisory and recommends the neighborhood
be placed on the Superfund list.

Bottom line: Everyone is at risk

"We consider the site a
serious threat to
human health."
-Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the ATSDR.
October 2010

How did it get to this?
● Spill happened in 1983
● Warning signs in 1993, 2000, 2001,
2003

What the documents revealed
Only three months after the spill, E.C.'s
engineers reported to NJDEP that the
chromium was migrating away from the E.C.
plant towards the Passaic River.
But nobody at the DEP or the company
mentioned the hundreds of homes and
businesses that stood between the plant and
the river.

What the documents revealed
Despite knowing all this, the NJDEP allowed
E.C. to suspend all clean up efforts less than
two years after the spill and with only 30
percent of the chromium recovered.

What the documents revealed
Three decades of:
● poor decisions,
● lax enforcement
● bureaucratic indifference
The totality of the documents showed how an
environmental oversight system failed the
people it was supposed to protect.

In the ensuing years, the Garfield neighborhood of 300
homes and businesses becomes a Superfund site.

EPA spends $5 million demolishing
plant and excavating toxic soil,
debris.

EPA approves a $37 million plan to build
a small treatment plant to pump water to
surface and decontaminate it.

A universal story
There are polluted properties in every corner of
the U.S. that present a threat to the people who
live near them.
Like Garfield, there are 400 other “orphaned
sites” across the nation that depend on
taxpayer money to be cleaned up.

Trump’s proposed Superfund cuts
● 33 percent cut from $1.1B to $762M
under White House budget proposal.
● $4.7 billion in 1997 when Superfund
tax was not reauthorized.
● Check orphaned sites (taxpayer
funded cleanups) in your
communities.

Dealing with EPA
The EPA some information on each Superfund site:
http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/
What they don't post:
● Correspondence between polluter and EPA.
● Internal e-mails/memos between EPA staffers.
● All engineering reports from polluter's contractors.
● Other agency documents (OSHA, state regulators, etc.)
● Names: employees, neighbors, lawyers, engineers.
● Raw scientific data
● Public health reports.
FOIA your local EPA regional office to inspect the site
remediation/case file. Region 2 (NY/NJ) has a reading room with
copiers for the public.

Ways around FOIA/EPA:
● Most major Superfund documents are
housed at a site in the impacted
community, usually a library.
● Your state environmental regulator
likely has reams of documents on the
site.

● Town hall may also have a lot of
information.

Document search
Your state regulator may have:
● case files on all of its toxic sites from leaky gas stations
to major industrial sites. They include:
● Engineering reports
● Maps
● Correspondence between a polluter's contractors
(engineers' letters, emails),
● Correspondence between polluter and regulator (fines,
violations, e-mails),
● Correspondence between regulators (internal memos,
e-mails, letters).
● There are so many cases that your state regulator may
not have the manpower to redact information. That
means all names, addresses, etc. are still there.

Rollback of regulations are
important, but don’t forget about
enforcement:
● Track budget cuts to regional offices.
● FOIA payroll before cuts.
● FOIA payroll after cuts.
● Note what divisions have lost
personnel.

Superfund sites with a deep-pocketed
polluter.
● Look for EPA’s Remedial
Investigation/Feasibility studies.
● This lists the cleanup choices along
with cost comparison.
● Excavation vs. Capping.

Tips
Treat it like a cops story...
Assailant: The polluter
Victim: People in pollution's path.
Cop: Environmental regulator
Cons: A lot more technical jargon.
Pros: Investigative files are almost always
open.

Other tips
● Find a Rosetta Stone: EPA terms and
acronyms, NJDEP glossary
● Quantify the problem - EPA Standards.
● Health effects of pollutants - Agency for
Toxic Substances and Disease Registry
● ATSDR ToxFAQs
● WHO Chemical hazards in drinking-water

Lastly, never forget about the people
who have to live with pollution.

EPA official in April 2016 to remove 166,000
tons of contaminated soil rather than putting a
cap over it.

● An advantage: there are so many cases and
so many files that the NJDEP doesn't have
the manpower to redact information. That
means all names, addresses, etc. are still
there.
● Using New Jersey's Open Public Records
Act, I pulled the file for E.C., the firehouse
that had shut in 1993 and several other
properties.

What the documents revealed
Four months after the spill, E.C. reported high
levels of chromium in its basement after a
heavy rain.
But this didn’t trigger any action that if it was
going into E.C.'s basement it could go into
other basements.

By the end of 1985, two things were certain
about the E.C. spill:
Almost 4,000 pounds of the dangerous
chemical was still unaccounted for, coursing its
way under Garfield.
An no one was going to do anything about it.

It just went on and on
Years went by without the DEP checking on the
site. For instance, it took four years for the state
to notice that E.C. was not testing its monitoring
wells for chromium, even though the company
was supposed to file regular reports with the
DEP.
When chromium was found a decade later at
the firehouse, no testing was done in the
neighborhood.

Things may be getting worse
● The plume appears to be spreading after
high levels of chromium were found recently
in monitoring wells just outside the
neighborhood’s boundaries.
● President Obama's 2013 budget does not
provide money for new, federally-funded
Superfund sites.
● The good news is there finally appears to be
action taking place in the neighborhood.
Basements are being tested and cleaned.
The E.C. plant is expected to be demolished
by the end of 2012.

Cross reference
Cross reference sites with documents from
other sources
● OSHA: Most polluted sites are/were once
workplaces.
● Court Records: criminal, civil, tax.
● First responder reports: If there was a spill or
an accident fire, police, hazmat responded.
● Utilities: some public sewer agencies inspect
and fine industry for pollution literally going
down the drain.
