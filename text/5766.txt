2020 Census
Reporting Mistakes
I’ve (Almost) Made So
You Don’t Have To

TIP SHEET:
tinyurl.com/nicar-census-tips

Most people are not familiar
with the census.

67 percent
“somewhat,
not too, or
not at all
familiar”

2020 Census Barriers, Attitudes and Motivators Study (CBAMS) survey results

“The census has
not included a
citizenship
question since
1950...”

This is a #2020census mistake.

“What State (or
foreign country)
was he born in?”
“If foreign born—
Is he naturalized?”
Question about citizenship on the 1950 census worksheet

Question about citizenship on the 1970 census long form

Question about citizenship on the 2018 American Community Survey

Proposed question about citizenship on the 2020 census paper form

A question about citizenship
has not been included
among the census questions
for every household since
1950.

Race and ethnicity questions on the 2020 census

The census does not
consider “Hispanic or Latino”
a race.
(The census is required to categorize it as an ethnicity.)

“The 2020 census
is the ﬁrst online
U.S. census...”

This is a #2020census mistake.

The 2020 census is not the
ﬁrst online U.S. census.
(There was an online option for the 2000 census.
Don’t forget the mail and phone options for 2020.)

“On April 1, the
2020 census is a
year away...”

This is a #2020census mistake.

The census does not start on
Census Day (April 1).
(The oﬃcial start is on Jan. 21, in remote Alaska.
Most households can start responding by mid-March.)

“The 2020 census
will count every
person in the
country...”

This is a #2020census mistake.

The census does not count
every person in the U.S.
(It counts every person living in the country.)

The census does not count
every resident where they
are on Census Day.
(It counts people where they usually live and sleep.)

“In 2010, 74
percent of
people mailed
back their census
forms...”

This is a #2020census mistake.

The census does not collect
information from each
person living in the U.S.
(It collects information about each person by household.)

“The Census
Bureau is
prohibited from
releasing data
identifying
individuals...”

This is a #2020census mistake.

Data about individuals can
be publicly released 72
years after they’re collected.

“According to the
census, close to a
half million
households don’t
have full indoor
plumbing…”

This is a #2020census mistake.

The census is not the
American Community
Survey.

This is a #2020census mistake.

The 2020 census is a sexy
reporting beat.
(Remember: it’s about power and money.)
