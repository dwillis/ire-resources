CHILDREN AND TRAUMA: INTERVIEWING TIPS
Children are inherently vulnerable. When they are caught up in traumatic events -- violence,
natural disaster, crime, grave illness -- they depend on the good judgment of adults to keep
them from further harm. In the news judgments they make every day, reporters,
photographers, editors and producers should be mindful of the responsibility they bear to
report the truth with compassion and avoid subjecting children to the additional trauma of
insensitive or exploitative coverage.
Here are some basic guidelines to follow when the suffering of children becomes news:
General interviewing guidelines:
•

•
•
•
•
•

Seek the informed consent of a parent or guardian before interviewing or
photographing a child. That means explaining to adult and child why you want to talk
with them and how the interview will be used.
Work together to set ground rules for the interview. Be clear about what is on the
record and off the record.
Be sure that a parent or other responsible adult is present. If that is not possible, obtain
an adult's consent before publishing or broadcasting the interview.
Make it clear that you are a journalist reporting the news. Take care not to act as a
friend. Do not make promises to help that you cannot keep.
Find a quiet place for the interview and do what you can to put the child at ease. Strike
a tone that is sincere. Don't talk down to the child.
When the interview is complete, clear all quotes you think you will use with a
responsible adult.

At the scene of a crime or disaster:
•
•
•

•

Avoid interviewing children at the scene. They are very likely in shock and need
comfort, not questioning.
If an on-scene interview is possible, find a quiet place to talk away from the chaos of
emergency personnel and other victims.
Avoid publishing photographs of children without prior permission from a responsible
adult. A photo of an injured child is dramatic and heart-wrenching but can also be
hurtful and embarrassing to the victim.
Ask open-ended questions. "What happened next?" Avoid self-answering questions,
like "Were you scared?"

Traumatized people often make poor decisions. Be prepared for adults or children to
change their minds once the interview is complete. If this happens, don't use the
material.
Be willing to wait until the parents and child are ready to talk, even if that is weeks or
months after the crisis. You will likely get a much better interview.
If a crowd gathers, explain to adults that privacy is wanted.

Give the child as much control as possible over the interview:
•
•
•
•
•

Emphasize that she or he can choose not to answer a question or ask you not to use
sensitive information.
Keep your notebook, camera or recording equipment in view so your interview
subjects can see how their words are being recorded.
Have a point-and-shoot camera available for the child to make his or her own images.
Be aware that children might say what they think you want to hear rather than being
honest
Ask open-ended questions. “What was the hardest part?” is better than questions that
deliver their own answers, like “Were you scared?”

Interviewing children about previous trauma:
•

•
•
•

•
•

•
•

Find out as much as you can about the incident before the interview by talking to
parents, counselors, teachers and medical professionals. Obtain documents such as
police reports and court records outlining the facts.
Ask parents and others if there are topics or details that are especially difficult for the
child to talk about, and be sensitive.
Let the child and parents pick a familiar setting for the interview.
Don’t talk down to children, no matter how young they are. Respect their feelings and
their way of recounting what happened. And be prepared to be surprised: Children
may not grieve the way you expect them to.
Reflect back what a child is telling you and give her a chance to correct errors.
Educate yourself. Talk to counselors, attend education programs, research child
trauma through authoritative websites. Consider what questions are appropriate for
different ages—e.g. a younger child won’t be able to recall chronological details but
can likely describe what toy he was playing with when the hurricane hit.
Children younger than 13 should not be relied upon to provide detailed factual
accounts. Use documents and other sources to corroborate whenever possible.
Don’t ask questions that imply blame, such as “Weren’t you wearing your seatbelt?”
or “Do you always walk alone at night?”

Be aware that retelling a traumatic event can trigger intense emotions in your
interview subject, even years later. Be prepared to deal with strong reactions, or have
someone there who can provide support, such as a trusted family member or
counselor.
Keep the interview to age-appropriate lengths: thirty minutes for those under age 9,
forty-five minutes for children between 10 and 14 and one hour for teens.
Take breaks if a child gets bored or distracted. That may be a child’s way of telling
you he is emotionally drained.
Don’t use information that would embarrass or hurt a child—even with her
permission. Kids will tell you just about anything, but that doesn’t mean you have to
print it—e.g. bedwetting problems or illegal drug use (unless such detail is central to
the story).
Check back with parents and older children after the interview and let them know how
quotes will be used and when your report will run. Send them copies of the story.
