WHAT COULD YOU COVER
IN A YEARLONG
JOURNALISM PROJECT?
Backed by the resources of Marquette University in
Milwaukee and the Pulitzer Prize-winning Milwaukee
Journal Sentinel, O’Brien Fellows spend nine months
researching, reporting and writing the stories they
care most deeply about — stories with the potential
to change policies and improve lives. The O’Brien
Fellowship allows them to do critical work on issues
of vital importance while they mentor the next
generation of journalists.

INTERIM FELLOWSHIP DIRECTOR
“As an O’Brien Fellow, I
experienced firsthand the
positive difference the
fellowship program can
make in pursuit of in-depth
reporting. Now, as director,
I am eager to help others
produce the story of their
career.”

2015–16 O’Brien Fellow and
2008 Pulitzer Prize winner

“What a rich experience. The O’Brien Fellowship not only gave
me the chance to focus on a big project, but also to mentor the
next generation of great storytellers. There’s nothing else like it.”
Jackie Crosby, 2016–17 O’Brien Fellow, The Star Tribune (Minneapolis)

O’Brien Fellows are fully funded and spend an academic year engaging with faculty, students and experts at Marquette. They
return to their newsrooms the next spring with a world-class project and a university-funded student intern for the summer.
