Our investigation
●

●
●
●

Four-part investigation, “Caregivers and Takers,” and “California regulators aren’t
taking action against care homes that ignore wage theft judgments,” in addition to
two other stories published last year via the Associated Press in more than 200
media outlets across the country, including The New York Times, The Washington
Post, ABC-TV and most major outlets in California, including the Los Angeles
Times.
A special report we produced for PBS NewsHour, “Why some residential caregivers
call their jobs ‘indentured servitude.’”
An interactive database that allows the public to learn which operators across the
U.S. have violated minimum wage and other labor laws.
Reveal radio show, “The Unpaid cost of elder care” aired on nearly 500 public radio
stations across the country.

Methodology - Part I
● Analyzed 10 years worth of citations issued by federal and state labor
regulators. U.S. Department of Labor Wage and Hour data:
(https://enforcedata.dol.gov/views/data_catalogs.php)
● Filed more than 50 Freedom of Information Act and public records
requests with federal and state regulators and scoured court ﬁlings
for more details on select cases.

Methodology - Parts II-IV
● Cross reference facilities with outstanding wage theft judgments
(obtained under a PRA request from state labor regulator) with state
licensing data, available online. Result: Labor scoﬄaws continue to
operate illegally in spite of new law.
● Cross reference health and safety violations (state licensing agency)
with federal and state labor violations. Result: Residents neglected in
care homes run by operators who underpay their workers.
● Cross reference names of facilities previously cited or labor violations
with lists of facilities receiving Medicaid reimbursements. Result:
Labor violators continue to receive federal tax dollars.

How to excavate more cases
●

Search US DOL data for repeat or willful violators. Often facilities keep operating and
never pay the back wages.

●

Rising Phoenix: Search state licensing databases, corporate ﬁlings and bankruptcy
records. Some facilities that have been ﬁned for labor or health and safety violations
abandon their LLC and rename themselves to dodge accountability.

●

Look for facilities cited for health and safety violations. These are often the same
employers that mistreat their employees.

●

Search PACER for lawsuits brought by US DOL for minimum wage violations.

●

Search state courts for cases brought by local district attorneys against care homes for
workers’ compensation fraud, payroll tax evasion etc, which often run together with min
wage violations.

Tracking Coronavirus Cases and Deaths in Long-Term Care Facilities

Long-term care data
-- Our dataset is a mix of state and local records, direct confirmations from
facilities, and some federal data.

-- The federal data was published for the first time in June. The federal
government only required nursing homes to report cases and deaths that occurred
after May 2020, effectively missing the worst part of the pandemic in many areas
of the country. The federal data contains obvious errors, including cases that far
exceed the number of beds in a facility. We use it sparingly.

Pitfalls of state data
-- At this point, most states publish some data about covid cases or deaths in
long-term care facilities.
-- Lack of historical data. State frequently have to adjust case and death numbers
down because of errors in their reporting, so it is virtually impossible to track
growth in a reliable way.
-- Not apples to apples. States report wildly different things in different ways.
Some states report only deaths; some report only cases; some only report active
cases; some only report deaths that occurred *inside* of a nursing home.

Strategies and Tips for Daily and Investigative
Senior Facility Coverage

Our Coverage
-

-

We have published more than 120 spot news reports and investigations on coronavirus-related
issues at long-term care facilities.
For the first three months of the pandemic, Texas had no facility-level coronavirus data. So, we
started mapping local locations with outbreaks ourselves. By the time the federal and state
health authorities released data, we had already identified and reported on most Austin-area
nursing homes with outbreaks.
We have built a specialized land page specifically for reports on COVID-19 and long-term care
facilities.
We’ve embedded interactive maps on the landing page that I update weekly with new state and
federal data on nursing home cases.

Digging into specific facilities
○ CMS nursing home compare - https://www.medicare.gov/nursinghomecompare/search.html?
○ Full CMS nursing home dataset - https://data.medicare.gov/data/nursing-home-compare
■ Click “Download CSV Flat Files”

Transparency
●

Don’t just report on the data you’re getting, report on the data you can’t get. When you get the data,
don’t just report what the data tells you - report what it doesn’t tell you. Report the discrepancies.

●

Is your state withholding data? Report on how your state’s access to records compares to other states.

Records to Request
-

State health authority’s long-term care facility database
-

-

Should include nursing home names, Facility ID numbers, full address, type of facility, license status, contact information for owners, bed numbers,
etc.

Policies and procedures (and blank forms)
-

Want to know how nursing home operators are supposed to report deaths? Ask for those policies and procedures. Want to know how health
department officials conduct their investigations into nursing home? Ask for those policies and procedures. Also ask for any forms (blank) used in
relation to those policies and procedures.

-

Investigation reports, surveys, complaints, violations and enforcement records
-

-

Lots of records available online through CMS nursing home compare:
-

-

Closed investigation reports created by the health department will detail problems
Surveys are typically conducted at least yearly and will detail violations and citations
Complaints (might not be public) can also reveal problems. May only be able to get counts
Violation and enforcement records (also request a complete database) can show violations that included fines

Don’t Forget the People
-

The nursing home beat is ultimately about PEOPLE, so humanize your stories
-

-

Solicit tips from your readers and viewers
-

-

The best way we’ve found families to center our stories around is through tips and telling our viewers to reach out to us.

Sources: reporting on sensitive medical issues
-

-

It’s easy to get caught up in the data and reporting on funding problems, government regulation failures, PPE and testing
trends, investigations, etc. But, never forget that at the core of long-term care facilities are residents and workers.

Be upfront and honest about what you need from these people and what you plan to use. Ask them what they are comfortable
with from the beginning. Don’t get into the late stages of your reporting process to discover a family member isn’t comfortable
going public with vital information or a worker doesn’t want to participate.

Sources: reporting with long-term care facility employees
-

If the person is currently employed, make sure they understand the consequences of going public about problems. If they
want anonymity, vet their employment and confirm they are legit. (ask to see a copy of a pay stub, nursing license, picture of
ID, etc. Also ask detailed questions about the facility’s interior and operations, such as signage and layout that only an
employee could know, and confirm those details with other employees)

Quick Tips
●
●
●
●

●
●

●

Obituaries – locate family members
SEC filings – find corporate salaries (10-K) and major company news (8-K)
FOIA log – Peek in on news outlets, lawyers, vendors and advocacy groups
Email advice
○ Copy the bosses (spokespeople become a lot faster when the CEO is CCd)
○ Hunter.io (look up the CEO, CFO, etc. and replicate the email styling)
Infogram – Use premade charts and graphics, just change the numbers and text
Google Maps
○ insert column and create an full address from separate cells with the following formula:
○ =D2&", "&E2&", "&F2&", "&G2
○ D2 is address field, E2 is city field, F2 is state field, G2 is zip code field
Lawsuits
○ PACER
○ Local district and county courts
○ Call the plaintiff’s attorneys
