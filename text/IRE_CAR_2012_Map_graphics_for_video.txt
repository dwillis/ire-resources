SOFTWARE
Unfortunately, to do
high-quality video effects, you’ll
need to spend some money.

Video editor (always needed)
• iMovie (Included with Mac OSX)
–If you have to, but limited control

• Final Cut Pro ($300)
–Price jump from iMovie, but cheaper than it used to be
–Fairly intuitive, but a price jump from iMovie
–Beware the new version (Final Cut Pro X)

•Avid Studio ($170)
–More common in broadcast newsrooms/Gannett
–Less intuitive – not sure easy to learn on your own

•Adobe Premiere (Part of $1,700 package, $800 standalone)
–Everything old is new again – has buzz with the cool kids

•Blender (Free)
–Designed for 3D, but has a non-linear editor built in

Google Earth Pro
• $400/year
• Export HD movies with good photo imagery
• Anything you put in KML format can be an overlay
• Not as much control over movement as you'd like
• Will have to do some overlay work in video editor, Photoshop or
After Effects
• Will always look like Google
–Don’t forget to keep the credit in there

Google Earth Pro example

Adobe After Effects
• $999 to buy, ~$50/month to rent
• Front-line video effects software for broadcast
• Lots of control over output
• Ability to import vector imagery, lots of Photoshop stuff
• Has decent 3D

After Effects example

Apple Motion
• $50(!!!) A pretty great deal
• Not as linear as After Effects
• More organic: Set up physics, let world run itself
• Has decent 3D (can’t import 3D objects)

Cinema 4D
• Expensive ($3,000+, if you have to ask …)
• Premium 3D software for broadcast
–Often used for title packages at networks, etc.

• Great for modeling, texturing
• Can do highly accurate 3D terrain
•Does more than most of us will ever need

Cinema 4D/After Effects example

Open-source options
• Jahshaka
–Meant as open-source After Effects
–Not ready for prime time, maybe new version

Open-source options

• Blender
–100% free!
–Fully featured 3D AND a nonlinear video editor
–Sometimes a little more granola than Cinema 4D
–Interface is more difficult to learn
–Like QGIS: blink and it has gotten better
–Lots of great tutorials and community support

Blender example (quickish)

Adobe Illustrator
• Vector is your friend in video
• Useful for lining geometries up, testing colors
• Very useful for passing spatial information to After
Effects (more on that in a bit)

Other useful software
● Adobe Photoshop
● Quantum GIS
● Mapnik

Yikes! How do I get software cheaper?
• Educational discount?
• Nonprofit discount?
• Does a broadcast partner have a machine you can
borrow?
• Local university or tech college with a broadcast dept.?
• Is renting worthwhile for your situation?

WELCOME
TO VIDEO
There's some things
you should know.

Plan before you start working
• How does this fit into the rest of the video?
– Audio matching
• Makes a big difference between pro and amateurseeming
• Record audio track first, match animation to final track
– By necessity, video effects are finalized late in the
process
• Don’t surprise your producer!

Mis en place
• From cooking: “Everything in place”
• What data do I need to make sure I have beforehand?
• What technical format is the video?
—Never start without knowing your destination format, and
always work in that final format (exception: It's for web, but you
might want to broadcast later)

Video technical specs
• Choose your own adventure
–Video for the web?
• Congratulations, your life just got much easier
–Video for broadcast?
• Take a deep breath

Video technical specs

• Aspect ratio: 16:9 or 4:3?

Broadcast tech specs: NTSC

• NTSC
–Old-school 4:3 video, 720x480 pixel resolution
–Anamorphic (pixels that aren’t actually square)

Broadcast tech specs: HD (but which?)

Broadcast tech specs: Interlacing
● Interlaced video shows smoother motion
● Less sharpness
● If they want it interlaced, ask which field first (They'll
say upper/lower or odd/even)
Not interlaced (progressive)

Interlaced

Broadcast tech specs: Title-safe area

Yes, you do have to (sorry)

Broadcast tech specs: Color and sound
There are FCC standards for the minimum and maximum color
and audio levels you can legally use.
Get a pro to do this for you.

Web technical specs
● Balancing size, speed and quality
● Be aware of limits of web video
● Preview text at the size it will be viewed

Aesthetic considerations: Color
● Can the viewer read everything they need to read?
● Are any colors distracting attention from something
important?

Aesthetic considerations: Texture
Adding terrain or some other texture is an unobtrusive way to
make the effect more professional, look like it's fully done.

VS.

Aesthetic considerations: Type sizes
Think about where your viewers will be watching your video.
For Web, be careful below 40px font.

STEP-BY-STEP
Now comes the actual mappy part.

First: What do you want it to look like?

• Goals
–Be visually pleasing
–Be accurate!
–Move story along

1. Plan before you start working
• Storyboard your map effect with your video
editor/video producer

2. Data mis en place - shopping list
● Imagery of nuclear plant:
○ Aerial photography? NAIP or DOQ (Earth Explorer)
○ Terrain? SRTM (Earth Explorer)
○ How much resolution do I need for closest I want to
show?
● Detailed cutout shapefile for California shoreline
○ Try National Atlas
● Coordinates of anything you'll be layering on top
○ In this case, fault line vector shapefiles from USGS
○ More coordinates specific to story from a source

3. Build a master spatial file
● 1st ask yourself: Do I need real GIS functionality?
○ If you're just placing a city or a few markers on a map at
the state level, you can just as quickly do this right in
your effects program
● If it's more complex, I start with a project in QGIS
○ Allows you to easily combine vector and raster imagery
○ Can do some color testing
○ Can see quickly if all data is in the right projection
● Reprojecting
○ Vector: QGIS or PostGIS
○ Raster: GDAL (QGIS plugins available)

What if I don't have good spatial data?
● Vector
○ indiemapper
■ Several good projections
■ Choose pre-built geometries or import your own
○ Census (TIGER data)
○ Natural Earth
● Raster
○ USGS Earth Explorer
■ Bulk downloader, many datasets
○ Natural Earth

What is the right projection, anyway?
2D effects
● Depends on scale
○ Local or smaller states: Nearest UTM
■ Especially important if you want to show a circular
radius around something
○ Regional/National: U.S. National Atlas Equal Area (SRID
2163)
○ Global: Try Robinson
3D effects: Good 'ol SRID 4326 (WGS 84)

Working with raster data
● GDAL is your friend. Incredibly powerful, incredibly free.
○ Most raster data is in tiled format, so you'll need GDAL
to stitch stuff together and re-project
○ Can use shapefile to cutout precise boundaries for
isolating states, etc.
● Build in time for downloading, data processing
● Optimize for how much/how little data you need
○ How high-rez do you need? Adds to time
required exponentially
○ Make yourself reusable imagery for common tasks

4. Move from GIS to graphics format
● You can't directly import GIS data in After Effects
○ Upload vectors to indiemapper, export a layered SVG

5. From Illustrator to After Effects
● Open layered SVG in Illustrator
○ Release clipping masks if you want to see whole
geometries
○ "Release to layers" in layer flyout menu so you can work
with one layer at a time in After Effects
○ Make sure all layers you want access to are on top level
● Save as .AI
● Import inside After Effects project as "Composition"
○ Be sure to check "Continuously rasterize" in layers
○ Turn on motion blur before final rendering

Tips for After Effects
● If you want to animate paths themselves, you'll need to
paste them in from Illustrator separately
○ Use your imported .AI as reference for lining up

● Parent all your shape layers to one layer, control
scale/position with that
● Move transform point to the center of your action
● Paste as paths, not masks for familiarity's sake
● If you're adding raster imagery, have an Illustrator layer with
vector outline, line up inside After Effects
● Don't forget to factor in render time
● Avoid images over 10,000 pixels wide or tall: AE will freak

More After Effects tips
● Make layers 3D, add a light for more interest
● A circular vignette effect adds a little drama

3D with a light

6. Render to file, deliver to editor
● Render video in your destination format
● Hand over the file
● Wait for edits (oh, there will be edits)

Final sample animation

Other workflows to consider
● Google Earth with KML overlays
> Photoshop for titles
> video editor
● Mapnik - Do separate render with same BBox for each layer
you want to fade in
> Change sizes/opacity in video editor
