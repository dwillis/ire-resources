Watchdogging local
government:
It’s lonely and often boring. But
occasionally rewarding.

Contracting: the straw
that stirs the drink
• What’s this mean for reporters? Keep an eye on
contracts. How?
• Sourcing: Best stories usually start w/ tip
• http://www.publicnoticeads.com/LA/
• Local government websites
• Hard copies of newspapers
• Blogs:

1_archive.html
• Your competitors (obviously); Google alerts

Rules of engagement
• The LA public bid law:

0Bid%20Law%20%2808-2013%29.pdf
• Also useful: state ethics code:
http://ethics.la.gov/Pub/Laws/ethsum.pdf
• Local rules, too

Professional service or public bid?
• Depends on type of work and the cost
• State law applies; often there are
additional local gov’t rules
• So-called “professional services” – legal,
architectural, engineering, tech, etc. – do
not have to go to the low bidder
• Rationale: You don’t necessarily want the
cheapest lawyer

What must be bid?
• Buildings, supplies over a certain $
threshold, etc. Generally items that meet
certain specs – theoretically making it
irrelevant who provides them.
• Harder to rig or steer these contracts. Bids
must be delivered sealed and opened
publicly. But not impossible
• The change-order racket

Why professional services?
• Much easier to steer to friends – or crooks.
• Criteria are inherently subjective
• The nature of the service is often difficult
for public (or media) to value

What to look for
• Changes in vendors, especially after
political turnover
• What are the big-money contracts?
(Garbage hauling, energy efficiency)
• Is the government privatizing a service
that had been done in-house?
• Mutual back-scratching (Bill Hubbard-Tim
Whitmer; FQ parking)

Campaign contributions
• Yes, they’re legal, but they often hint at close
(and sometimes inappropriately close)
relationships
• The state’s database:

earch/SearchEfilingContributors.aspx
• The T-P/Fox 8 database:

Campaign contribs cont.
• TP/Fox list of 400 largest donors:
http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/11/lo
uisianas_top_400_political_c.html
• Don’t just rely on these: Look at the actual lists.
You’ll find other stuff, like: how important is this
donor to this pol?
• Other clues, like have other people from the firm
donated?
• Don’t forget to look at disclosures:

Subcontracts: hidden treasure
• The bad stuff is often buried in
subcontracts.
• They’re hard (sometimes impossible) to
find; only official relationship is between
the city and the prime contractor.
• Sometimes companies must list subs,
either because the sub has a particular
expertise or because the sub is helping
meet a DBE goal.

Some examples
• City Hall energy efficiency contract:
