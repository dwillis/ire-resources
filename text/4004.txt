Geographic Coordinates
 0° (Degree) Latitude  Equator
 0° (Degree) Longitude  Greenwich (GB)

 Ottawa: 45°N, 75°W

NEVER MEASURE IN DEGREES!!

Map Projections
 Method to represent the
surface of a sphere(3D)
on a plane (2D)


Coordinates are now in
measurement units like
meters, km, feet, miles,…
