TIP # 1
A PRELIMINARY CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION IN ITALY IS RUN BY A PROSECUTOR.
AN ARREST WARRANT IS REQUESTED BY A PROSECUTOR TO THE JUDGE OF THE
PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIONS, WHO MAY SIGN OR REJECT IT. ONCE THEIR
CLIENTS ARE ARRESTED, ONLY APPOINTED DEFENSE LAWYERS ARE ENTITLED TO
GET A TEXT OF THAT WARRANT, OUTLINING THE CHARGES .
A WARRANT, AS USUALLY HAPPENS, REPORTS TRANSCRIPTS OF SUSPECT
INTERCEPTS, BUT REMAINS IN THE HANDS OF A LAWYER. THE MAIN PROBLEM IS
HOW TO GET HOLD OF THESE PAPERS. CONTACTING LAWYERS MAY BE A FAST
TRACK TO GET SOMETHING.
A PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION MAY LAST 6 MONTHS, BUT THIS COULD BE
FURTHER DELAYED, NOT INCLUDING EXTENSIONS WHICH COULD DRAG OUT 2
YEARS, BUT ONLY FOR MAJOR INVESTIGATIONS. DURING THIS TIME NOBODY IS
ALLOWED TO GET NEW JUDICIAL DOCUMENTS, NOT EVEN DEFENSE LAWYERS.
AT THE END OF THIS TIME THE PROSECUTOR WRAPS UP HIS INVESTIGATION AND
HANDS OVER HIS DOCUMENTATION TO THE JUDGE OF THE PRELIMINARY
INVESTIGATIONS, ASKING HIM TO PUT THE INDICTED PERSONS ON TRIAL.
THE JUDGE MAY DECIDES IN TWO WAYS:
1. HE AGREES: A TRIAL TAKES PLACE IN A COURT BEFORE ANOTHER JUDGE
ENDING UP IN A CONVICTION OR IN AN ACQUITTAL.
2. HE DISAGREES:
THE INDICTED PERSONS WILL BE IMMEDIATELY
ACQUITTED.
WHEN, ACCORDING TO THE DECISION OF THE JUDGE OF THE PRELIMINARY
INVESTIGATIONS, INDICTED PEOPLE STAND TRIAL, BEFORE HEARING BEGUIN,
LAWYERS WILL BE ENTITLED TO GET ALL NEW DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING NEW
TRANSCRIPTS OF INTERCEPTS.

TIP # 2
ALL HEARINGS OF A TRIAL ARE PUBLIC AND THEIR TRANSCRIPTS ARE
AVAILABLE FOR DEFENSE LAWYERS. IN SOME CASES, UPON WRITTEN REQUESTS,
JOURNALISTS MAY ASK THE JUDGE FOR TEXTS OF THE TRANSCRIPS WHILE A
TRIAL IS STILL UNDER WAY. BUT A POSITIVE ANSWER IS AT JUDGE'S DISCRETION.
WHEN A JUDGE ISSUES HIS FIRST RULING, FROM THAT TIME THE COURT RECORD
IS A REAL PUBLIC RECORD. EVERY CITIZEN IS ENTITLED TO GET A COPY UPON
REQUEST TO THE JUDGE WHO HEARD THE CASE. BUT THIS TAKES WEEKS,
ESPECIALLY IN COMPLICATED CASES.
DEFENSE LAWYERS MAY BE A FASTER TRACK TO GET JUDICIAL PAPERS.

TIP # 3
BEFORE THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACK, ANTITERRORISM LAWS IN ITALY DIDN'T
PROVIDE ANY PENALTY FOR THE CRIME OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, WHICH
IS COMMITTED WHEN SOMEBODY PERFORMS ACTIONS BEYOND THE BORDER OF
ITALY.
ONLY IN OCTOBER 2001 THE ROME PARLIAMENT PASSED A NEW LAW WHICH
PROHIBITS ACTS PERFORMED BY PEOPLE CONSPIRING OUTSIDE ITALY.
BEFORE THAT DATE BIN LADEN'S ASSOCIATES IN ITALY WERE CONVICTED FOR
MINOR CRIMES (SUCH AS CRIMINAL
ASSOCIATION, PRODUCING FALSE
DOCUMENTS, FAVOURING THE ENTRY OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS INTO ITALY),
COMMITTED BEFORE THAT LAW WAS ENACTED.
NOW TERRORISTS CONVICTED FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM FACE MORE
SERIOUS PENALTIES, INCLUDING PUNISHMENTS FORMERLY RESERVED TO MAFIA
BOSSES WHILE THEY ARE IN JAIL.
