100% Free and Open Source

Coming Summer 2011

OpenBlock is Open Source Software, meaning that it can be
downloaded and installed for free (under the GPL license).
It leverages several other open-source technologies such as
Django, PostGIS, OpenLayers and Python.

OpenBlock is currently under development, with a public
release planned for Summer 2011. Join the open source
community and follow our progress at
http://developer.openblockproject.org.

OpenBlock is produced by OpenPlans in conjunction with the Boston Globe and the Columbia Daily Tribune,
with generous support from the Knight Foundation.

For more information, visit openblockproject.org
or contact Frank Hebbert, frank@openplans.org, 720 432-2378.

* Finding or providing data sources in your region is part of setting up OpenBlock. While OpenBlock will ship with some default data sets,
sourcing data in your community will be required.
