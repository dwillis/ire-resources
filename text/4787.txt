How to turn your investigation into a podcast
Gina Barton, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel / Unsolved Podcast
1. Consider investing $129 in the iZotope Rx plugin package to quickly clean up audio files,
removing clicks, background noise, loud breathing, etc.
2. Work backwards. Consider building your script around audio you have gathered for your print
reporting.
3. Just talk. When recording voiceover, talk off the cuff about the topic or answer a question rather
than reading or reciting lines from a script. This helps convey your enthusiasm as well as helping
you to sound natural rather than scripted.
4. Seek out archival audio. Old television or radio clips can help keep the podcast interesting.
5. Seek out police audio. In many states, police are required to record interrogations. Even in
states where it’s not required, they often do. These audio recordings are public records and can
be requested via the freedom of information act or the state open records law.
6. Recruit people in your newsroom as voiceover “actors.” If you have corresponded with someone
in prison, for example, but aren’t allowed to bring a recorder inside, you can ask a colleague to
read the letters – or parts of them – aloud for use on the podcast. Of course, let listeners know
that’s what you’re doing.
7. Plan the narrative arc, both of each episode and of the entire show. As in print serial narratives,
cliffhangers help bring the audience back for more.
8. Consider joining AIR - the Association of Independents in Radio - to ask the experts for advice on
producing your show and finding ways to distribute it to your intended audience.
