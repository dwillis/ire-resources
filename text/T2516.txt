The Savvy Reporter: Tips for Covering the Environment
A good environment reporter is part student, part sleuth. Many topics on the
beat, like water quality regulation or energy development, have both scientific and
bureaucratic terms and processes that must be mastered.
• A background in science or a related field helps.
• Make friends with academics who can help you master terms, issues.
• Ask for primary source material, like published scientific papers.
• Check what you think the data is telling you with experts.
• Always make the extra phone call. Over-report.
• Expect to be overwhelmed.
Databases: Databases can be frightening thickets of indecipherable codes and
numbers, but they can help you formulate questions and provide answers that a
target agency may be reluctant to provide without a heaping spoonful of spin.
• When making FOIA requests, first find out how data is collected and how
it is maintained to maximize your success in obtaining documents.
• Ask for information in electronic form.
• Query your database early and often.
• Use the database as a foundation for your story; flesh out what’s at stake
with standard reporting.
• Check and recheck to make sure your conclusions are right.
Sources: In the last several years, many state and federal agencies have become
more aggressive in denying open records requests. Solid sourcing can be an
effective to circumvent the censors.
• Agency meetings are boring. Go anyway. Face time with agency staffers
can be a critical door opener.
• Every agency has at least one employee with a conscience. Find them.
• Recent retirees know where the skeletons are.
• Never, ever burn a source.
Converting your biggest critic: Your editor.
Many editors don’t like environmental stories because they are often tough
to shove into the inverted pyramid format. Improve your success with these tips:
• Hunt down jargon and kill it.
• Present what’s at stake up high.
• Find the person caught in the middle. Enter the story through his or her
eyes
