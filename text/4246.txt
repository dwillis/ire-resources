Reducing Federal Loan Eligibility Would Hurt Students at For-Profit Colleges
: Some for-profit college industry lobbyists blame students for the high debt and
default levels at their schools, claiming that their students borrow more than they
need in federal loans. This fact sheet shows there’s no evidence to support this
claim, and giving colleges greater authority to reduce aid eligibility will make it
harder for students to pay for and complete college.
IBRinfo.org: provides reliable consumer-oriented information about incomedriven repayment plans and Public Service Loan Forgiveness, federal programs
that can help make student loan repayment more manageable. Includes a
handy table that explains the main features of the four income-driven plans.
studentloanborrowerassistance.org: The National Consumer Law Center’s
online resource for borrowers trying to figure out their options, especially those
who may already be struggling with repayment. Also includes research and
media materials from NCLC’s Student Loan Borrower Assistance Project.

America’s colleges and universities are quietly shifting
the burden of tuition increases onto low-income
students. Yet many wealthy families are seeing their
costs rise more slowly, or even fall, an analysis of federal
data shows.
The trend could further widen the gap between the
nation’s rich and poor, say financial aid experts and a
growing number of university leaders. They worry about
college degrees drifting beyond the economic reach of
many students.
