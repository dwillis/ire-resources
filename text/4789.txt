the story

Starting out

Have a plan
Take the time to determine the
steps needed before you start
What documents/data?
Who will you talk to?
Who can confirm/poke holes
in your methods?

Keeping track of the
details can save
time in the end

Know your data and documents
Where did they come
from?
Who keeps them?
How are they used and
why were they created?

If the data are
wrong, your story is
wrong.

Study up!
Who has done this story
before?
Check :
Google/ Google scholar
clips
Lawsuits
Research journals

Find Experts

• Find the data geeks, especially if they are associated with
the FOIA office of the agency
• Find outside experts who use/understand the data

• Consider other subject or method experts – social or data
scientists who can suggest well-known methods

As you go

A good investigative story is
an argument, not a question
Build your case
carefully, and make
sure you can explain
it clearly. Display
mastery.

Bias: Empathy for the bad guys?

Don’t wait to confront subjects

Let them know early; update them when necessary
Their comments may change the story, but what
doesn’t kill it makes it stronger
And multiple interviews may help you realize bias

Track your work
• Track your project – update it as you
go
• Track your analysis – use a repository
doc. Make sure it can be replicated!

• Track your subjects – Who do you
call? How often?
• Track your time – what’s the true timecost? (you can keep this to yourself!)

The Reveal

Get a new
perspective
Create a ‘red team’
Have a trusted first reader
If there’s data, show it to
someone else.

Transparency
Show your work!
Post documents on Document Cloud or website (annotate!)

Enlist someone to read docs -- make sure there are no Social
Security numbers, home addresses, reporter notes, etc.
If you use data, write a separate story explaining the
methodology. Best case: write a white paper

No surprises
• Never surprise the people in your story. They should know the conclusions
• Give them plenty of time to respond. Never assume they are aware of the
alleged wrongdoing. It may require some checking.
• Consider sharing the docs or data with the subject; at least the
methodology
• Check every fact – name, date, number, titles
• Check every characterization – were you fair?

Landmines
Watch your language
 “Failed”
 “Conspired”
 Starting a lot of sentences

with “but”

 Superlatives such as

“biggest”, “most” etc. Make
sure you can back it up.

Watch last minute stuff:
 Teasers

 Photo Credits

 Subheads

 Graphics

 Promo copy
 Cutlines
 Headlines
 Map labels

Cover
Reporting isn’t private –often it’s the most innocuous thing that can
haunt you later:
•
•
•
•
•

Emails
• Drafts
Texts
• Notes
Tweets
• Voicemails
Notes
Graphics/charts

A few case studies

“ Is there another way I can check
these numbers?

”

Ask yourself: is there another data set, or even anecdotal
evidence, that this could be right? Start this even before you
begin reporting.

Centers for
Disease Control
National Vital
Statistics, 2013

Be suspicious of your own story

Ask yourself (or someone else): can this possibly be true?

“

Is my premise right?

”
Ask yourself: Is it perfect? Reasonably good? Or get-it-done? All have their
place, but be honest with audience about which one it is.

A word about science stories…

Bulletproofing science stories


Check units – parts per million vs. parts per billion



Verify all conversions – Celsius/Fahrenheit, miles/kilometers, etc.



Consider describing a scientists job title, or give discipline specifics



Careful with language and concepts that have different meanings to
the general public – like uncertainty, theory and model
