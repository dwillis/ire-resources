So you want to find
someone far away…

TWO QUESTIONS:
Who are you looking for?
ØA source?
ØSomeone in particular?
Why do you want to find him/her/it?
ØTo ask questions?
ØEstablish links with someone else?
ØEnter their world?

MOTIVATION COUNTS
If you’re looking for someone who
doesn’t want to be found, they won’t
like it.
If you’re looking for someone who
thinks you can hurt them or someone
they love, they won’t like it.

The Problem: Find someone who
can make me a fake passport
You can’t ask for this on the street.
But you can look in Google Groups
to see if anyone had the idea….

http://www.google.com/

That’s a good start. Now we have to:
Ø Decide how to present ourselves. As a
reporter? A client? I say as a reporter. If
you lie and you’re caught, you can’t go
back.
ØSolution: Use a pseudo, but announce
what you’re there for. Result: Legit ID
makers became sources; in the end, a
criminal who first told me to buzz off
came around when he learned I worked
for a magazine he loves.

New Problem: Track Forgers of Cuban Art
Solution (1): Start with the victims for leads
In this case, victims were the heirs of Cuban
artist Wifredo Lam. They provided
documentation of fakes from which I could
draw a pattern.
All roads led to Miami. Research in art
books and revues turned up names of
prominent dealers who led me to major
collectors and scholars….

Cuban Art (2): Widening the leads
A criminal case in which a dealer testified
turned up in a newspaper DB. The accused
had vanished, but the Miami prosecutor
gave me details of the case. So I now had a
name I could use.
The collectors and scholars led to further
documents, suggesting involvement of
Cuban officials – no names, but clear
trails….

Cuban Art (3): Deepening Contacts
As sources realized I was serious, they
provided deeper info. That sent me back to a
sale in which Christie’s withdrew many
paintings…. and to the wife of one artist
involved, who had signed the certificates.
Results: The Cuban government denied
involvement of its officials but admitted for
the first time that fakes originating in Cuba
had compromised the market. See the story:

Key Principles So Far:
ØCriminal activity takes place in
a specific milieu. To get
information, you must be in
contact with the milieu.
ØStart with victims to find
wrongdoers. Take the time
needed to prove your good faith.

New Problem: I’m Gonna Lose
My Job If I Can’t Do This…
My boss says to me: « Doctors are
killing prematurely-born,
handicapped babies. Prove it. »
Ever meet one of those doctors?
Me neither. Do they advertise on
the Net? No. Goodbye, job.

But I Like the Job. So Instead….
Take the assignment as a
hypothesis that can be proven or
disproven.
Decompose each element into a
form that can be separately
verified:

Doctors (but which doctors? What
specialty?)…
Answer: Search medical lit DBs with
keywords « premature birth »
Are killing prematurely-born babies
(how many? Out of how many born
each year?)
Answer: Check natality stats in library
or online.

First results:
Publicly available data show that until 1982,
premature births in the US steadily declined.
After 1982, they skyrocketed.
So either our killers gave up or they have
been unable to stem the tide.
Meanwhile, we know who our specialists are:
Neo-natologists. And we have a half-dozen
articles from the library’s medical lit DB….

The Wonders of Scientific Literature
Scientific literature undergoes peer review.
So it is more solid than your average
editorial.
It is catalogued in open sources. Any
competent librairian can help you find it.
(Say thanks!)
And it has the institutional address of the
author(s). So you just found an expert
source.

What the Medical Researchers Told Me
One of the articles contained a reference to
the « Baby Doe Laws ». They were passed
in 1982 – does that year ring a bell?
They required physicians to use all possible
means to « save » prematurely-born babies –
even if horrendous handicaps resulted.
They were enforced with hotlines in every
hospital, and those hotlines were used.

Now I Went Back to My Boss….
I said: « In 1982, Congress passed a law that
required doctors to keep babies alive who
would otherwise die. That was 15 years ago.
Today there are a quarter-million of those
kids who survived – and they are terribly
handicapped.
But that’s not the worst of it, boss. Congress
just took away their Social Security. Do you
want this story?»

Solving the Civilian Problem
I could find the doctors. I could find the
statistics. But where do you find parents of
these kids? Two answers from the Internet:
ØSeek for parents for write or militate on
these issues, through handicapped support
groups of e-zines.
ØSeek mailing lists (-L) of parents through
search engines, and get on the list.

How We Found the « Baby Killers »
Months into the story, sources in the Rightto-Life movement tipped me off to a medical
article I had missed, in which a San
Francisco hospital admitted that it withheld
care from borderline newborns. The author
was facing a Congressional inquiry. We
interviewed him for our series.
My boss personally rewrote the story, calling
the author a hero. Other physicians admitted
to us that they did the same.

Results
« Super-Preemies: The Miracle and the
Shame » ran as a four-part, 13-story series
in The American in Nov. 1997. The entire
series was picked up on the Knight-Ridder
wire. In 1998 it won two national awards.
But the Baby Doe laws are still on the
books. And someday a reporter without
scruples may hang some of my sources.

The Message in Review:
Sources will hear you coming. So do two
things first:
ØGet everything you can from the public
record before you call anyone.
ØMake sure you can give them a good
reason to talk to you. Sources know when
you have a closed mind. They can also tell
when you’re lying. If you want their secrets,
be trustworthy.
