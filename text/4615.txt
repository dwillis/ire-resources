LEGISLATION – www.congress.gov provides full text access to current bills in
the U.S. House and Senate, the U.S. Code, Congressional Record, and more.
Www.GovTrack.us is a free legislative tracking tool and the data source for many other
congressional transparency websites. It appears to use Library of Congress information
and repackages it on a searchable site. GovTrack.us centralizes information on the
legislative process into a Web site that can be searched. The Washington Post has a
database of all congressional votes: http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/114/
LOBBYING. Find lobbying reports at
www.senate.gov/legislative/Public_Disclosure/LDA_reports.htm. Search the
Lobbying Database contains reports filed on amounts of money paid to lobbyists, the
issues on which they lobbied, sometimes the agencies they lobbied and who hired them.
Lobbyists also must report campaign contributions or donations made to charities on
behalf of members of Congress.
DOJ’s Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) web site can provide information
on the names of lobbyists for foreign entities. www.fara.gov Also, the Sunlight
Foundation has a tool to help track this federal data; it can be found at
http://foreign.influenceexplorer.com/ and is based on FARA reports, but is
easier to search. Best to often use both sources in tandem.
The Center for Responsive Politics maintains the comprehensive go-to lobbyist database:
www.opensecrets.org/lobbyists/index.php. The pay rival includes FEE-based service
CQ Moneyline, http://moneyline.cq.com/ and http://www.legistorm.com/
Washington Representatives, which also has a web site, www.lobbyists.info offers an
up-to-date site of registered lobbyists. Lacks historical data. Paid site but offers free trials.
Often includes more complete than SOPR because they fact-check Senate filings.
CONTRACTING. The Project On Government Oversight (POGO) tracks
misconduct on the top 100 contractors: www.contractormisconduct.org.
Also, the Federal Contracts Database is sold by IRE. You can search for federal
contracts awarded to a particular business: a great place to start when looking at contracts
awarded to companies in your area, or work being performed there. You can also search
all contracts at a new government site, http://usaspending.gov.
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 required that a website created to
"foster greater accountability and transparency in the use of funds made available in this
Act.” www.Recovery.gov tools to track Recovery funds. It folds later in 2015.

GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS -- Government Attic -http://governmentattic.org/ A project of a FOIA fanatic, government attic posts FOIA
logs and hundreds of documents FOIA’d.
Biased interest groups: Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW)
(http://citizensforethics.org/) – is a liberal interest group that has an online, searchable
compendium of documents acquired from government agencies
http://www.scribd.com/citizensforethics Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in
Washington (CREW) has thousands of documents responsive to many Freedom of
Information Act (FOIA) requests from GovernmentDogs.org on Scribd.com. Look up the
congressional correspondence logs, which Sunlight Foundation started acquiring from
federal agencies in 2008.
Judicial Watch is a conservative group that has documents FOIA’d and available in a
searchable ford.
http://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/category/foia-request/
EARMARKS. Taxpayers for Common Sense, www.taxpayer.net, has a wellearned reputation for tracking earmarks. You can download their full detailed excel
spreadsheets, which lists the earmarks in all appropriations and authorization bills and
includes the Congressional sponsor for each earmark, the amount and the recipient.
TRADE PRESS AND NEWSLETTERS. Most industries have a trade
magazine, newspaper or newsletter covering them and the regulators that regulate them.
Many of these can be found on Nexis or Factiva sites, or are kept in agency libraries.
PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS. Nearly every industry has a trade group or
professional association, often based in Washington and state capitals, to represent the
industry’s interests. Find the group and get their publications. Many are online.
LAWSUITS. Key documents to find a company’s disputes with creditors,
employees, rivals, etc. Can be windows into a company. Find disgruntled ex-workers.
COMPANY OFFICIALS. The company’s public affairs officers and public
officials. Outside public affairs officials who represent the company. Use discretion
depending on the angle of the story. If you can’t reach them at work, you can call them at
home. Get company official names from web sites and from SEC (see below). Also,
Leadership Directories, publisher of government “Yellow Books,” public executive
listings. The web site is http://ldi.bvdep.com and lists the executives at every
company. It's expensive but worth it if you can afford it.
FORMER EMPLOYEES AND RIVALS. Employees who have sued the
company, though they have an ax to grind, can often provide inside information. Check
lawsuits, get internal directories, get names off web sites and Google searches.
LABOR UNIONS. Often know more about a company than the company
officials, where the bodies are buried. But they also sometimes have an interest to keep
the secrets secret. Union officials can put you in touch with employees.
REGULATORS. Rule-making, fines, citations, policy agendas -- often
everything important runs through the federal, state and local agencies that regulate
industries. Check rule dockets, warning letters, enforcement actions, file public-record
requests for meetings with officials. e.g., EPA, USDA, OSHA. EPA dockets are found at
the rulemaking “gateway” -- http://yosemite.epa.gov/opei/RuleGate.nsf/
ACCESS TO THE WHITE HOUSE. Records of White House visitors can be
found here.

http://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/disclosures/visitor-records. The Office of
Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA, pronounced "oh-eye-ruh") was established
by Congress in 1980 to review information collected by the federal government on
rulemaking. It develops and oversees policies and reviews draft regulations . Lobbyists
often try to influence the process here. OIRA discloses basic information from meeting,
oral and written communications. Those can be found here:
http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/oira_default. A group of lawyers called the Center for
Progressive Reform has taken this data and put it into a more searchable Web site.
Unfortunately, it only is the meetings and not the other communications – and only
through 2011. http://www.progressivereform.org/OIRA-data.cfm
LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEES. Find out which legislative and congressional
committees have jurisdiction over the industry. Look at legislation, appropriation bills,
hearing reports, investigative reports. FOIA lawmaker correspondence with regulatory
agencies.
NON-PROFITS. Many lawmakers have close affiliations with nonprofits. The
990 tax forms for tax-exempt, nonprofit organizations are available on Guidestar at
www.guidestar.org. Free copies of millions of Form 990s can be found on the personal
Web site of Luke Rosiak, citizenaudit.org. Guidestar’s arrival in many ways superseded
the widely used California AG’s Registry of Charitable Trusts site at
http://caag.state.ca.us/charities/. It is still good at some of the harder-to-find stuff.
The Foundation Center www.fdncenter.org has tax returns and financial info on
charities/trusts. Click on Foundation Finder, http://lnp.fdncenter.org/finder.html,
which has details and tax returns on 70,000 private and community foundations, or to the
990 search engine, http://lnp.fdncenter.org/finder_990.html Economic Research
Institute for nonprofit searching; has nonprofit executive pay searching: http://www.erinonprofit-salaries.com/index.cfm?FuseAction=NPO.Search
LAW FIRMS AND LAWYERS. For a nationwide search, try MartindaleHubbell at www.martindale.com. Lawyers pay to be listed in Martindale.
FOLLOW THE MONEY
CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS. Track federal campaign contributions by
individual, company or industry at www.opensecrets.org, the Web site of the Center
for Responsive Politics. CRP codes donations to make them more accessible than they
are on the Federal Election Commission site, www.fec.gov. Another site,
http://moneyline.cq.com requires paid registration. Selected state information at The
Institute on Money in State Politics http://www.followthemoney.org/ The Campaign
Finance Institute provides statistics and historical campaign finance information.
http://www.cfinst.org/
FUND RAISERS–Sunlight Foundation created Party Time
http://politicalpartytime.org is a crowd-sourced project to track parties for members of
Congress or congressional candidates that happen all year round in Washington, D.C. and
beyond. Sources send invitations involving members of Congress to Party Time, but
since this is all voluntary, the information contained in this database is by no means
complete. Searchable by member, committee, etc. Other Sunlight tools for tracking
lawmakers is here: http://sunlightfoundation.com/tools/

Another service tracking parties, including political fundraisers, is
http://guestofaguest.com/ which was founded by Cameron Winklevoss, one of the
brothers who famously sued Mark Zuckerberg for stealing the idea of Facebook.
Guestofaguest is a database of parties with calendar and photos designed for the social
scene.
527 Groups - IRS Data. The IRS has made the disclosures filed by section 527
organizations—the independent political committees that can raise money in unlimited
amounts from any source—searchable, albeit with a cranky, complicated, squint-inducing
interface. You get raw data from the search, but right now it’s the best thing going on
527s. The data is available here:
http://forms.irs.gov/politicalOrgsSearch/search/gotoBasicSearch.action
http://forms.irs.gov/politicalOrgsSearch/search/gotoAdvanced8871Search.a
ction
PRIVATELY FUNDED CONGRESSIONAL TRIPS, FINANCIAL
DISCLOSURES, STAFFER SALARIES. The Center for Responsive Politics has a link
on site to estimate members personal wealth.
http://www.opensecrets.org/pfds/overview.php
Also, the very useful Web site, http://www.legistorm.com/ has information on
congressional trips, the raw financial disclosure forms and congressional staffer salaries.
Legistorm pretty much took over where others left off, such as the Center for Public
Integrity which had Medill’s database of trips from 2005 and updated it a few years ago
(but not lately): http://www.publicintegrity.org/powertrips/.
TRIPS. Reports of certain expenditures for all official foreign travel by Members and
staff of the U.S. House of Representatives are filed publicly under law. Reports from
1994 through the current quarter are printed in the Congressional Record and can be
searched here: http://clerk.house.gov/public_disc/foreign/index.aspx
Lawmakers trips found on CQ PoliticalMoneyLine, http://moneyline.cq.com –
formerly www.fecinfo.com – also has analyzed privately funded travel from 2000 to
2006 as disclosed by members and senators.
