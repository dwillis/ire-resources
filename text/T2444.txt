Reporting on Property and Housing Issues

PROPERTY:
Every reporter knows the tried-and-true advice: Follow the money. But I would
expand that advice: Follow the money AND the PROPERTY.
 Determine what sort of access you have to property records. Usually kept
by counties, the records may be available only at the courthouse. But
more commonly they are being made available to the public via the
internet. Some counties are charging for access, which is troubling. But
many offer free and easy access.
 Get some local legal advice on how your state handles property
transactions. Are deeds of trust filed for mortgages and warranty deeds for
sales of property. What does a quit-claim do?
 Find out if property tax and other tax records (personal property or local
occupational or business taxes) are available. In most states, such tax
information is open. If available via internet, it can be a useful source to
property owned by individuals, their home addresses their delinquency
and the market and assessed values of the property. Also check to see if
receipts for payment of taxes are available. UCC filings _ liens assessed
against the property _ also can be found, commonly at the county and at
the Secretary of State’s office.
 Delinquent property records can be a treasure map to troubled
businesses and local property owners in trouble. They may even lead to
people who are politically connected in this way. In Kansas City, we found
that certain business owners who knew the system could get county
officials to waive penalty and interest on overdue property taxes. Although
the county maintained it was legal, we found by researching state law and
checking with state officials that it was absolutely illegal. In fact, $6 million
in penalties had been waived in just five years. Leads on that story came
by sorting delinquent property records. Those who owed the most often
sought the waivers.
 Layer these records. Take a particular property, find out who pays the
taxes. Usually those records will give you the property’s legal description.
Then use that description to trace that property’s ownership history in
county property records. Often, warranty deeds or deeds of trust will

reveal the true ownership. For example, ABC LLC owns the property
according to tax records. But state incorporation papers don’t reveal who
owns ABC LLC. The records only show the registered agent. But when
ABC LLC buys a piece of property, the officer for the company must sign
the deed. Bingo, you now know the owner.
 Property flipping. Once you trace property transactions you may notice
frequent purchases and sales. This can often tip you to property flipping,
which simply means the property was sold quickly for a profit. In itself,
flipping is not illegal. But it has become a common skam, often done with
a fraudulent appraisal. This allows the property to be sold to an investor or
homeowner for an inflated price. The owner, working in cohort with
whoever made the appraisal, can turn a quick and substantial profit. If you
notice that public agencies have sold property that was quickly flipped, it
might also be a sign that the agency has not properly advertised the
property for sale. And it may indicate someone had an insider deal to buy
the property for less than it was worth.
 Other records that may fill in gaps about ownership or who is behind
property transactions: city business licenses, state incorporation papers,
state or federal court records, including bankruptcy court and city
inspection and permit records. Kansas City government provides access
via the internet to permits and code inspections, which list contractors,
owners and even the estimated costs of the work.

HOUSING
How many millions of federal housing dollars has flowed into your community.
In large cities, you’re talking tens of millions each year flowing to community
development corporations and housing agencies that must use the money to
provide housing for low- to moderate-income residents or to remove blight.
What has it produced?
City housing programs that received federal dollars _ HOME and CDBG
(Community Development Block Grant) programs _ must each year award
those dollars or specify their spending. How does that program work? At the
end of the year, the city also is required to report how the dollars were spent.
So make the comparison _ what was planned compared to what was
produced.
 HUD maintains a database that tracks transactions, spending or credits
against federal housing grants. The system is called IDIS and often city
officials or housing agency officials have access to the system and can
report on the amount of dollars spent on a particular property or project.

 HUD inspector general reports often examine how well city programs or
city agencies have spent federal dollars. Check the HUD inspector
general’s website for reports in your area: http://www.hud.gov/offices/oig/
 Once you know which agencies in your area received federal dollars,
usually passed through a local government, ask for their annual financial
audits. Check with city auditors to see if they’ve any performance audits.
 Use your property records to confirm how many properties these agencies
own and local tax records to show whether they are keeping up with
property taxes.
 HUD regulations are thick and complex and, sometimes, open to
interpretation. HUD lawyers in regional offices or other HUD officials can
help you navigate through the gray areas.
 Some key questions: Was this contract competitively bid? Is it a not-toexceed contract? (If it’s cost-plus, then there’s a big problem) What about
subcontractors?
 Other questions and pursuits: Section 8 housing can produce numerous
stories. Is the housing substandard, frequently cited by codes? What
about inspections of the housing? Investors are often enticed to urban
cores to win a steady stream of federal payments for Section 8 housing.
It’s easy for them to allow those properties to run down.

Finally, standard texts on investigative journalism will devote at least a
chapter to property records and their use. They also may mention housing.
But few reporters use these standard tools on a regular basis.
