Whether you have years, months, weeks or days, you can find vital information about local
nonprofits, using the following:
•

First and foremost, IRS Form 990 or 990-PF. Annual tax returns IRS requires provide a
treasure trove of information, particularly in the schedules that detail salaries, deferred
compensation, fringe benefits, contractors, contributors etc. Review at least the last three
years. To understand these forms and disclosure laws: http://ftp.fedworld.gov/pub/irspdf/p557.pdf

•

These often are available at www.guidestar.org We don’t believe Guidestar is perfect,
as you’ll hear in our talk, but it’s a good resource.

•

The IRS website, www.irs.gov. Information on tax-exempt organizations.

•

State sites – Attorneys General, Charity Bureaus – check state tax returns. Many require
additional detailed financial and other statements. Laws differ among states. Check for
potentially tougher regulations.

•

Pay databases – Accurint, Autotrack – for corporate records, additional phone numbers,
past addresses, neighbors, property etc.

•

Charity website and articles of incorporation – online in some states – compare their
numbers to their tax returns

•

Local data – code enforcement, nonprofit registrations, criminal and civil court records

•

National Association of State Charity Officials - lists charity officers

•

Federal Trade Commission – monitors charitable fraud

•

Investigative Reporters & Editors (IRE) handbook has chapter on investigating nonprofits

•

Watchdogs – Better Business Bureau, National Charities Information Bureau etc.
