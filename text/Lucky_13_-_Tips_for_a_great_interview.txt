LUCKY 13
Tips for a good
interview

1) EVERYONE WANTS TO
TALK.
It’s your job to find a way to
get them to open up. Never
assume someone won’t
talk. It can become a selffulfilling prophesy.

2) BE SINCERE -- DON’T
PRETEND TO BE SINCERE.
If you’re really interested in
what people have to say,
they’re more likely to talk.

3) SWALLOW YOUR PRIDE.
If a source wants to
complain about the news
media or your news
organization, let them vent.
Once they get it all out of
their system, they’ll start
telling you want you want
to know.

4) PUT YOUR EGO ASIDE.
Especially with a reluctant
source or someone who’s
not used to being
interviewed, be humble
and go slow.

5) HAND-HOLDING.
Sources are often anxious
and fearful. It’s your job to
reassure them – or to
frankly assess the risks of
talking to you and explain
why taking a risk is the right
thing to do.

6) CREATING A
COMFORTABLE SPACE.
It can be tedious, but
sometimes you just have to
spend time letting a source
get to know you before
they feel comfortable
enough to talk.

7) READ VORACIOUSLY.
Before you approach your
source, devour everything
you can about the subject
so when something is
mentioned in the interview,
or appears in a document,
you’ll understand its
significance.

8) FLATTERY WILL GET YOU
EVERYWHERE.
It’s okay to inflate a
source’s ego by telling
them how important they
are to the story. Once they
start talking, you may find
they’re more important than
you realized.

9) BE ACCESSIBLE.
Make it easy for people to
find you, whether through a
tip-line, social media,
email, or telephone.

10) INDULGE THE CRAZIES.
Some tipsters may be
genuinely disturbed – they
may be calling direct from
a psychiatric ward – but
sometimes a tipster has
literally been driven crazy
by an injustice they’ve
suffered. You won’t know
unless you listen.

11) IF A SOURCE REFUSES TO
TAKE YOUR CALLS OR
RETURN YOUR EMAIL, WRITE
THEM A LETTER EXPLAINING
YOURSELF.
If that doesn’t work, write
them another letter to say
you’re still interested and
still need their help.

12) CONVEY THE BIG
PICTURE.
Many people are willing to
share information if they
believe it will help right a
wrong or otherwise
contribute to society.

13) THE COLD DOOR-KNOCK.
If a source refuses to talk, try
showing up on the front porch. Don’t
think of this as a hostile confrontation
(although it can be). Sometimes
sources will be impressed because
you took the time and made the
effort to pay them a visit. If they
don’t answer the door, leave a
hand-written note with your business
card and cellphone number.

BONUS TIP
Moving a source from
off the record to on the
record is often a matter
of time and trust.
