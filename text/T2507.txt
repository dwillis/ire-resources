Using CAR for Homeland Security on the Local Beat
IRE National Conference Denver 2005

How much your state and local governments received and how they spent the money is a worthwhile and
fairly simple project, once you decipher the alphabet soup of fkderal jargon.
Begin by finding out who in your state administers the State Homeland Security Grant Program, SHSGP
(pronounced shish-gap). These grants are awarded to 50. states based on population. There are a number of
different types of SHSGAP fit&, some for equipment, and some for non-equipment. Generally, states set
up regional oEces, boards or cwncils to figure out how to distribute the money locally.
Your i d k l public recads request might include the following total dollars received by your state, year by
year, spreadsheets of how grant mcwrq.was spent, year by year for each county; the state's goals and
objectives (for example, is radio interoperability the highest priority?), and the "wish lists" submitted by
agencies for items they would like to fbd.

I received the data etectronicaify. There were m e than 300 E x 4 spreadsheets; one for each type of grant,
times 95 counties, for several years. Beware that the names of the grants may change from year to year.
Oau 1-Team story fm Sepkmber 11,2004, concluM that Tennessee had spent less &an 26% of the gmut
money it received h m Congress in 2002 and 2003. None of the 2004 money had been spent at di.The
numbers are fhkly typical; it's a story that can be done in just about every state.

r e q d Are these valid expenses to fight terrarism? State oEcials in Tennessee say yes, that it doesn't
make sense to buy things that will sit on the shelf, unused. Smaller counties need the basics, they say.

A web page you'll want to check is the U.S. Departnment of Homeland Security, (www.dhs.gov)
