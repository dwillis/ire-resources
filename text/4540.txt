PDFs: A special kind of pain in the ass
● Two kinds of PDFs:
○
○

exported documents and spreadsheets
Scanned images

● Exported documents are much easier extract
○

glorified cut and paste

● Image documents require optical character recognition
(OCR) tech, manual data entry by you or Mechanical
Turk

Strategies to avoid PDFs

1 of 2

● Most public records laws state that while agencies do
not have to provide data to you in the format you
request, they must provide it in a format in which it
exists or its “native file format”
● PDF is not a data format

Strategies to avoid PDFs

2 of 2

● If a PR hack says they’re concerned about you messing
up the data, tell them you’re going to convert it anyway,
so they might as give it to you as data to begin with.
● The extraction process introduces opportunity for errors,
so if they have an interest in accuracy, gimmie the data
● Suggest they give you the data in a locked spreadsheet,
which is an easy extraction job

There is no silver bullet
● We’re getting closer, but some tools work
better than others for certain PDFs
● Every PDF is a unique and special
snowflake
● So we have to use the best tool for the job
● And we’ll ultimately end up doing data
cleaning in Excel afterwards
