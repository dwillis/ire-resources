Paid While Under Investigation
KMGH Denver
bit.ly/2WUg8Zr
Shows some area law enforcement paid
hundreds of thousands of dollars to
officers to sit at home while under
investigation for misconduct.

Speaker

Jace Larson

Tips

• Checked to see how far agencies can
go back in terms of a records search,
because they ran into an issue where
Denver could only provide two years
of electronic data – which made it
tough to make comparisons.
• Eliminate officer-involved shootings
or medical leave when you make the
request… or specifically ask for that
to be broken out. It muddies up the
numbers unless you have each
reason broken out. You wouldn’t —
for this story — probably include an
officer on paid leave for three days
after an OIS because that is standard
in every case.

Missing Guns
KNXV Phoenix
bit.ly/2XmHNQa
KNXV discovered Valley law enforcement
agencies are missing at least 110 firearms. But
the true number of missing weapons is likely
higher and impossible to calculate due to poor
and incomplete record keeping.

Tips
• Requested list of all missing, stolen,
and/or unaccounted for department
firearms and other weapons,
including any details about the type
of weapon and date reported missing.
• Requested copy of all policies,
directives, and orders regarding
documentation of missing, stolen,
and/or unaccounted weapons.
• Asked for all police reports filed
related to missing, stolen and/or
unaccounted for firearms and
weapons. Departments sometimes
file reports for when it goes missing
and if it’s recovered at a crime scene.

Fired & Rehired Officers
WEWS Cleveland
bit.ly/2Vr3Rac
Since 2004, about 100 officers were fired from
police departments in more than 50 Northeast
Ohio cities. However, agencies were often
forced to reinstate those officers resulting from
appeals required by union contracts.

Tips
• They found police officers are rarely
fired, so they requested a list of all
officers fired over a 15-year period
from more than 50 police
departments to get enough data.
• Ask for copies of arbitration
decisions, because they explain why
officers were reinstated after they
were fired. Reviewing their
decisions revealed patterns related
to how fired officers end up back on
the streets.

Schools

School Tornado Shelters
WMAQ Chicago
bit.ly/31iGML2
Found that fewer than one in every 100
Chicago-area public schools has a certified,
reinforced tornado shelter. We’ve created an
interactive map so you can find out what’s in
your child’s school.

Tips
• Illinois recently passed a law to
require newly-constructed schools
to have storm shelters that meet
national standards, so WMAQ filed
requests with 400 public districts in
17 counties to see which campuses
already had shelters
• Most districts didn’t have shelters,
because it’s very expensive. But
those existing schools aren’t
breaking the law.

Violent Classrooms
KGW Portland
bit.ly/2UE6y87
Verbal, physical and violent outbursts are plaguing
Oregon classrooms. The Oregon Education
Association – the union that represents 44,000
teachers across the state – released a report
calling classroom disruptions a “significant and
growing problem in classrooms.”

Speaker

Cristin Severance

Tips

• Focus on elementary schools. This
is where the problem is
happening most. Yes, middle and
high school teachers are seeing it
too but the emotional outbursts
are mostly with young kids.
• School districts do NOT track
these incidents but they do track
injuries. Request the staff injuries
caused by students for the last 3
to 5 years. This will give you the
hard data you need.

Mis-reported Bullying Data
WRTV Indianapolis

bit.ly/2XCvWNE

Despite the law, Indiana schools are
misreporting their bullying data. 60 percent
of schools reported no bullying last year.

Tips
• Looked at school bullying
incidents reported to the State
Department of Education and
searched for trends. If they do
not track bullying, ask your state
why? Ask lawmakers why they
don’t require reporting.
• Concerned parents contacted
them about bullying, however,
you can also reach out to local
PTO groups or Facebook chatter
groups to find bullying victims.

School Rainy Day Funds
WCAU Philadelphia
bit.ly/2I5ihJF
Some school districts in Philadelphia suburbs
have amassed large budget surplus accounts,
while still raising property taxes ever year. The
state Department of Education sets an annual
cap on the amount districts can raise in new
taxes, but their regulations can be avoided.

Tips

• Story can be repeated by analyzing any
taxing authority. Requires Excel skills
and a general understanding of financial
documents like balance sheets and
statement of cash flows. Numbers don’t
have to be complex. Ask simple
questions: How many tax increases have
there been over the past decade? How
much have taxes fluctuated? How have
those taxes been spent?
• Records to request are school district
budgets and any tax approval records. If
the financial numbers become
overwhelming, remember this is a story
about testing oversight. You are looking
to answer one basic question: Is anyone
watching those who tax us?

Workplace

Stay Away Pay
KARE Minneapolis
kare11.tv/31tgp58
Found public employees across Minnesota have been
paid millions of dollars to stay away from their jobs
while their bosses consider allegations of possible
misconduct, malfeasance or even crimes. Some of
those internal investigations lasted only a few days or
weeks, but others dragged on for months, even years.

Speaker

A.J. Lagoe

Tips
• Requested from state and local
governments all data for “paid
disciplinary leave” from the last
several years that lasted longer
than three months.
• Zeroed in on some of the most
egregious/long/expensive cases,
then requested the underlying
case files.

Deaths on the Job
WPTA Fort Wayne bit.ly/2WsO4rD
Uncovered challenges faced by families of
those killed in industrial accidents in Indiana,
including a limit on compensation they receive
even when a business is found to have acted in
a negligent manner.

Tips

• Get to know your state OSHA website. Safety
violation investigation reports should
be published and readily available without a
public record request. Download the
settlement reports. Pay attention to violations
that "exposed workers to risk of death.“
• Because most worker deaths are considered
accidents, they found many more than
previously reported.
• ever heard of or covered from relying solely on
the newsroom police scanner or press releases.
• Ask for everything obtained during legal
discovery. They used this as leverage to get
even more information (including diagrams of
how the machine was supposed to work) from
the manufacturer.

Public Cost of Sexual Harassment
WMAQ Chicago
bit.ly/2XCGQTA
Tracked down cases of government employees in
the Chicago area accused of sexual misconduct,
harassment, abuse, assault and even rape. Found
hundreds of lawsuits, complaints and internal
investigations filed over the past ten years,
costing taxpayers $55 million – so far.

Tips

• They email blasted 2,000 public agencies
across the Chicago area – from school districts
to administrative offices to park districts to
public library boards, etc., asking for all money
paid in settlements, judgements, separation
agreements and attorney fees as result of
those claims by any agency employee, official
or contractor.
• They realized their initial request too
narrow. The original intention was to “follow
the money,” but – in fact – when they asked,
agencies gave ALL of their complaints –
whether they resulted in a payout or
not. So, for anyone embarking on this project,
ask for everything, and make sure, when
asking for money, you also request money paid
by insurance companies.

Health/Medical

Concussion Safety
KNTV San Francisco
bit.ly/2ysGu7e
Children’s sports leagues across California are
required, by law, to follow certain safety
measures to guard against injuries resulting from
concussions. This report revealed a widespread
disparity in training and a serious lack of
enforcement could be putting thousands of
children at higher risk for brain injuries.

Tips
• Youth sports leagues, unlike private or
public schools, often have volunteer
coaches, who may not be familiar with the
state’s safety requirements.
• California does not require teams to submit
documentation proving compliance, nor
does the state lodge any type of penalties
against teams who break the law.
• KNTV surveyed 252 youth sports leagues
across the Bay Area to see if they are
following the law. More than 70 percent
wouldn’t share details on their safety
protocols. 47 percent admitted to not
following all of the state’s safety
requirements – responsible for the safety of
nearly 20,000 children.

Nursing Home Penalties
KPRC Houston
bit.ly/2MKIGAy
Texas nursing homes are among the worst in the
country when caring for our vulnerable elderly
and disabled loved ones. A new law meant to
punish the repeat offenders took effect in 2017.
KPRC in Houston followed up to find out if stiffer
financial penalties are making a difference.

Tips
• Obtained data from Centers for
Medicaid & Medicare Services
(link in tipsheet).
• Looked at sites with most
violations for specific time period,
categorized by violation level.
• Most violations are not major – so
“most” doesn’t mean “worst.”

Choking in Schools
WITI Milwaukee
bit.ly/2XAd95x
In Wisconsin, high school students are now
required to get CPR, Heimlich maneuver,
and first aid training before they're allowed
to graduate. It's a different story for the
adults in charge.

Tips
• Search your own archives and other
local news databases for stories of
choking incidents or fatalities.
Victims and their families often
want to share their stories as a
warning to others.
• A Michigan based training company
tracks which states requires
students to learn CPR (link in
tipsheet). They also track which
states require teachers to learn CPR.

Public Safety

Wildfire Brush Citations
KGTV San Diego
bit.ly/2Is0jjn
More than 40,000 homes in San Diego
are canyon rim properties, next to native
or naturalized vegetation. Legally, those
homeowners must have defensible
space of 100 feet – making sure brush
isn’t out of control.

Tips
• Look at timely stories. California is
prone to wildfires, so they did this
one as the anniversary of one of the
fires was approaching.
• Check to see if you actually need to
make a public records request, or
just ask the agency for the
information which might be more
readily available or translatable.

Dangerous Dogs
WSMV Nashville
bit.ly/2Ze2AWa
Dogs deemed vicious by a city court,
some ordered to be euthanized for their
violent attacks, are still living in Nashville
neighborhoods.

Tips
• Request the “entire file” of all the animals
deemed “vicious” in your city to get the
victims who live near the animals
deemed vicious that were spared.
• Be very transparent with your victims,
especially if they still live near the vicious
animal, that you would like to interview
them but it may inflame the situation.
• File requests to have a camera in the city
court that deems animals as “vicious”
and document a few cases – they’re
always emotional and good TV.

Volunteer Firefighter Training
KXAN Austin
bit.ly/2J4XqqO
Three years after the deadly West fertilizer plant
explosion, the U.S. Chemical Safety Board sent
out a list of safety recommendations, including an
unfulfilled requirement for all Texas volunteer
firefighters to be trained on fertilizer-grade
ammonium nitrate. KXAN found only a small
number the 30,000 volunteers statewide have
taken the course created after that catastrophe.

Tips

• This certification was created in Texas, but states
with large agriculture industries may consider it.
• Check to see how many fertilizer facilities there
are in your area. The state fire marshal’s office
presented challenges in obtaining that
information due to security concerns, but data
was available from the Texas Department of
State Health Services – 121 facilities in 71 Texas
counties that stored more than 10,000 pounds of
the same type of fertilizer.
• Because the volunteer fire departments require
state safety checks and get funding from the
state, they are required to submit training
reports to the state fire marshal’s office – so
that’s the way to find how many firefighters
have taken part in this training and also how
many of them live/work in areas where these
facilities exist.

Emergency Inside 911
WTHR Indianapolis
bit.ly/2lBltvz
Reported emergency operators in Indianapolis
have been dealing with an emergency of their
own: a severe shortage of dispatchers,
contributing to rising 911 wait times. Dispatcher
pay contributed to the problem.

Tips
• Request the call response time data
from the 911 call center (the time to
pick up a call and talk to a caller, not
the time for an ambulance to arrive on
scene). Go back at least a year because
sometimes the data can be seasonal.
Compare the call pickup times to the
standards from the National Emergency
Number Association.
• Request starting salaries from all of the
surrounding or relevant counties for
comparison.

Transportation

Gas Meter Crashes
KXAS Dallas
bit.ly/2Tybu1u
Gas meters found close to roads are damaged in
crashes far more than one might expect. TxDOT
data shows vehicles struck roadside gas meters
more than 3,600 times in eight years, sparking
concerns of leaks and explosions.

Tips
• Obtained motor vehicle crash data from
2010 through 2018 from the Texas
Department of Transportation. Law
enforcement agencies files these reports
for any crashes on public roadways that
involve a death, injury or more than
$1,000 in property damage.
• TxDOT’s crash report database includes a
section for damaged property (other than
vehicles), so they searched for gas meters
that way. However, the data didn’t give
the exact location of the meters, whether
they were protected, or the extend of the
meter damage.

Train Crash Odds
WSMV Nashville
bit.ly/2WmThBn
The federal government scores every location
where a railroad crosses a public street. They
track how likely a particular crossing will be to
have a collision in any given year. WSMV used
those prediction numbers to identify the top 10
railroad-highway crossings in the Nashville area
at the highest risk for a collision.

Tips
• You can build custom reports on the Federal
Railroad Administration website. Choose
your state or certain counties. Beware that
if you search by county, you may not always
include every city in that county.
• Once you have crossings of interest, check
with your state DOT to see if the crossings
have been upgraded. FRA data was not
always current.
• In the case where there was an accident,
request the accident report from your local
police department. It will generally have
the victim’s name and phone number.

Bus Service for Disabled Riders
WTHR Indianapolis
bit.ly/2lBltvz
Discovered Indianapolis’ bus service for ruders
with disabilities plagued by extremely long wait
and ride times. Many riders were trapped on
buses for hours, forced to miss critical
appointments and stranded from jobs.

Tips
• Ask for three to six months of complaints
about the paratransit bus service. Also ask
for three to six months of “on-time” rates.
These will help you spot any trends.
• In Indy, the city’s bus service expanded
the paratransit service area beyond the
federally-mandated distance from a
regular bus stop. That exacerbated the
problem and over-extended resources.
• Your city’s bus service should be able to
tell you how many people are registered
for the paratransit service in your area and
what the boundaries are, eligibility set by
the US Dept. of Transportation under the
1990 ADA.

Environmental

Radon Testing at Schools
WRTV Indianapolis
bit.ly/2JckC4a
Uncovered most Indiana schools do not test for
radon gas, a carcinogen known to cause lung
cancer, despite federal recommendations that all
schools test at least once every five years.

Speaker

Kara Kenney

Tips
• Ask the State Department of
Health or State Department of
Education for data on which
schools have been tested for
radon and when. If they do not
have data for schools, ask the
agency for a data dump of all
radon test results and sort out
schools by name/address.
• If they do not have any data,
conduct your own survey of
schools, email dozens of schools
and ask when they last tested and
what those results were.

Firefighter Asbestos
KNSD San Diego
bit.ly/2WMGU67
Asbestos at a fire academy put thousands of
San Diego firefighters at risk of serious lung
disease. Documents revealed the department
failed to act quickly and decisively to protect
first responders in training.

Tips
• Requested data or inspection reports
for the city’s “Asbestos, Lead & Mold
Program,” which showed where
inspectors are going most often and
more detail about what they found.
• Also, the EPA has good information
about “superfund sites” or the
“National Priorities List,” which is a list
of federal properties deemed to contain
hazardous materials.
• Good to put asbestos into perspective,
as the material is not harmful if left
undisturbed.

Testing Water After Threat
KHOU Houston
bit.ly/2I0rsve
KHOU had water samples from the Houston
Ship Channel tested by professionals to find
out whether public parks and local beaches
were contaminated after the ITC fire.

Tips

• The team spent two days taking
samples according to specific
rules and turned them over to a
certified lab.
• The results didn’t reveal
problems but it showed viewers
they were looking out for their
safety.

Financial

Sidewalk Settlements
WCAU Philadelphia
bit.ly/2Zgss3w
Crumbling sidewalks have cost $17 million in
injury settlements for Philadelphia taxpayers
in the last three years, proving to be a major
expense in far-reaching ways beyond pouring
new concrete.

Tips

• Started as a request to the city for
civil settlements, looking for sexual
harassment payouts. Most money
was spent on “sidewalk fall downs.”
• Obtained some of the highest
payouts’ court documents to find
people involved and checked the
location of the “fall” to see if the
sidewalk had been fixed. Just make
sure to be transparent with your
audience that you only took a
sample of a larger set of data.

Court-ordered Payments for Fraud
KSL Salt Lake City
bit.ly/2KEkhtV
Investigated why federal court-ordered payments
to crime victims often go unfulfilled. They
reviewed a half dozen recent fraud cases to
understand how judges weighed what amount
should be repaid and how. Still, it added up to a
massive amount - $800 million – much of which
will never be collected.

Tips

• Federal restitution orders are
only good for 20 years but can be
extended.
• Find financial fraud cases that
have been sentenced. However,
sometimes victims are
confidential – so look for their
statements in court
files/transcripts.

Oil & Gas Regulation
KXAN Austin

kxan.com/oil-empire

Discovered Texas’ top oil and gas regulator and her politically
prominent family earned money off hundreds of industry
leases checkered across the state — the same industry she was
elected to regulate. KXAN discovered, since the start of 2014,
she voted hundreds of times on agenda items brought by
companies that pay her and her family royalties or dividends.

Tips

• To avoid paying thousands of dollars on
public information requests and industry
website subscriptions, KXAN traveled to
nearly a dozen isolated communities on the
west Texas plains to search through county
courthouses in person for mineral and
royalty deeds, trusts and more.
• Comparing the results of that research to
matters brought before the Railroad
Commission, KXAN found the chair has
voted on items that appear to overlap with
specific leases in which she and her family
have financial stakes. The review of meeting
minutes and video archives revealed no
disclosures of possible conflicts of interest.

Charity Spending
WTAE Pittsburgh
bit.ly/2wPOOg5
Found some charities are spending little on
their own programs. An analysis of
Pennsylvania charity spending records shows
the money frequently goes to fundraising
expenses and salaries.

•

•

Tips

Check with your state’s charities
regulator. Some states gather
summary financial information and
post on their web site. You can file an
FOI request to get a spreadsheet of
the data that is on the web. Or you
could scrape it. Then run a simple
Excel formula to determine the
percentage of expenses or donations
going to programs.
To get details on where the money is
going for specific charities, check out
guidestar.org. You want to get the 990
– the annual tax form filed by
charities and foundations. Look for
top salaries and top contractors.

Drugs

Drunk Drivers Avoiding Prison
WRC Washington, D.C.
bit.ly/2I3BXO4
Nearly all drunken drivers who caused crashes on
Maryland’s troubled Indian Head Highway avoided
jail sentences over the past three years. A review of
more than 40 DUI crashes on the highway shows
most drivers were spared from serving time behind
bars, despite causing injuries or having DUI histories.

Speaker

Scott MacFarlane

Tips

• Police, fire and EMS
agencies universally
maintain data by
address. You should be able
to FOIA broader sets of data
(cases, fires, medical
emergencies, arrests,
crashes) on certain
highways or roads.
• Attorneys often do this, so
check to see if they already
have. That might make the
FOIA “free of charge.”

Field Test Drug Kits
WAGA Atlanta
bit.ly/2Ww5YPt
Found a field drug test kit popular among
police actually turned out to be wrong more
than 140 times across Georgia in a single year.
False positives implicated innocent people,
jailed for crimes like drug possession or drug
trafficking when they really had things like air
freshener or vitamins.

Tips

• Ask your state crime lab that processes
suspected drugs to provide a database
of all negative test results for a given
time period. Make sure they include
the original requesting agency.
• Go back to the law enforcement
agency you cover (or several) and ask
for the incident report that led to that
suspected drug case. Read them and
see whether they mention a positive
"field test," "NIK test" or similar
language for that specific item sent off
for analysis. If you get a hit, you know
you've got a false positive.

Students Using THC
WPRI Providence
bit.ly/2WoIzun
Rhode Island public schools have seen a surge in use
of ultra-potent levels of THC — the psychoactive
ingredient in marijuana — over the past year,
resulting in some students hauled away in an
ambulance. This comes as vaping has grown in
popularity, and teenagers are swapping out nicotine
cartridges, or "pods," for those filled with THC oil.

Tips

• State education departments track an
enormous amount of data through a
Uniformed Chart of Accounts (UCOA).
Regarding THC use, the state likely tracks it
in two ways: tobacco and controlled
substances. Ask for year over year data.
• Ask for all police and fire calls for service
for high schools and middles schools. WPRI
chose the 13 largest districts. Separately
ask school districts for the number of
rescues called to their schools as a result of
an adverse reaction to THC. In some cases
schools weren’t cooperative but public
safety agencies were, and vice versa.
