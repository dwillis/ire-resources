Uncovering stories on the schools beat- IRE conference 2016 – New Orleans
Helpful mentalities on the education beat, by Francisco Vara-Orta, Education Writers Assn.:
1. Use daily assignments and features as ways to build trust with skeptical folks.
2. Train sources and tipsters to know without the documents and the data their complaints are somewhat
useless to get situations changed.
3. Create an effective organizational system of how you keep your notes, audio, data and print materials.
4. Simply read high-quality journalism on education, ask if your market is doing any of those types of
stories and mimic their ideas.
5. Realize the education beat is usually a revolving door in many places so people often don’t invest, and
so if you care, say it. Lobbying about the importance of good education journalism is a good habit
outside the newsroom as much as it is when shopping your pitches.
6. Always do criminal record and clip searches on school board candidates and top school officials, and
on anyone you are quoting in an official role as much as you can around breaking deadlines. Teacher
discipline databases have many flaws and loopholes from state to state. And sometimes school districts
don’t even know if a school board member with a criminal record can be banned from campus.
7. Education is often an emotional issue for those working in the field. They often agree in the final
destination but not how to get there.
8. Get in the habit of asking folks if anything bothers them casually even when reporting a bright.
9. Tell the sources you trust to pass along your card and give them extras to send along.
10. Do clip searches and ask, have these policies been implemented and what has been the result?
11. Become a school district historian – that way you can identify cyclical behavior such as
superintendent-school board turnover and tensions and their effect on the schools.
12. Twitter searches on teachers and students.
13. Build relationships with your school districts’ lawyers.
14. Read what industry publications your sources may read to catch a problematic trend early on
15. Check in with higher education sources about any partnerships with schools they are studying.
16. Chip at the iceberg. Investigative work takes time and is hard when you’re feeding the beast. But you
can use those techniques over time and that will build credibility. In fact, the diversity of stories on the
beat will offer some good will that you can tap into when you need to later press sources on
accountability or sensitive stories. Better to get things on record and condition readers to their realities
than just always waiting for a big takeout piece if on a beat.
17. Find the narrative in the data or documents – it’s about the kids, y’all! (And taxpayers’ right to know.)
