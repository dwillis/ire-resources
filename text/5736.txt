Internet browser reads them top to bottom
Every rule should end with a semicolon

Simply: if something happens, do something to the webpage
Ex: if someone clicks a button, change the page's background color
Doesn't have to be visually obvious
■ Ex: analytics, if someone visits a page, count it

function changeColor() {
var header = document.getElementById("my-header");
header.style.color = 'red';
}
