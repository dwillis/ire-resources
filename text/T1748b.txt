Data
Thanks to the beauty of the Internet, most of the Census Bureau’s data is available for
free. Trouble is, it’s not the easiest thing in the world to get to. You have been warned.

The Census Bureau gives users access to all of the Census 2000 data on American
Factfinder. The site offers quick tables under Basic Facts, and more detailed data queries
are available in the Data Sets area.

Maps
A lot of Census data is better viewed through a map. Fortunately, those too are free.

ESRI, which makes the mapping software ArcView, makes Census TIGER maps
available for free in their format. Census also makes maps available, but only in TIGER
format, which is not easily readable by most mapping software.

Mapping Software
If you don’t have mapping software, or just want a quick way to view maps, ESRI makes
a free map viewer called ArcExplorer.

Spreadsheet Software
Most of what you need to do with the Census can be done in a spreadsheet. If you don’t
have Excel and the newsroom bean counters aren’t in a spending mood, a free
spreadsheet program – a nearly exact clone of Excel – is available from OpenOffice.org.
