Using data to customize
your storytelling

Congratulations, you have a
huge dataset
Now what is the best way to show it?!

Is the story all the data? Or just some of it?
The first question to ask yourself when you’re trying to figure out the best
presentation for a large dataset: “Is the story about the entirety of the data or
about subsets in the data?”
The tendency to want to show the entire dataset is normal. “The scale,” we cry!
“You have to see it to believe it,” we insist! Often that can lead you down the
wrong path, and it can be consequential because it can be time-consuming to try
to visualize very large datasets.

Sometimes it can be both, but you still want to start by asking yourself that
question.

When the story is all the data: The Follower Factory
Visualizing the followers of some Twitter accounts was actually fundamental to
the reporting and telling the story.
Mark Hansen, PhD statistician and director of the Brown Institute at Columbia was
working with us to try to discover bots among followers in Twitter accounts that we
know had purchased fake followers.
We pulled down tens of millions of followers for thousands of accounts and began
making different types of plots. Mark made one comparing the order in which
accounts followed with the date accounts were made and the visualization was a
revelation.

🚨 HOLY SHIT 🚨

Seeing the story in
all the data
This is a case where the entirety of the
data makes the story. By visualizing all
of it, we reveal bot activity!
These are four plots that show how bot
accounts created in short bursts of
time followed paying clients in rapid
succession.
We’re also using small multiples of big
data to reinforce our finding.

But we knew these charts were hard to
grasp. Seeing the patterns is easy, but
understanding the plots is more
complicated. We used annotations in
print, but were more ambitious online.

But often it’s the stories in the data that matter
For a story we were doing on phone apps tracking and selling your location we
acquired an enormous dataset comprised of hundreds of millions(!) of locations
from over one million devices.
And while hundreds of millions of data points is cool… if we followed the tendency
I mentioned earlier – to show all the data because ‘whoa data’ – it would look like
this mess.

Finding the stories in a sea of data
A reporter on our desk, Michael Keller, built custom software to help us find the
stories in the data, because we knew that the power of the data was in actually
revealing the individual paths that were in it.
The companies claimed the data was ‘anonymized’ but it quickly became apparent
that there was nothing anonymous about it.
We watched people go to Planned Parenthood, to gay bars, to churches and
mosques. We watched somebody in the mayor of New York’s security detail follow
him to the gym. We watched a child play on a playground. We watched a
detective investigate a homicide.

One in a million
This is an example where it’s much
more powerful to view slices of the
dataset.
In about four months’ of data reviewed
by The Times, Lisa Magrin’s location
was recorded over 8,600 times — on
average, once every 21 minutes.
But we also realized that showing the
entirety of the data had visual impact.
It was crazy! So we combined the two
approaches for the opening video.
