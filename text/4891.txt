EnergyWire is a publication of E&E Publishing, based in Washington, which focuses
on energy consumption and production.
E&E is the leading source for comprehensive, daily coverage of environmental and
energy policy and markets.
E&E's five daily online publications are considered "must-reads" by people who track
and influence energy, environmental and climate policy, science and business.
We have more than 60 journalists, spread from Washington to California. Our daily
circulation of about 40,000 includes top decision makers in industry, Congress and at
EPA, Interior and other federal agencies.

Where
I've focused:
-

State oil and gas agencies, federal
regulation of oil and gas
production

-

Earthquakes linked to drilling,
wastewater disposal

-

Safety of drilling, OSHA

It's not

"Fracking"

What is "fracking?"
-

One part of drilling a
well?

-

Everything to do with
oil and gas?

-

Does it matter, if you
and your source are
talking about different
things?

State agency websites
-

Vary widely in style and
substance

-

Often geared more to
companies than the public

-

Learn your way around before
a big incident

Spills
-

Are they going up or down in your
state?

-

What's getting spilled?

-

Are they getting cleaned up?

-

Are the companies getting fined?

Fines and Enforcement
-

Are fines up or down?

-

Data is hard to find.

-

Was there a fine for that
big spill? Did it get
reduced in the end?

-

Do your state officials
believe in fines? Many
don't?

FracFocus.org
-

Industry-supported, industryfunded, but not industry-run

-

Data has been needlessly hard to
access, but getting better.

-

Hobbyist computer expert is making
the data more accessible.

-

Data is sent monthly to state
agencies

Pipelines and pipeline spills
-

Big interstate lines are
handled by feds: PHMSA

-

Smaller lines regulated by
states - if at all

-

PHMSA keeps a lot of
information on each
operator

-

After an incident, they post
information

-

Companies set up incident
pages

Labor Department Safety Data
-

Census of fatal
occupational injuries,
Bureau of Labor Statistics

-

OSHA Establishment
Search

-

OSHA inspection reports
(FOIA)

U.S. Geological Survey
-

Is there really enough oil and gas in
your area to warrant drilling?

-

Earthquakes - reliable data on
everything magnitude 3 and higher

-

Water contamination studies
