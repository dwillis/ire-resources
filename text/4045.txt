Editing the data-driven
story

Meet the data

Early focus
There are roughly two types of data projects:
ones that emanate from data, and ones that use
data as a reporting tool. Which one is yours?
Data projects can go narrow and deep, or wide
and deep. The latter takes significant time and
resources.
So, as an editor you’ll want to narrow your focus
early.
But recognize that from a data perspective it’s
easier to start wide and go narrow than to double
back.

Don’t reinvent the wheel
Ask early what kinds of data might be available.
Beyond the obvious, are there other data sets
available? Have others done similar reporting? If
so, what data did they use and how?
Check IRE/NICAR tipsheets to see if anyone has
worked with similar data.
Read professional/academic literature to identify
experts in your area of interest/inquiry who might
have worked with similar data and be able to
advise you and your reporters.
Read the database records layout so that you

Digital filing cabinets
What do you want to know? Databases are like
filing cabinets full of information that can be
unlocked with the right questions.
Think in concentric circles: What can the data tell
you about the problem locally, regionally,
statewide, nationally?
How does your local problem compare to the
state, how does the state compare to the nation?
How does it compare internationally? (As our
environmental correspondent likes to say, if
Texas were a separate nation, it would rank 7th

Know the data

Data is not magic
Be as skeptical of it as you are with human
sources.
If there is a “read me” file that accompanies the
data, read it.
Ask about problems with the data. All data are
“dirty.” The question is how dirty.
Ask who collects the data and why. Is the
database a clearinghouse of unvetted
information, or is it carefully gathered and
targeted? This may say something about the
data’s reliability.

Dive into the data
Review preliminary data findings
with the reporters, ask
questions.
Review new rounds of analyses,
ask more questions, repeat as
necessary.
Dig into the data yourself.
Here’s the first spreadsheet I got

Where’s the story?
The top tier of counties where all bridges were
deemed deficient…

What’s my angle?
Below are the last six counties in Texas and their
% bridge deficiency ratings

Editor brain freeze
The spreadsheet for the 15 worst bridges in
Texas. More than 160 data fields for each bridge.

Understand the data

Ask questions about the
data
Looking at the data helps editors formulate
questions, from basic to advanced:
Why are there only 250 listings for Texas, when
there are 254 counties? Are we missing data or
do four counties have no bridges or no problem
bridges?
Does it make a difference in safety ratings
whether or not a bridge is part of a toll road?
(Answer from previous panel is, yes.)

Bulletproof the data
Ask reporters early and often what worries them
about the data.
Is it the data itself? The study methodology?
Over-eager editors, or ones with pre-determined
story lines? Unrealistic deadlines?
Ask reporters how they have verified their data
analysis. Did they vet their methodology with a
subject matter expert? Did they keep a data
diary? Did they re-import the data from scratch
and re-run the entire analysis?

More bulletproofing
If you have the luxury of more than one data
analyst in your newsroom, ask one to re-check
the other.
Have them work independently of each other:
audit scripts, review data diaries, recheck each
major finding against the original database (as
opposed to a derivative spreadsheet).
Share your results with targets early. Give them a
chance to attack your data and methodology and
allow enough time for you to consider their
criticisms.

Don’t forget the humans
Data are the underpinning of big investigations,
like girders on a bridge.
But you need humans to tell your story. Who are
they?
Do a ride-along with a bridge inspector. (Or
maybe find a Pistol?)
Figure out what kind of traffic uses the bridge
regularly and talk to those people (Commuters?
School buses? Mass transit?)

Visit the data

Ground truth
Verify your data wherever possible
with on-the-ground reporting.
Or, if you have too many sites, use
Google Earth to determine which
ones to visit.
This verification is especially
important for data sets like the
bridge data.

The bridges of Dallas
Three bridges inCounty
Dallas County were among the
10 worst in the state. Or were they?

Two of the listings are different ends of the
same bridge, which had already been closed
for repairs.

But we checked anyway!

So we went looking
for the “baddest” of
all bridges in Dallas
County.

The bridge at California Crossing

Was it opened or closed? Under construction or not?
Is Jon showing us that people can drive over a faulty
bridge under repair?

We decided to look deeper.
Behind the first bridge, we found another …

So Jon went in for a closer look …
and found a new bridge under construction.

Be ready to recalculate
Find other bridges in Dallas County with bad
ratings. And pay them a visit.

working with data requires careful scrutiny.
