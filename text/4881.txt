Thinking Outside the Box
Taking Obvious Stories on a Deeper Dive
I.

II.

III.

Water Crisis – this is boring and obvious, no investigation, nothing
to see, here
a. How do you turn a current event that is important to your
community into an investigation?
b. Shoe Leather…Do your Research…Go to seminar with
experts…go to lunch…attend classes…read books
c. Do lots of legwork before you start to videotape (can do
while doing other work on other stories)…Al Tompkins
“gather string”
d. Find contrasts (Israel v California, high tech co v California
regulations)
Blinded by the Lights – no way this is a story
a. Sources developed over the years tipped off to problem
b. Incredible sounding—asked a lot of questions like “what?
Are you kidding me?”
c. Worked lots of sources behind scenes to find one or two to
talk on camera
d. Worked more sources just to get video
e. Sat and watched at events and videotaped with home
camera
f. Bott—went further and asked “what do e-mails show?
g. Test agency’s public statements vs. what they’re talking
about behind the scenes
h. Found other reports in e-mails when didn’t know existed
Stolen Cop Guns – seemingly impossible story

a. Bott—asked the simple question after Kate Steinle murder…
how many cop agencies actually lose their guns…filed FOIA’s
and CA CPRA’s
b. Negotiated and pressed when they didn’t want to give up
c. Also asked for audits
i. Some agencies will only give you exactly what you
asked for…others will be more broad…try and be broad
in request and negotiate down from there
d. Think about other ways to get at the story…found FBI lost
and stolen gun report
