Threat Modeling
• Enumerating the risks involved for a user or
business, and ways to mitigate those risks

• Simplified version: the

who/what/where/when/why/how of thinking
about security & risk.

Threat Modeling
• Who are your enemies?
• Why might you be targeted?
• What might be used against you?
• What could go wrong in your day-to-day?
• How secure do you need it?

Data at rest. What's on your computer? What's

Data in motion. Communication! Calls,
messages, files sent; anything out of your hands.

Data at rest. What's on your computer? What's

Data in motion. Communication! Calls,

Metadata. Who are you talking to & when. How
big are those files/msgs?

Identities & logins.

Help is on the way

Mobile tools: Secure calling and messaging
Web browsing:
-More encryption & malware blocking.
-Anonymous browsing
Messaging: Secure chats and video calls
E-mail & file encryption

Software updates
Security holes in Windows, Mac, and Linux, are
discovered on a near-daily basis. Same with
browsers and most other software.
(When it annoys you to restart & update, just
do it!)

Passwords
Don't use the same couple of passwords
everywhere.
Your e-mail password needs to be stronger than
your bank’s. (At least you can call up your bank
for help if there’s fraud. Not so much w/e-mail.)
E-mail owns your other accounts — nearly
every website has an “I forgot my password”
feature that e-mails you.

Passwords
An 8 letter password with numbers and symbols
can be cracked in a few days, but an 8 word
phrase could take centuries.
“Pass phrases” — use a string of words. (A
phrase instead of a word.)

Passwords
Diceware: a secure way to generate passphrases,
without needing a computer!
Roll five dice (or one die five times) and write
down the result. Use a wordlist to convert it
into a random word.
Repeat until you have a passphrase as long as
you desire!

Passwords
16664 cleat
16665 cleft
16666 clerk
21111 cliche
21112 click

Password Managers
Can’t remember a different phrase for every
website? Use a password manager.
Helps you use a different password everywhere
and generate totally random passwords for
every website.
1Password
LastPass
Dashlane
KeePassX

Two Factor Login
• Helps keep an account secure, even if your
password is stolen.

• First factor: “something you know”
(your password)

• Second factor: “something you have”
(your phone)

• You (or an evildoer) need both to get into your
accounts.

• Google has it,Yahoo has it,Twitter, Facebook,
Dropbox, lots of banks.

Two Factor Login

Two Factor Login

Secure deletion
• When you delete a file from your computer,
you’re only deleting it from the “table of
contents” of your drive.

• Data still there until something else needs to use
those unused “pages.”

• A “secure” delete writes random data into the
place where the file was.

Secure deletion
●

Erasing files:
“Secure Empty Trash” on Mac:
hold ⌘ key when right-clicking Trash.
●
CCleaner (Windows)
●

●

Erasing free space (to wipe files that you didn’t
erase securely):
Disk Utility (Mac)
●
CCleaner (Windows)
●

File encryption
• Protects files
• Use case: sending sensitive files or putting files
on USB sticks to share.

• VeraCrypt – encrypts files, folders, USB drives
• MiniLock – encrypts files
• Peerio – encrypts files & has built-in secure
messaging

Full disk encryption
• Protects all data on your computer, when your
computer is turned off.

• Use case: Protects if computer is stolen
• Performance impact usually negligible, unless you’re
doing disk-heavy things like video editing or
compiling software.

• Apple FileVault (Mac)
• BitLocker (Windows “Pro” or “Enterprise” versions)

Browser Plugins
• HTTPS Everywhere

– If a website has an encrypted version, automatically use

that instead!
– https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere

Browser Plugins
• Ublock Origin

– Not just for ad blocking! You can prevent your browser

from communicating with malware sites.
– Chrome:

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-or
igin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm
– Firefox:
●

●

https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/ublock-origin/

VPNs
• Relay your traffic so websites don't know who you are.
●

Great for research so websites don’t know you
visited them & your ISP doesn’t know either.

• But VPN provider knows who you are and where your
traffic is going.

Tor
• Anonymized internet access so websites don’t know
where you are
●
Great for research so websites don’t know you
visited them & your ISP doesn’t know either.

• Sends your traffic through random volunteer relays for
anonymity.

• Caveat: Slow
• Caveat: Be careful with logins! Relays see your traffic
unless it's HTTPS (but they don't see where your
traffic is coming from).

Tor

• Interactive example of what's protected by HTTPS and
what's protected by Tor:
●
https://www.eff.org/pages/tor-and-https

Tor
PC/Mac: https://www.torproject.org/
iOS: Onion Browser (disclosure: I work on this)
Android: Orbot

Encrypted Chat: OTR
• “Off The Record” encryption protects messages

between you and someone else.
●
Not the same as Google “Off The Record” mode

• Use an existing account (like GChat or others) & use
an OTR plugin to encrypt.
●
You can register an account at other chat services
too, to avoid Google knowing about your chats.

• Caveats:
• Metadata – who you are talking to and when – is
still seen by the chat service.

OTR Encryption

Encrypted Chat: OTR
●

●

Tor Messenger provides OTR encryption and lets you
use accounts on many messaging services (Google
Chat, Twitter DMs, XMPP/Jabber).
●
In addition to OTR, it uses Tor to mask your IP
address.
ChatSecure does most of the same things for iPhone
and Android.

Encrypted Chat: Ricochet

●

●

Ricochet uses Tor to provide an encrypted chat
connection directly to your contact.
Decentralized service, no registration required, there
is no third party to get your metadata

Encrypted Chat: Ricochet

Encrypted Texts
• Signal (iOS & Android)
• Threema & WhatsApp (iOS & Android) are also popular
and have end-to-end encryption.

• iMessage (iOS) claims to encrypt messages, but Apple sees
metadata and may have access to the messages.

Encrypted Calls
• Signal (iOS & Android)

Voice calls on your phone
Jitsi Meet (PC/Mac)
●

•

●

Video conference calls, like Google Hangout or
Skype. In your web browser.

• FaceTime (iOS): Like iMessage.
●

Prevents cell provider from knowing who you
call. But again, Apple may have access to the
metadata and actual call.

PGP: Encrypted email
Also known as GPG — for “GnuPG”, one of the
programs that does this
You get a public and private key, you have to
download someone's public key before you can
send them an encrypted message.
Historically hard to set up and use.

PGP

• Mac: Thunderbird+ Enigmail

or GPGTools + Mail app

• Windows: Thunderbird+ Enigmail

or GPG4Win + Outlook

• In-browser Chrome plugin for webmail:
Mailvelope

• Setup guides:

But what about other
tools?
• New tools come out all the time.
• We don’t necessarily know what’s secure. Follow
a lot of security experts to see what their
consensus is.

• Consider the encryption, metadata-masking

capabilities, and transparency of how tools work:
●

But what about other
tools?
• Look for tools that are open-source (so anyone
can check their code) and have been audited by
independent security experts

• What kinds of metadata does the tool log?
– See Signal’s policy & response to subpoena
