Intranets at the Fort Worth Star-Telegram

Some basic questions …
How should this thing look?
We’ve evolved, sort of, over the years.
The first attempt, in 1997, was very basic:

The next, in 1999, was a step or two beyond:

Each of the six topic areas led to long lists of links. The ``S-T databases’’ was a wish-list item for
searchable in-house databases that we got up two years later, in 2001.
Staffers said this presentation confused them because they could not remember which of the six
topic areas led to the link they were looking for.

So, next in 2001 we opted for a links smorgasbord that confronted people the first time the home
page came up:

Each of the toggles in the middle of the page had a fairly lengthy links list, most leading directly to
a search form of one kind or another.
Some folks now complain that this is way too much to confront their eyes every time their Web
browser comes up. But others like the one-hop nature of having a lot of links that can be clicked
on right away.
That leads to another question …

How to display in-house (intranet) and out-of-shop (government, etc.) search pages?
Keeping all your in-house searches on a page that announces that this is our stuff can help folks
understand where the information comes from. But we opted to mix in links to in-house searches
with outside search pages, to keep things simple and organized by topic.
So, our campaign finance links list includes a link to our in-house database of local contributions
to county and city office-holders, along with links to the Texas Ethics Commission and FEC.

We’ve tinkered over the years, adding and dropping things as events and newsroom projects
came and went:
-- a message board that also lets you post pictures,
-- editor’s critiques of selected editions of the paper,
-- new style guides, design guides, etc.
-- an editor’s newsletter,
-- a moderated message board on the future of the paper,
-- search boxes for often-requested things, like city populations, police arrest records, etc.

So now we look like this, still busy but generally helpful:

People can:
-- Search Google and Yahoo directly, or choose another search engine.
-- Go directly to our local property-assessment agency’s search, medical examiner,
backgrounding service (Accurint), a list of people-finder sites, Guidestar, etc.
-- Check a guide/checklist for deadline and long-term records-searching. It’s our “Watchdog” inhouse project. Also, a guides to getting court records, multimedia reporting, etc.
-- Quickly find many in-house pages directly linked so people don’t have to remember the
sometimes torturous URLs: our ombudsman’s reports (ONOTES), a News Art tracking system we
created using SQL Server and ASP, the photo assignment system, our in-house phone list (also
ASP and SQL Server), ethics, history, etc.
-- Post notes to our message board. Sometimes used, sometimes not!
-- Quickly search local populations, arrests, registered voter records.
-- Go directly to news-industry sites and reference tools.
-- Peruse lists of links to in-house and outside searches, by topic area.

Some other questions …

Who will do this thing?
• Papers have a wide variety of intranet handlers, but most often it’s the computerassisted reporting person/people. That’s the case here in Fort Worth and in Charlotte
and other places.
• News researchers are the other most frequent intranet handlers. That’s the case in
San Antonio. Pat Stith of the N&O urges that news researchers handle intranets to
``institutionalize your gains.’’
• Try to keep the day-to-day shepherding of the intranet in news peoples’ hands, not
your information-services/IT folks. Even if they mean well, IT folks don’t have a news
perspective.

What platform will you use?
• We use SQL Server and ASP pages at the Star-Telegram. That has worked best
because that’s what our IT department knows and will trust us with (!).
• Open-source platforms like MySQL and PHP are very highly regarded. With luck you
can convince your IT folks to try that instead.
• Think about what software will work best for displaying data to your readers through
your Web site. We use SQL Server and ASP for that too. Others prefer Apache/PHP
and other platforms.

Things we could do but probably won’t
•
•
•

Page-hit counter. That could give us more information about what pages get used
and which ones don’t. We may do this later.
Wiki. That could provide good information – or not, like the famous/infamous
Wikipedia.
Reporter-assembled links lists – good in theory, but needs oversight by an editor or
researcher to assure quality/validity.

Things we don’t do but really hope to soon:
•

•
•
•

Hand over the intranet to the news researchers. We update our intranet sporadically,
as time permits. The intranet takes a back seat to every other project, etc., now.
News researchers must be trained in SQL Server/ASP and other Web-page building
skills, along with more database (Access) and spreadsheet skills.
Global searches of all databases for one name, etc.
More rankings, etc. of census data, others.
Interactive maps with census data, staffer locations for mobilizing in an emergency,
etc.
