Purpose of financial statements
●
Every three months, tell investors and other users where a company got its money, what it did
with it and where it is now
●
Give hints about future
●
Other users include lenders, regulators, competitors, customers, suppliers and anyone else who
uses information in the financial statements to make decisions
Finding financial statements
●
SEC’s ​EDGAR​ database (look for 10-Qs or 10-Ks)
●
Publicly traded companies are required to file financial statements at the end of each quarter, so
four times a year. The year-end financial statements cover the full year, including the last quarter
●
Takes a while to put them together and have auditors review them, so you might not see
financials filed until about two months after the quarter-end date
Format of financial statements
●
Management’s Discussion & Analysis
○
Place for the management team to explain their business, how they’re thinking about it
and expand on certain items of interest, especially if they have plans to address problem
areas or expect challenges ahead
●
Auditor’s report
○
Anything out of the ordinary should be taken seriously - more on that in Shortcut #1
●
Financial statements
○
Income statement
■
Show how much money a company made and spent over a period of time. Start
with revenue or sales, then list expenses. Net income is whatever is left over
○
Balance sheet
■
Show what a company owns and what it owes at a fixed point in time. Assets
less liabilities equals net worth
○
Statement of cash flows
■
Shows how money moves between a company and the outside world over a
period of time
○
Statement of changes in equity
■
Shows changes in the interests of the company’s shareholders over time
●
Notes to the financial statements
○
Where most of the good stuff is
○
Remember the racing horse named Read the Footnotes
Shortcut #1: Skim the auditor’s report
●
Auditors have to opine on both the financial statements and the company’s internal controls
●
Qualified (not good) or unqualified opinion
○
An unqualified opinion means the financial statements are reasonably stated or not
materially misstated
●
Control deficiencies (not good), adverse opinion (not good), emphasis of a matter (not always
bad), restatements (not good)
●
Note length of auditor relationship or change in auditor
Shortcut #2: Use earnings calls to zero in
●
What do executives spend their prepared remarks talking about?

●

What do analysts ask about? How do executives avoid answering?

Shortcut #3: Make financial statements’ limitations useful
●
Materiality thresholds
○
Rough rule of thumb is 5-10% of net income but varies by company
○
For large companies, that is hundreds of millions of dollars
●
Timing
○
Narrow down timeframes using period-end dates and subsequent events footnotes
●
Judgments
○
Be skeptical of the many things in financial statements that require management
judgment
Shortcut #4: Employ comparisons
●
Year-over-year or quarter compared to year-ago quarter values
○
Especially on balance sheet and income statement
●
Profitability and valuation compared to peers and sector averages
○
Could indicate poor management or takeover vulnerability
●
Changes in language
○
Most stays same by default
Shortcut #5: Glance at income statement
●
Significant changes in revenue
○
Revenue usually shouldn’t decrease for a growing business
●
Ballooning expenses
●
Restructuring expenses
○
Layoffs
●
Profit margins that differ drastically from peers
○
Net profit margin: Net income / revenue
○
NPM is a measure of much of your sales ends up as profit, or how efficiently the business
is run
●
Start-ups’ income statements will look very different because they’re intentionally spending a lot
to grow
Shortcut #6: Glance at balance sheet
●
Current vs. long-term
○
Current is something you expect to receive or pay within one year or less
●
Accounts receivable piling up suggests customers are taking longer to pay
●
Liabilities piling up or debt increasing to fund operations
Shortcut #7: Glance at statement of cash flows
● Do they have positive operating cash?
● Did any of the following adjustments significantly increase from prior years?
○ Inventory: Might be overrun with inventory, poor at forecasting
○ Accounts Receivable: Might be pressured to move inventory without prompt payment
○ Accounts Payable: Might be delaying payment of bills, cash-strapped
Shortcut #8: Check customer concentration footnote
●
Companies are required to disclose in notes if any individual customer accounts for more than
10% or more of its revenue or accounts receivable (sometimes they even ID by name)
●
Indicates when a company might be overly reliant on another company

Shortcut #9: Monitor related party business footnote
● Includes both companies and people
● Is revenue being propped up by related party transactions?
● Do arrangements raise questions about conflict of interest?
Shortcut #10: Scrutinize intangible assets footnote
● Goodwill records purchase premium
● Management and auditors test once a year for changes in value
○ If the value decreases, earnings will be hurt by an impairment expense
Shortcut #11: Read commitments and contingencies footnote
●
Reporters’ favorite note - details leases, debt payments and anything else it can’t get out of
●
Legal footnote
○
In order to accrue it needs to be probable and estimable, which is a high bar
Shortcut #12: Talk to the people involved
● CFO and financial reporting staff
● External auditors (for large companies, PwC, KPMG, Deloitte or EY)
○ Partners tend to specialize in industries
● Accounting academics
● Financial statement users looking for red flags such as analysts, investors, lenders and
competitors

or legal issues or settlement with an activist investor
● DEF 14-A
○ Annual proxy statement that includes business overview, executive compensation and
issues to be voted on at annual meeting
