Examining Prescribing Patterns in
Medicare

Medicare prescribing data
• Pharmaceutical companies purchase data
from middlemen, who purchase the data from
pharmacies.
• The middlemen would not sell it to
ProPublica.
• We requested the data from Medicare
because its Part D program pays for one of
every four prescriptions dispensed annually in
the U.S.

Medicare Part D is vast

Medicare prescribing data
• Prescribing data by provider ID from 2007 to
2010 (and later 2011)
• For each prescriber and drug:
– the total number of claims
– the retail cost of the drug (by brand and NDC)
– the days of supply
– the number of units (i.e. pills or ounces)

• Prescribing data for people 65+

Linking up the Part D data
• CMS NPI registration data (on CMS site) to
identify doctors
• DEA registered prescribers (from National
Technical Information Service) to identify
doctors that did not have NPI #s
• Data from First Databank to help us categorize
data into types of drugs
– (Ex: Lipitor = antihyperlipidemic)

Beyond the Part D data
• Data from American Geriatric Society on drugs
dangerous to seniors (Beers)
• Scraped drug information sites for top 500
• Data from ProPublica’s Dollars for Doctors
project to look at physicians who got money
from drug companies

What we found
Medicare’s failure to keep watch over Part D had
enabled:
• Inappropriate and risky prescribing
• Billions of dollars in waste
• Fraud to flourish
We also found clear signs that doctors who had
relationships with pharmaceutical companies
prescribed more name-brand drugs

What we found

Marrying the databases

The beta blocker Bystolic

Prescribing data limitations
• In some cases, prescriptions from other
physicians within a clinic or practice were
attributed to one physician.
• In some cases, pharmacies entered the wrong
NPI number.
• In some cases, prescriptions were attributed
to “dummy” prescribers.

Other prescribing data
• State Medicaid prescription data
• Veteran’s Administration
