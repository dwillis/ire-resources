Judging the judicial system
NICAR Conference, Charlotte, March 23, 2003

In their series, “Justice Delayed, Justice Denied,” CJ Reporters
R.G. Dunlop and Jason Riley examined the judicial system in Bullitt
County, Kentucky. The series took six months and involved sorting
through thousands of court files and building a database to track
cases.
Among their findings: Prosecutors allowed at least 220 felony
cases to lay dormant, some for as long as two decades; a murder
defendant was allowed to remain on bond for 17 years; at least two
dozen defendants were arrested again while old cases against them
continued to languish; some defendants offered to plead guilty but
prosecutors never followed through.

Here are things to keep in mind if you do something similar:
Look for signs the system isn't working
• What are the ratios of pending to closed cases compared to other
jurisdictions? An unusually high number of pending cases may be a
sign that something is wrong.
• Is there a system to follow-up on cases? Are cases automatically
re-docketed if they are continued? If not, cases may be slipping
through the cracks.
• Does the record keeping seem haphazard or disorganized?
• What do the players in the system say? Lawyers may be upfront
about how they take advantage of the system's lapses. Judges may
be upset with disorganized or slow-moving prosecutors.
Examine the process on its own terms
• If the case was waived to the grand jury, did the grand jury hear
the case?
• If the grand jury returned an indictment, was the defendant
arraigned?
• If the defendant was arraigned, has there been any action on the
case since?
• If a guilty plea was offered, was it accepted?
• If a defendant pleaded guilty, was he or she sentenced?
• If the defendant was sentenced, did the defendant complete the
sentence?
A database can help you organize
• If you can get your hands on the court system’s database, you may
be able to quickly summarize case outcomes. That may tell you
whether there's a potential story there or not.
• In our case, there was no database, so we had to examine every
case file. A handmade database helps you track the cases and know
which you have checked and haven't checked.
• The computer helps you spot trends: Which prosecutor has the most
old cases? Which lawyers? Which judges?

Be careful
• Don't assume because the computer says a case is open, it is.
• Don't assume because the court file appears to show the case is
open, it is.
• We gave the prosecutor a list from our database of cases we
believed to be open. He was able to show us some had been closed,
although the official records said they were open.
