Investigating disability issues: 0 to 60
Brian M. Rosenthal, The New York Times

The Michael Berens checklist

Covering disability issues generally, and
special education specifically, is complicated
It is…
• Sensitive
• Stigmatized
• Very different in different cities/states
• Governed by a bunch of legal issues
So… consult experts
• Advocates, researchers, lobbyists, current and former front-line employees,
and, most of all, current and former regulators
• If it’s a local issue, state regulators can be your best friend
• If it’s a state issue, federal regulators can be your best friend
• If it’s a federal issue, local/state regulators can be your best friend

What to ask the experts
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

What do you think of the tip?
Is this a local story, a state story, a regional story or a national story?
What should I know before investigating this tip?
Where would you start your investigation into this tip?
Who would you talk to about this tip?
What the major issues in this area?
Where does this tip fit into those issues?
Has there been a lot of reporting about this? Is anyone else looking into it?
What should my reporting question be?*

*Good reporting is driven by questions. Pick a question that you want to
answer in your investigation, and latch onto it.

If you have time and space, start by
trying to DISPROVE the tip
• It will pay off in all kinds of ways…
• It will protect you from yourself
• It will teach you how to speak the language
• It will allow you to discover countless interesting details
• It will start you off on the right foot with every source
• It will improve your odds of getting records
• It will help you build your case
• It will enable you to speak more authoritatively
• And when you get to the interviews that count, you’ll know what
you’re talking about

But plan ahead
•
•
•
•

Records requests take time, so put them in early
Data obtaining and analyzing takes time, so start it early
Finding the perfect source(s) takes time, so begin searching early
Writing takes time, so start it early*

*At least start an outline as soon as possible
(Yes, I know it’s hard. Do it anyway)

Where to look
• Data, data, data
– Special ed evaluations, entries, exits, test scores, seclusion, discipline...
– Obtain it from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), from the
Office of Special Ed Programs (OSEP), state ed department, local districts
– Slice it by region, district, school, disability type, age, race, gender

• Reports filed each year by states and districts
– Ask feds/state for “Annual Performance Report” and “State Performance
Plan”

• Lawsuits
– Look for cases filed by parents against local school districts

• Human sources
– Parents, advocates, special ed teachers, tutors, therapists, counselors,
diagnosticians, general ed teachers, principals, special ed directors,
superintendents, regulators (federal/state), policymakers
