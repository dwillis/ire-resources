Covering transborder issues
when you don’t live near the
border
Daniel Connolly, The (Memphis) Commercial Appeal.
IRE Orlando, 2011

Getting started
-Speaking Spanish will help.
-Being patient will help, too.

A project blueprint: explaining
the role of illegal immigrants
in a local industry
Issues: exploitation of immigrants,
competition with local workers,
safety.

A quick investigation: the
international driver’s license

-It’s sold openly.
-Businesses may accept
it as ID.
-It’s not legitimate.

A project blueprint: Writing a profile
of an international drug trafficker in
your community
Most communities across the U.S. have some
link to Mexican organized crime.
Life stories of traffickers help illustrate
economic and social realities.

Travel grants
• See a full list in the tipsheet or the Spring
2011 IRE Journal article.
• Keep your application as focused as
possible.

-Drug proceeds
from your area
may flow
directly to
Mexico.
-Most drug users
in the U.S. are
white.
- Readers are
often
interested in
the legalization
question.

Ethics for transborder stories
• Information in stories can lead to deportation,
imprisonment or death.
• Make sure the key people in your news
organization know the stakes. Have a discussion
early about names, other issues.
• Seek an opportunity to review everything once
more before it goes out.
