Finding Watchdog and Investigative Ideas
Mining key documents for a steady stream of tips, stories
•

Inspection reports: Grocery stores and restaurants, hospitals, nursing homes,
swimming pools, gym hot tubs (usually available from state or county health
departments); zoos, animal parks, horse shows (available from USDA’s Animal
and Plant Health Inspection Service,
http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_welfare/index.shtml); amusement park rides,
escalators, elevators (available from state labor department in some states),
workplace safety (construction accidents, manufacturing plants, etc, OSHA:
http://www.osha.gov/oshstats/index.html) etc.

•

Warning letters, citations and regulatory orders: Useful in identifying problem
companies or individuals. Some places to find them: State professional licensing
boards for pharmacists, doctors, dentists, nurses, auctioneers, private detectives,
security agencies, athletic trainers, barbers, cosmetologists, air conditioning
contractors, funeral service workers, engineers, dieticians, professional
counselors, marriage counselors, social workers, veterinarians, plumbers,
physical therapists, massage therapists, landscape architects, low voltage alarm
contractors, optometrists, opticians, speech pathologists, audiologists, home
inspectors, etc (an example from Georgia:
http://sos.georgia.gov/plb/PublicOrders/PublicBoardOrdersByProfessionAndYear
.aspx); local/county code enforcement violation notices (rats/vermin). Federal
agency warning letters can yield trend stories and local angles. Some places to
find them: FDA:
http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/default.htm

•

Incident Reports: Think beyond police reports. What other agencies respond to
reports of people in trouble? Do they keep incident reports or data? An example:
Georgia parks have incident reports involving injuries, crimes and other incidents
in state parks. http://tinyurl.com/6xo5em7

•

Fines and punishments: These documents/data can yield stories about how
active an agency is in regulating entities and potentially how effective (or
ineffective) it is in protecting the public. Are total fines up or down over time?
How do the amounts of fines imposed compare with what was actually collected?

•

Consumer or user complaints: Can help quantify an issue, provide tips and
real people for a story. Some examples: CPSC’s new complaint database:
http://www.saferproducts.gov/; NHTSA vehicle, tire and child car seat complaints:
http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/complaints/; state consumer protection agency or
Attorney General’s consumer protection division; local BBB, national charity
watchdogs and consumer groups, including Consumers Union, Charity
Navigator, state Long-Term Care Ombudsmen, state insurance commissioners
(consumer complaints on rates, claims handling practices, www.naic.org), etc.

•

Government audits and inspector general reports: State auditor reports on
state/local agencies – but don’t neglect federal audits/IG reports when looking for
local stories. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services OIG (includes
audits of local public health programs, bioterrorism funding:
http://oig.hhs.gov/reports-and-publications/index.asp, look at reports by both the
Office of Audit Services and the Office of Evaluation and Inspections).U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs OIG (includes inspections of local/regional VA
facilities/clinics, evaluations of delays or inaccurate processing of disability and
other claims, benefit issues: http://www.va.gov/oig/publications/reports-list.asp);
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (Includes issues with
administering federal housing funds and assistance; lists audits by state:
http://www.hudoig.gov/reports/externalaudits.php ); U.S. Department of
Agriculture (http://www.usda.gov/oig/rptsaudits.htm); U.S. Department of the
Interior OIG (includes issues involving the National Parks Service, U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service (including audits of grants to states):
http://www.doioig.gov/reports/report-database); U.S. Department of Education
OIG (includes audits of state administration of programs and funds,
http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/oig/reports.html)

•

After-Action Reports: Most government agencies do some sort of look-back to
evaluate their performance after a significant event or drill. The reports are
sometimes called “after-action reports” and they detail lessons learned, what
worked, what didn’t and recommendations for improvement in the future.

•

Perks: Look for records on government agencies or charities paying for such
things as cars, travel, private jets, bonuses, paid education leave, and other
perks. Check out government-issued credit card bills.

Key Elements of a good watchdog or investigative story
• Tells readers or viewers something they didn’t know.
• Reveals something the subjects would prefer remain secret.
• Alerts the public to danger or wrongdoing.
• It’s timely: There’s a reason readers or viewers will be interested in it right now.
• It involves compelling characters.
• The story is sharply focused.
• There is a way to quantify the problem.
• Documents or data exist that help take the story deeper.
Developing an eye for investigative story ideas
• Read everything with investigations in mind: Are you seeing any patterns or
trends? Are there disparities? Is an incident particularly compelling or outrageous
– and is it an example of something larger? Read everything: Not just
newspapers and magazines, but also look at press releases, trade journals,
blogs, product recalls and government reports, looking for possible
investigations. Set up RSS feeds and get on listservs relating to areas of interest.
Keep an ideas file with links or excerpts of items that seem interesting (or have a
handy box or folder to stash clippings or printouts with your notes of why they
caught your attention).
• Know the rules of the game. When something happens, question whether those
involved did what they were supposed to do. Get the rule book (such as a
government manual, response plan, employee training guide). What does it say
should have happened? How does that compare with what actually happened?
