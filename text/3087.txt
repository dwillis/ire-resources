Navigating the Social Network Minefield
Why Every Journalist Should Care:
y 128 million Americans log on everyday
y 16% of adults use online social networking sites
y 55% of teens use online social networking sites
Social Network Hints:
y Sign up and explore sites (you’ll find some cool stuff)
y Know what information is available (profiles, blogs, pictures, videos, email)
y Create “work” profile (separate from your personal profile)
y Don’t make it hard (choose settings that allow others to contact you easily)
y Network (join some local groups)
How Can You Use Material from the Internet:
y Confirm any information with other sources
y Get permission if possible
y Incorporate the website into the story
y Shoot the monitor showing the web site with the clip
Mines to Avoid:
y Don’t use a tight shot of a photo or video from a web site
y Don’t make the image into a graphic so that it looks like your photo
y Don’t add “Courtesy of…” when you haven’t gotten permission. It has no
legal value.

Questions in the Minefield:
y How do you know who really posted the information?
y How do you know it is NOT someone posing as this person?
y How do you know it is even remotely accurate?
y Is this copyrighted material or fair use?
y Is this considered private verses public on the WORLDWIDE web?

Tiptoeing Through the Minefield:
y Use Social Network Sites as any other research tool and background material
y Think MySpace, Facebook, Flickr, YouTube whenever stumped on a story
y Verify, Verify, Verify
y At the very least sign up or know someone in newsroom who is member of
MySpace, YouTube, Facebook
y The law is only now forming around many of these issues

Final Thoughts:
y There are big risks as well as rewards
y Anyone can post anything on these sites
y It’s up to you to confirm
y What may appear to be “Fair Use” may NOT be
y Ownership and Copyright Issues play role
