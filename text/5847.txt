Tip 1: Quick ways to debunk economic impact promises!
●

Common deceptions & economic tricks used:
○

Grouping temporary construction jobs with permanent jobs

○

Exaggerating “ripple effect” jobs. Anything more than 1.5 indirect jobs on top of 1.0 direct job
(i.e., those at the subsidized company) is facially suspect

○

Counting recirculated money as new money

○

Conveniently forgetting basic economic principles, such as displacement, or the fact that
induced growth creates new public-sector costs for education, safety, sanitation, roads, etc.

○

Unrealistic job-creation promises & salary averages

○

Comparing apples to oranges: e.g., juxtaposing tax breaks with payroll and/or capital
expenditures. But the latter do not equal tax revenue, so no, tax breaks seldom “pay for
themselves”

○

Your local university should have an economic professor who can debunk the claims of
marketing firms and politicians pretty quickly

●

●

Where to find this story:
○

Super Bowls, sporting events, new stadiums, convention centers, warehouses, data centers

○

Grand municipal projects

○

Sometimes it doesn’t take much to debunk the BS

Tip 2: What your community can do better on economic subsidies!
●

Many businesses have extremely specific needs--specialized talent pools, transportation
infrastructure to fully address a labor market, proximity to customers and/or key inputs such as
graduate schools. Business basics almost always drive location decisions; incentives rarely do.
○

Many experts predicted Crystal City in Northern Virginia would be where HQ2 would land
because of the skills Amazon needed, the real estate and development requirements it had,
multiple transit linkages, etc--and indeed it’s where Amazon ended up

●

Local officials are “structurally buffaloed,” terribly inexperienced, and generally terrible at
negotiations.

●

Are the subsidies offered the best use of incentives and/or tax dollars? Did your gov’t even research
the question?

●

A more strategic “cluster strategy” for tech development avoids putting lots of eggs in any one
corporate basket (“megadeals”) and instead focuses on creating an ecosystem of talent, education
and technical assistance that benefits many promising young companies: Column: Cities need to
stop selling out to big tech companies. There's a better way

●

Does the type of employer match local development goals or the reality of local employment and
skills? Many cities that spent big to lure HQ2 never had a chance.

●

Are they subsidizing a retail business with low wages (i.e. sports) instead of high-wage industry?

●

Are there clawbacks if the corporation fails to meet its goals? Penalties? Are there mechanisms to
measure?https://buffalonews.com/2019/04/10/cuomo-tesla-on-track-state-will-impose-penalty-if-promises-arent-met/

●

Is the community falling for a celebrity pitchman like David Beckham (Miami) or Elon Musk (Buffalo)
or Denzel Washington (Massachusetts)?
○

Politicians are not only just completely outmatched business-wise, but they also tend to get enamored with the
hyperbolic myths surrounding tech leaders or Hollywood figures, which can lead to insane concessions premised
almost entirely on the magical hope that these deals will somehow transform the local community into some

●

Why are they subsidizing a project that was going to happen anyway?
$100M tax benefit for a project that had been planned for years

Tip 3: Key sources & documents for debunking economic BS!
●

Get the “study” cited, full report, & all statistical backup: was it done by economist? What is their
history? Who paid for it?

●

Make the author(s) state all of the underlying assumptions used in the input-output computations,
such as: what percent of the job takers will be incumbent residents versus in-migrants? (That goes to

the induced growth question.) What share of business inputs will be supplied by in-state firms? What
share of new job takers will actually reside on the state? (Tesla is close to California; Foxconn is
close to Illinois. Half the HQ2 finalist cities would’ve drawn commuters from 2 to 4 states, as in
DMV.)
●

Cherry-picked non-economists often do the reports:
wtsp.com/article/news/local/floridas-leading-economist-on-sporting-events-isnt-an-economist/67-430762146

●

MOUs and proposals can be public via records requests and state websites and can reveal tons of
great details.
○

The NYC detailed proposal for HQ2 showed how much valuable information Amazon got
from the cities pursuing the project. See also: https://www.muckrock.com/project/americabids-on-amazon-175/

●

Ask for drafts of the deals & MOUs, and/or emails between negotiators to see how much the
corporations had the nerve to ask for, and how hard your gov’t pushed back against demands:
wtsp.com/article/news/investigations/secret-spring-training-documents-provide-insight-on-braves-sarasota-negotiations/67-406146162

●

Don’t let them get away with “proprietary business information” exemptions - your audience will find it
shady too.
○

If the proposals aren’t public record, write about that and call them out! There will be
backlash.

○
●

Companies and municipalities don’t fight to keep boring records hidden.

What’s the actual cost? Often way more than you were told. There are lots of hidden costs
conveniently forgotten.

●

What’s been promised? Often outrageous amounts.

●

Internal docs from the companies - ironic how meticulous they are internally on production goals,
workers per manufacturing line, etc...yet when they deal with public officials, suddenly their math is
incredibly vague

●

Don’t wait until the deal is done! Start asking questions and requesting documents now:
○

Stadium negotiations start around 10th or 12th year of building’s existence; almost always by
15th or 20th year

○

Emails, meetings with executives or lobbyists, draft versions of leases

○

Your stories can help prevent politicians from getting swindled:

○

Site selection documents & bond research will reveal what major projects a municipality is
considering:

Tip 4: All the different ways your community will offer up (hidden) subsidies
●

There are dozens of different subsidies politicians will offer up, claiming they aren’t tax dollars...but
they are. They’ll claim they couldn’t go toward other things...but they often could.

●

Companies can get taxpayers or ratepayers to pay for things like energy infrastructure at data
centers to road construction near a warehouses

●

Most subsidies are fungible!

●

What other community needs could have been met with those monies?
○

●

This is how to find real life people for your stories!

What’s the opportunity cost lost by pursuing this priority instead of others?
○

This helps you tell the story for Tip No. 5:

Tip 5: Countering the argument that giving biz incentives is better than no jobs at all
●

Illinois called ADM’s bluff and still it relocated its HQ to Chicago, not out of state.

●

Toyota twice took smaller than competing package offers to locate a truck plant and its North
American HQ in Texas. Toyota-Mazda did the same choosing Alabama over North Carolina in 2018.

●

What’s the opportunity cost lost by pursuing this priority instead of others?

●

Look at wages of promised jobs, cost per permanent job

●

Look at data center deals (capital-intensive, no deep talent pool, cheap electricity & water)

●

For every winner, there is a loser - who are the losers? Who didn’t get subsidies for doing similar
work? Which companies may suffer because the government is subsidizing its competitors?

●

Which public services might be stressed by the growth of the new company & employees?
○

Wisc. determined FOXCONN deal would not see ROI until 2042-43 at best...so why did it agree to lose money per
job for the next 20 years?

●

Which public services won’t be funded because of the subsidies? For more on that, see info on
GASB Statement 77 on Tax Abatement Disclosures at www.goodjobsfirst.org/gasb

●

What’s the true cost and true ROI to the community?

●

What price will the local community pay? Not everyone will be excited about the new business:

How much was spent putting deal together in the first place? Hearings, negotiations, staff time, etc?

What price is too high for that deal? Louisiana spent billions on film subsidies & paid a huge price..

Tip 6: Debunking economic impact promises after a company starts getting money
●

Check old press releases, press conferences, & campaign speeches to see if promises are getting
delivered.

●

If it isn’t guaranteed in writing, corporation won’t feel compelled to deliver:
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-02/foxconn-struggles-to-put-wisconsin-first

●

What standards for job creation and job quality do the major state subsidy programs have?
https://www.goodjobsfirst.org/moneyforsomething

●

Even when it is in the contract, keep an eye on how things change, and don’t let the company dictate
success metrics.

○

Foxconn has changed its factory size, job makeup, factory timeline, etc, with zero penalty to the company...yet
politicians continue citing economic analyses/ROIs for a plan that no longer exists.

○

The Foxconn package has enormous fixed costs (land parceling, water, sewer, roads) that don’t go away even if the
jobs don’t materialize (and the state doesn’t pay out much because those dollars are tied to performance over time).

○

Nate Jensen at UT-Austin showed in Texas, a quarter of projects in their main incentive program were renegotiated
after the deal was announced, making it easier for the companies to get breaks. Similar issues in NY. In California,
an Amazon warehouse deal was later amended to have fewer initial employees, therefore making it easier to hit their
“new jobs” target.

●

Set reminders for 1yr, 2yr, 5yr follow-ups (save those press releases)

●

Are developers meeting the transparency & reporting metrics they promised?

●

Use tax receipts to see if promised “huge impact” events actually did anything
○

Analysis showed 2017 CFB championship had virtually no impact on tax receipts

○

Analysis showed 2012 RNC actually hurt local economy, despite $400M claims

Tip 7: The next frontier - opportunity zones!
●

The new Trump-era incentives exist in virtually every news market in the U.S.

●

Designed to stimulate growth in low-income census tracts...but did your community choose to designate
areas connected to politically-influential developers instead? Were the zones already gentrifying between
the 2010 census and the 2018 designations? The process was a political one, so you can get them from
your local governments & states.
○

●

Most of Portland’s core was designated: www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-portland-opportunity-zones/

Is your local community using these zones the way they were ostensibly intended? Who is forming the
Opportunity Zone investment funds? Will they accelerate gentrification?
○

Scaramucci on a project in Oakland: “For those of you who have yet to go to Oakland, California, or that
part of the Bay Area, I can tell you that it’s fully gentrifying. Oakland is effectively becoming the Brooklyn
Heights of San Francisco,” Scaramucci said. “We think we’re going to be building a swank, boutique hotel
there that’s going to create excessive economic rents for the REIT.”

●

Miami Herald-Tribune: “Under certain circumstances, sellers can avoid all capital-gains taxes, savings that
can mean millions of dollars in windfalls for investors and a loss of the same dollars for the federal
government.”

●

Are these federal tax dollars just subsidizing projects that were happening anyway? What’s the benefit of
the public spending?
