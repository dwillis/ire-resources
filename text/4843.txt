General resources:
*Your state and local comptroller’s office. Also remember that the comptroller is often elected so it can
also be a political post.
*Think tanks like Good Jobs or your state or local budget watchdogs.
*Development groups, like the Council of Development Finance Agencies, which often have state-specific
sections:

*Bond lawyers, real estate developers, site selectors, business groups.
Understanding municipal bonds:
*“Handbook for Muni-Bond Issuers” by Joe Mysak
This thin little blue book is the simplest, most readable breakdown of municipal bonds I’ve seen.
*EMMA – for bond prices, interest rates, trading information, financial disclosures to bondholders and past
bond documents. Free access with sign-up.
http://emma.msrb.org/
*Access preliminary official statements for upcoming bond sales on these sites (or ask your state or local
issuer where they publish their bond prospectus documents):
https://www.munios.com/ (In some cases including extremely informative Road Shows)
http://www.i-dealprospectus.com/PublicSite/wfProspectusMain.aspx
http://www.emuni.org/
http://www.mcelweequinn.com/
http://www.munideals.com/deals.php
http://fmhub.com/
(These documents can be good for scoops on new developments in your area including litigation or
settlements, underfunded pensions, swaps disclosures, biggest employers, etc. All are free, some require
sign-up. In MuniOS you can sign up for alerts so that you’ll be among the first to know your city is
planning to sell bonds soon.)
