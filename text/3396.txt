Downloadable data
Besides searchable databases, there are plenty of places you can go to download information so you can
analyze it on your own in a spreadsheet or database manager. Here are some places to get this kind of
data (Note: Look for key words on government sites such as: Excel, .xls, download, database, etc.):


Census data - query and download results factfinder.census.gov/servlet/DatasetMainPageServlet?_lang=en&_ts=262968313843&_ds_name=
ACS_2007_3YR_G00_&_program=



Census download center - factfinder.census.gov/servlet/DownloadDatasetServlet?_lang=en



Nursing Home Compare data download from Medicare.gov www.medicare.gov/Download/DownloadDB.asp



FRA data download - safetydata.fra.dot.gov/OfficeofSafety/publicsite/downloads/downloads.aspx



MSHA accident and incident data download www.msha.gov/STATS/PART50/p50y2k/p50y2k.HTM



FBI Uniform Crime Reports download spreadsheets - www.fbi.gov/ucr/ucr.htm#cius



Federal firearms licensees from the ATF - www.atf.gov/statistics/ffl-list.html

Advanced search strategies
You can also use advanced searches in Google to find data. Check out this guide to Google searching with
the advanced form - www.googleguide.com/sharpening_queries.html:
 Search by file type: example – filetype:xls
 Search by domain: example – site:.gov
 Search by url: example – allinurl: ftp

Some folks have been asking me what the different file extensions mean. Here’s a quick cheat sheet (Note:
If you find an extension that you can’t identify, just google “File extension .xxx” where “xxx” is the
extension):
 Spreadsheet file
o .xls – older versions of Excel
o .xlsx – 2007 version of Excel
o .ods – Open Office Calc
 Database file
o .mdb – older versions of Access
o .accdb – 2007 version of Access
o .dbf - common database file
 Text files
o .txt
o .csv – comma separated value
o .lst – usually a text file containing a list
o .dat – data file
 PDF files - .pdf
 PowerPoint files - .ppt for older versions and .pptx for 2007 version.

Fun with URLs
Once you discover data online from a government agency, be sure to pay close attention to the URL. For
example, the following link provides a download of an Excel spreadsheet with federal contracts relating to
Haiti earthquake relief:
https://www.fpds.gov/downloads/top_requests/Haiti_Earthquake_Report.xls
Notice key parts of the URL: “downloads” and “top_requests”
If you paste this link into your browser and simply delete the URL a section or two, you might find more
data from the FPDS. For example, if you back the link above one section you get this:

https://www.fpds.gov/downloads/top_requests/
It takes you to a page with the top requests from the Federal Procurement Data System. It includes
hurricanes Katrina and Rita contracts, top 100 contractors by fiscal year, and more.

Mining map services
Some believe GIS data should and will be free.




Web 2.0 Geoservers will make GIS knowledge widely available for mashups.
Open standards, RESTful interfaces, and formats like kml, georss & json, will make the
data, etc readily exchangeable.

We may not be there yet. But
whenever you see an interactive map
on the Web, there may be a map
service that also is being published.

Take this example, at
http://www.maps.
unc.edu/uncmaps/default.aspx. The
map is zoomed into the front of the JSchool building, & a maple tree is
selected. It’s based on an ArcIMS map service

In ArcMap, you can add a
GIS Server for the url
domain. Then you’ll see
all the available map
services, and their layers.





The attribute table for
the map service tree
layer has columns not
available through the
Web map.
You can use ArcMap
tools to do searches
not available on the Web version.
You can export data.

Respect customary Web-scraping courtesies. Don’t download
too much or too fast.

Another kind of map service can be explored through a
browser. You can see info on layers & attributes. Preview
layers. Query layers, if allowed. Get query results in kml or
json.

To find map services: Try a Web map domain. Use View |
Source to look for URLs. Use Firebug to spot map services being queried.
