There are a lot of opinions on being a “good” coder
Contrary to popular stock photo lore, you do not need to be a white
man with glasses to be a good coder.
No matter how good you are your code will never jump out of your
computer and appear virtually before you.
Coding will never transform you into a rockstar or ninja.

You already know so much more than you think you do
Yes, code might mean:
unfamiliar syntax(!)
foreign programs(!!)
new and different interactions with your computer(!!!)
But...
Coding is fundamentally about logic and problem solving, which you’re probably
already pretty good at!

Coding is a team sport
Ah, yes, here we observe the lone coder
genius is his natural environment.

A large part of what’s actually happening:
●

Googling “how do I…?”

●

Stack Overflow-ing error messages

●

Copying and pasting pieces of someone
else’s code

Good code: maybe not what you think
Code is a tool that lets you do a thing. If your code does the thing then it’s successful.
Good code:
●
●
●

Works.
Is well-documented.
Is proudly displayed on Github.

Good code may not be the most efficient or have fancy functions, but it builds the thing and
that can be enough.

Mistakes will be made
Mistakes happen to everyone. I asked some veteran coding friends to share:
Spent a full day debugging an
API call. I had put `reprots`
instead of `reports.`

I made this?

Deleted an essential table
from a database on last day of
an internship. Don’t work
sleep deprived.

Everything goes wrong every
time I work with time zones.

Took down a whole website by
misplacing the closing html tag

Debugging forever only to find
I had fat fingered an ‘o’ instead
of zero.
