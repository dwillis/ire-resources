The Elaboration Model is a systematic method for analyzing the effects of other variables on an
initially significant relationship. Overall, it gives journalists a better understanding of how and why the
initial relationship works and how other variables affect it. Many variables are likely to affect a
relationship in social science, and the model helps journalists assess their effects. As Philip Meyer points
out in the Third Edition of Precision Journalism: A Reporter’s Introduction to Social Science Methods,
“Nothing happens in the real world without multiple causes, and the simplified models that we use to
understand it can mislead us if we are not careful (Page 131).” Meyer calls these other variables “lurking
variables.”
For example, if a teachers’ group alleges gender discrimination, a journalist would obtain the
data and assess whether salaries differed by gender. If salaries differ significantly by gender, the two
variables are related. The results would initially support a difference in salaries based on gender.
Because only two variables are involved in the analysis, journalists would assume gender, the
independent variable or presumed cause, directly affected salaries, the dependent variable or what is
measured (Gender > Salary).
But other variables, such as level of education, years of experience, and supervision of
extracurricular activities like coaching, are likely to affect the relationship between gender and salary.
“Then you try to figure out what besides straightforward causation might account for it (Page 131),”
Meyer explains. Assessing these variables might provide more support for a direct effect between
gender and salary. But it also might indicate a more complex relationship between gender, salary and the
other variables. Moreover, the analysis could indicate that gender and salary are not related at all, but
they only appear to be connected because they are both related to another prior variable. The effect is
called spurious because the relationship between the initial two variables, gender and salary, would be
false. Thus, the analysis would have helped save the journalist from reaching the wrong conclusion.
How does a journalist know which variables are likely to have an effect? Morris Rosenberg in
his book The Logic of Survey Analysis says they are usually “block-booking” variables. Movie
marketers previously required theaters to buy movies in a block that included less desirable movies with
a blockbuster. If they wanted the blockbuster, the theaters had to purchase the entire package. Blockbooking variables are variables commonly associated with the variables in the analysis, ethnicity and
salary.
If the initial relationship is significant – salary varied significantly by gender or an about 10 %
difference in column percentages – another variable such as level of education would be added to the
analysis and its effect assessed. The new variable is commonly called a control variable because the
journalist is controlling its influence by including it in the analysis. The journalist would examine the
relationship between gender and salary over the levels of the control variable, such as for high school or
less and some college or more. The Elaboration Model would be used to assess the results of the
analysis.
Three outcomes are possible:
• The effect is the same as the initial relationship. (Replication)
• The effect disappears. (Explanation or Interpretation)
• The effect differs over the categories of the control variable. (Specification)
Replication
The first possible outcome is called replication. It occurs when all of the results are statistically
significant, and the values are similar to the initial relationship. Thus, the original results have been
replicated.
Two possible relationships could account for these results, depending on whether the control
variable (education) came before or after the independent variable. If the control variable occurred
after the independent variable (Gender > Education > Salary), the findings support a direct relationship
2

(Gender > Salary) between the variables because the control variable had no effect. If the control
variable (education) had an effect, the relationship would have disappeared because controlling
education (Gender > Education > Salary) would have broken the causal chain.
The second possibility is the control variable occurred before (prior, or antecedent) the
independent variable (Education > Gender > Salary). Thus, the effect of education on salary would be
indirect: Education affects gender, which in turn affects salary. Use logic and prior research to determine
the time/order of the variables.
In our example, it is obvious that education came after gender, which supports the first
explanation and a direct effect between gender and salary. The more we get similar results when we
assess the influence other variables, the more support we will have that gender directly affects salaries
and the stronger the case for gender discrimination. If the results with variables show different results,
the relationship is more complex.
If we are uncertain about the order of the variables or to confirm our interpretation, a second test
must be conducted with independent variable as the control variable (Education > Gender > Salary). If
the relationship disappears or is greatly reduced, the results support a prior control variable and an
indirect relationship. The significant effect disappears because the independent variable is an essential
link in the causal chain (CV > IV > DV) and controlling for it removes its influence, thus breaking the
chain. However, if the test is significant, it supports a direct effect between the independent and
dependent variables.
Explanation or Interpretation
Two possibilities also exist if none of the relationships is statistically significant: explanation or
interpretation. To determine which applies, assess the time-order of the variables. If the control variable
occurred before both original variables, the relationship is spurious (Education > Gender; Education >
Salary). Both variables are related to the control variable but NOT to each other. When the influence of
the control variable is controlled, no connection exists between the independent and dependent variable
so the relationship disappears. Spurious means false. The outcome is called explanation because it
explains away the initial significant finding.
The classic example of a spurious relationship is the relationship between the number of storks
and the number of babies. As the number of storks increases, the number of babies increases. This
statement is true, but storks obviously do not cause babies. Both variables are related to a prior
condition: rural areas. Storks prefer the rural habitat, and rural mothers have more children. The
relationship disappears when geography is controlled.
If the control variable occurs after the independent variable, the findings support interpretation
and an indirect relationship between the variables (Gender > Education > Salary). It happens when the
independent variable influences the control variable, which in turn influences the dependent variable.
The relationship disappears because controlling for control variable breaks the causal chain. The control
variable is often called an intervening or mediating variable because it comes between the independent
and dependent variables. The outcome is called interpretation because it helps the journalist interpret the
way in which the control variable works.
Like with replication, the results of the tests will be the same for both spurious and intervening
relationships. The journalist must determine whether the control variable occurred before or after the
independent variable. If you are uncertain about order or to confirm your interpretation, conduct a test
between the independent variable and the control variable (Gender > Education), which would serve as
a dependent variable. This test confirms the first part of the causal chain (IV > CV > DV). If the test is
significant, the relationship is indirect and supports interpretation. If the test is NOT significant, the
relationship is spurious.

Specification
Specification is the final outcome, and the easier one to interpret. It occurs when the tests yield
different results over the values of the control variable. Thus, the relationship between gender and salary
might be significant for less than high school but not for some college or more. However, it is possible
for both to be significant for different reasons.
This outcome is called specification because it specifies the conditions under which the original
relationship holds. It is also called an interaction because the control variable is interacting with the
independent variable, resulting in changes in the dependent variable over the levels of the independent
variable.
The following chart can help you assess the effects of the control variable on the initial
relationship between gender and salary.

This chart can help you use the Elaboration Model to interpret the results of the partial chi-square
tests (or about a 10 % difference in column percentages). A partial test only involves one level of the
control variable, such as the relationship between gender and salary for High School or Less. SPSS
statistical software conducts a partial test for each level of the control variable. Follow these steps in
interpreting the chart:
1. Go to Partials row under Test and determine whether all the partial chi-squares are significant,
none are significant, or the effects are mixed. If they are mixed, the results support
specification and an interaction.
2. If they are all significant or none significant, you must determine whether the control variable
occurred before or after the independent variable. Then, go to the Control Variable row and
select the appropriate determination. Use the interpretation below your selection.
3. If you are uncertain about whether the control variable came before or after the independent
variable or if you want to confirm your interpretation. Conduct the second chi-square test that is
specified in the interpretation below your selection.

STEP 1: INITIAL ANALYSIS
You must first establish that the initial variables are related. If they are related, one variable
affects the other. We will use the Chi-Square Test of Independence. It is primarily used when the
independent and dependent variables are measured at the nominal level, i.e. name only and no order.
The test can be used with ordinal data, i.e. has a vague order such as high, medium and low, but the test
treats ordinal data as nominal. However, the Elaboration Model can also be used with column
percentages on pivot or cross-tabulation tables and the most commonly used inferential statistical tests,
including t-tests, One-Way Analysis of Variance, factorial Analysis of Variance and regression.
We will examine whether ethnicity affects how often people follow civic affairs, and we will use
data from the General Social Survey. Ethnicity is the independent variable (presumed cause), and it has
two categories, or levels: White (1) and Black (2). The dependent variable (what is measured) is Follow
Civic Affairs. It measures how frequently the peole follow civic affairs, and it has three levels: Seldom
(1) Some of the Time (2) and Most of the Time (3). When we apply the Elaboration Model in the
second part of the analysis, we will use two variables, Gender and Education, that could affect the
relationship between ethnicity and following civic affairs. More variables could be added.
In the first part of the analysis, we will examine column percentages using a cross-tabulation table to
get a basic understanding of the data. Generally, if the difference between the column percentages is
about 10 % or greater, it is likely to be statistically significant, which means the difference is unlikely to
have occurred by chance or random variation. We must conduct the Chi-Square test to be sure. (You can
also compare column percentages using pivot tables in Microsoft Excel. Actually, you can conduct the
Chi-Square analysis as well using the Analysis ToolPak as an Add-In under the Tools pulldown menu.)
By convention, the independent variable always goes in the columns and the dependent variable always
goes in the rows. Follow these steps to get the column percentages in SPSS 16. The procedure in other
versions of SPSS may vary slightly.
1. Go to the Analyze pulldown menu, select Descriptive Statistics and then Crosstabs.
2. The independent variable always goes in the Columns, so the journalist can interpret the data
across Columns. Click on Ethnic and then the arrow by Column(s).
3. The dependent variable always goes in the Rows. Click on Follow Civic Affairs and then the
arrow by Row(s).
4. Click on Cells.
5. Go to Percentages and check Column. Click on Continue.
6. Click on OK.

5

Compare percentages across the columns to assess the differences between groups. Overall, the table
indicates Whites follow civic affairs most of the time about 9 % more than blacks, which is nearly a 10
% difference. The situation is reversed for seldom following civic affairs, with about the same
percentage difference. The two groups are nearly identical for some of the time following civic affairs.
You can also compare within each group by examining the percentages within each column. For Whites,
about the same percentage follow civic affairs most of the time or some of the time whereas about 9 %
fewer follow them seldom. For blacks, about the same percentage follow civic affairs seldom and some
of the time whereas about 9 % fewer follow them most of the time. Overall, the column percentages
indicate blacks follow civic affairs less than whites.
The Chi-Square Test of Independence is conducted next to determine whether the differences are
statistically significant, which means their differences are unlikely to have occurred by chance. We will
use the Pearson Chi-Square. Alpha, the probability that the difference occurred by chance, is set at .05,
the standard for most social science research. An alpha of .05 means we are 95 % certain that the
observed difference is not due to chance. If the significance value of our test is .05 or less, the chi-square
is statistically significant. A statistically significant finding indicates the two variables are related, and
an association exists between them. An association means that as one variable changes, the other
changes, and it is one of the necessary conditions for establishing causation.
Please note that a statistically significant finding does not necessarily indicate an important finding.
It just means the difference is unlikely to have occurred by chance. This situation is especially true for
chi-square. Because of the way chi-square is calculated, a statically significant difference is likely for
large sample sizes, even if the difference between the two groups is small.
Follow these steps to calculate chi-square:
1. Go to the Analyze pulldown menu, select Descriptive Statistics and then Crosstabs.
2. Click on Statistics. Check the box next to Chi-Square. Click on Continue.
3. Click on OK.

6

The Pearson Chi-Square has a significance (Asymp. Sig (2-sided)) of .000, which interpreted as
.0005. Because it is less than our alpha of .05, it is statistically significant. The significant chi-square
means the two variables are related with a likelihood greater than chance.
STEP 1A: POST-HOC ANALYSIS
But a significant chi-square tells us little about why the significant difference occurred. One way
to help find out is to examine the contributions of the cells. Chi-square examines the difference between
what you would expect if no relationship exists what is observed in the data. This difference is called a
residual because it is what is left over. The larger the difference between expected and observed
differences, the more important the cell. Fortunately, SPSS can turn this difference into a standardized
score, or z-score, and conduct a significance test. A z-score of ±1.96 has the same probability as a
significance value of .05. Thus, if the residual has a value of ±1.96 or higher, it indicates that cell
contributed significantly – greater than chance – to the result. Moreover, if the z-score is positive, it
indicates more values were in that cell than would be expected if the independent variable did not
matter. Conversely, if the cell is negative, fewer values were in that cell than would be expected if the
independent variable did not matter. Follow these steps:

The cells for Black by Most of the Time (Std. Residual = -2.4) and Black by Seldom (Std.
Residual = 2.5) were statistically significant because their z-scores exceeded ±1.96. The negative
standardized residual (-2.4) indicates fewer black respondents followed civic affairs most of the time
than would be expected if ethnicity did not matter. Conversely, the positive standardized residual (2.5)
indicates more black respondents seldom followed civic affairs than would be expected if ethnicity did
not matter. Thus, key to understanding ethnic differences in following civic affairs is blacks follow them
less most of the time and more seldom.
STEP 2A: ELABORATION MODEL
If the chi-square test is statistically significant, it means the independent variable affects the
dependent variable. In our example, ethnicity affects following civic affairs. But other variables likely
affect the relationship as well, and including them in the analysis helps the journalist better understand
why and how the initial relationship works. The Elaboration Model helps the journalist understand the
effects of these other variables on the initial relationship, and thereby develop a fuller and more
meaningful understanding of it.
First, we will consider the effects of Gender. We know that women often play a dominant role
in African-American families and wonder what effect gender has on the relationship between ethnicity
and following civic affairs.
Under the model, gender is a control variable because we are controlling its effects by including
it in the analysis. We will examine its effects by conducting the analysis for each of its levels. Thus, we
will determine whether the relationship between ethnicity and following civic affairs is similar or
different for men and women.
As before, we will start by examining column percentages. Follow these steps:

First, we will look at Male. White males follow civic affairs most of the time about 7 percent
higher than black males. Conversely, black males seldom follow civic affairs more than white males
with about the same percentage difference. The same percentage of black and white males follow civic
affairs some of the time. Women have the same pattern, but the difference increases to about 9 percent,
which is more likely to me statistically significant. Thus, the gap between blacks and whites for
following civic affairs is wider for females than it is for males.
Now, we will conduct a chi-square analysis and use the Elaboration Model to assess the effects.
Follow these steps.

The probability of .128 for male is greater than .05, so the test is not statistically significant. Thus,
the differences between following civic affairs for black and white males are less than what would be
expected by chance. However, the probability for females is .002, which is less than .05. Thus, a
relationships exists between ethnicity and following civic affairs for females.
Now, we must consult the Elaboration Model chart. Because the results are different for males and
females, the results indicate an interaction between ethnicity and gender. Consequently, the effect of
gender on the relationship between ethnicity and following civic affairs depends on its levels. White
females follow civic affairs more than black females, but no ethnic difference is observed for males.
To help account for the difference among women, we again examine the standardized residuals.

The standardized residuals for black females who follow civic affairs most of the time (-2.1) and black
females who seldom follow civic affairs (2.1) are statistically significant. The negative standardized
10

residual (-2.1) indicates fewer black females followed civic affairs most of the time than would be
expected if ethnicity and gender did not matter. Conversely, the positive standardized residual (2.1)
indicates more black females seldom followed civic affairs than would be expected if ethnicity and
gender did not matter. Thus, the lower following of civic affairs for black females is key to
understanding ethnic and gender differences in following civic affairs
STEP 2A: ELABORATION MODEL; ASSESSING EDUCATION
Next, we will consider the effects of Education. We know that people with higher education
generally follow civic affairs more closely, so we wonder what effect education will have on the
relationship between ethnicity and following civic affairs. Consequently, we replace gender with
education. Follow these steps:

For high school or less, 8.4 % more whites follow civic affairs most of the time than blacks. The other
categories are similar. For some college or more, the only difference was for some of the time, where
whites followed civic affairs more 7.2 % more than blacks. The biggest difference was for graduate
school. In both most of the time and some of the time, the difference was about 20 %, with more whites
11

than blacks following civic affairs. However, the numbers of blacks and whites were much smaller in
this category and thus would take a larger difference to be statistically significant.
Now, we will conduct a chi-square analysis and use the Elaboration Model to assess the effects.
Follow these steps.

Click on OK.

The probability of .001 for high school or less is greater than .05, so the test is statistically
significant. Thus, following civic affairs varies by ethnicity for those with an education of high school or
less. For some college to bachelor’s, the significance was .591, which is not statistically significant. No
difference in following civic affairs existed for the ethnicities for those with some college to bachelor’s.
For graduate education, the significance of .055 is extremely close but exceeds .05. Thus, no statistically
significant difference exists for following civic affairs by ethnicity for those with graduate education.
However, because it is so close the relationship should be examined closely in reporting.
Now, we must consult the Elaboration Model chart. Because the results are different depending on
the level of education, the results again indicate an interaction between ethnicity and education.
Consequently, the effect of education on the relationship between ethnicity and following civic affairs
depends on its levels. Overall, we can say that education makes a difference for following civic affairs
for those with high school or less, where more whites follow civic affairs more closely than blacks.
To help account for the differences in following civic affairs for high school or less, we again
examine the standardized residuals.
12

The standardized residuals for blacks who follow civic affairs most of the time (-2.2) and blacks
who seldom follow civic affairs (2.3) are statistically significant for high school or less. The negative
standardized residual (-2.1) indicates fewer blacks followed civic affairs most of the time with
educations of high school or less than would be expected if ethnicity and education did not matter.
Conversely, the positive standardized residual (2.1) indicates more blacks seldom followed civic affairs
with educations of high school or less than would be expected if ethnicity and gender did not matter.
Thus, the lower following of civic affairs for blacks with high school or less is another key to
understanding ethnic and education differences in following civic affairs.
CONCLUSIONS
Initially, we found a significant relationship between ethnicity and following civic affairs. Our
analysis of standardized residuals indicated fewer blacks followed civic affairs most of theme than
would be expected if ethnicity did not matter whereas more blacks seldom followed civic affairs than
would be expected if ethnicity did not matter. Thus, ethnicity mainly affects following civic affairs
because blacks follow them significantly less than whites.
In addition, we used the Elaboration Model to examine the effects of gender and education on
the relationship between ethnicity and following civic affairs. Let’s summarize what we have found and
offer some possible explanations:
•

Gender interacts with ethnicity to induce different effects in following civic affairs. Following
civic affairs varies significantly by ethnicity for females but not for males. The analysis of
standardized residuals indicates fewer black females follow civic affairs most of the time than
would be expected if gender did not matter whereas more black females seldom follow civic
affairs than if gender did not matter. Thus, it is black females who follow civic affairs less than
13

•

whites that account for the difference. One possible explanation might be that black women often
play a dominant role in black households and thus have less time to follow civic affairs.
Level of education also interacts with ethnicity. Following civic affairs varies significantly by
ethnicity for respondents with high school or less but not for some college to bachelor’s or
graduate school, although it is extremely close to statistical significance. Following a similar
pattern, the analysis of standardized residuals indicates fewer blacks with high school or less
follow civic affairs most of the time than would be expected if level of education did not matter
whereas more blacks with high school or less seldom follow civic affairs than if education did
not matter. Thus, blacks with lower education followed civic affairs less than whites, but the
difference largely disappeared for higher levels of education. This result appears to indicate that
education appears to give blacks more reason to follow civic affairs.

Overall, the analysis indicates the ethnic differences in following civic affairs are mainly
attributable to blacks, who follow them less. Following civic affairs is significantly less for black
females and blacks with a high school education or less. The gender differences could be attributable
to the greater family responsibilities of black women. Because the ethnic differences in following
civic affairs disappear as education increases, education is a key factor in following civic affairs for
blacks. Although this analysis has not included all factors that affect the relationship between
ethnicity and following civic affairs, it has show how the Elaboration Model can help reporters to
better understand what influences it and how.

STEP 2A: ELABORATION MODEL; ASSESSING INCOME
Next, we will consider the effects of Income. We know that people with higher education
generally follow civic affairs more closely, so we wonder what effect education will have on the
relationship between ethnicity and following civic affairs. Consequently, we replace gender with
education. Follow these steps:

For incomes of $9,999 or less, blacks and whites followed public affairs most of the time about the
same. In fact, the differences between blacks and whites were similar for all levels of personal income.
Please note that the personal income levels for the General Social Survey are much lower than in most
databases, such as the HMDA database. The lack of differences by income in this table could be a result
of these lower income categories.
Now, we will conduct a chi-square analysis and use the Elaboration Model to assess the effects.

None of the chi-square tests are statistically significant, which indicates any differences do not
exceed chance probability. Because all tests are significant, it indicates replication of the original results.
Two possible reasons exist for the situation, so we must first determine the time/order of the variables.
STEP 2B: DETERMINE TIME/ORDER
Logically, the control variable, income, comes after ethnicity. Thus, income has no effect on the
relationship between ethnicity and following civic affairs, at least for General Social Survey data. If
income would have had an effect, the relationship would have disappeared because controlling income
would have broken the causal chain (Ethnicity > Income > Civic). The results provide support for a
direct relationship between ethnicity and income. To be more certain about income’s effects, we should
run the analysis again with other data that has a wider range of income categories.
STEP 2A: ELABORATION MODEL; ASSESSING PARTY IDENTIFICATION
Finally, we will consider the effect of Party ID on the relationship between ethnicity and
following civic affairs. Basically, we want to know if identifying with a political party can effect the
relationship between ethnicity and following civic affairs. We know that Republicans tend to be higher
educated and perhaps follow civic affairs closer, but we do not know if that effect works in combination
with ethnicity. Consequently, we replace income with party identification. Follow these steps:
1. Go to the Analyze pulldown menu, select Descriptive Statistics and then Crosstabs.

For Democrats, whites and blacks similarly followed civic affairs most of the time and some of the time.
The main difference was for seldom, where blacks had nearly a 9 % higher percentage. For
Independents, the main difference was for most of the time where whites were about 11 % higher. These
findings indicate that following civic affairs varied by ethnicity depending upon the party. The gap was
even bigger for Republicans, which included few blacks. About 15 percent more whites followed civic
affairs most of the time whereas about 22 % more blacks followed them seldom.
Now, we will conduct a chi-square analysis and use the Elaboration Model to assess the effects.

The significance of Democrat is .024, which is less than .05. Therefore, the results for Democrat are
statistically significant. Following civic affairs for Democrats varies by ethnicity. However, the
significance of .067 for Independent is close to .05 but does not exceed it, so following civic affairs for
Independents does not differ significantly by ethnicity above chance differences. Finally, the
significance of Republican is .005, which is less than .05. Therefore, the results for Republican are
statistically significant. Thus, following civic affairs also varies by ethnicity over the categories for
Republican.
Overall, the chi-squares for Democrat and Republican were significant, but the chi-square for
Independent was not, indicating mixed results and an interaction under the Elaboration Model.

The standardized residuals for Democrat indicates no residuals are statistically significant. The closest
one is seldom with a z-score of 1.7, indicating more black Democrats seldom follow civic affairs than
would be expected if party identification did not matter. The next closet z-score is seldom for white
Democrats at -1.5, indicating fewer white Democrats seldom follow civic affairs than would be expected
if party identification did not matter. For Republicans, the same cell of blacks seldom following civic
affairs has the highest z-score, in this case a statistically significant one at 2.7. Again, it indicates more
black Republicans seldom follow civic affairs than would be expected if party identification did not
matter.
CONCLUSIONS
Initially, we found a significant relationship between ethnicity and following civic affairs. Our
analysis of standardized residuals indicated fewer blacks followed civic affairs most of theme than
would be expected if ethnicity did not matter whereas more blacks seldom followed civic affairs than
would be expected if ethnicity did not matter. Thus, ethnicity mainly affects following civic affairs
because blacks follow them significantly less than whites.
In addition, we used the Elaboration Model to examine the effects of other variables on the
relationship between ethnicity and following civic affairs. Let’s summarize what we have found and
offer some possible explanations:
•

Gender interacts with ethnicity to induce different effects in following civic affairs. Following
civic affairs varies significantly by ethnicity for females but not for males. The analysis of
standardized residuals indicates fewer black females follow civic affairs most of the time than

would be expected if gender did not matter whereas more black females seldom follow civic
affairs than if gender did not matter. Thus, it is black females who follow civic affairs less than
whites that account for the difference. One possible explanation might be that black women often
play a dominant role in black households and thus have less time to follow civic affairs.
Level of education also interacts with ethnicity. Following civic affairs varies significantly by
ethnicity for respondents with high school or less but not for some college to bachelor’s or
graduate school, although it is extremely close to statistical significance. Following a similar
pattern, the analysis of standardized residuals indicates fewer blacks with high school or less
follow civic affairs most of the time than would be expected if level of education did not matter
whereas more blacks with high school or less seldom follow civic affairs than if education did
not matter. Thus, blacks with lower education followed civic affairs less than whites, but the
difference largely disappeared for higher levels of education. This result appears to indicate that
education appears to give blacks more reason to follow civic affairs.
Income did not affect the relationship between ethnicity and following civic affairs. Because
income and education often affect each other, the reason for no effect here might be the limited
personal income levels of the General Social Survey. If family income were examined instead,
perhaps the results might have been different.
Party identification also interacts with ethnicity. Following civic affairs differed by ethnicity for
Democrats and Republicans but not for independents. For both parties, the main difference was
more blacks seldom followed civic affairs more than whites than would be expected if party
identification did not matter. The difference was more pronounced for Republicans, who had
fewer blacks in the party. The results appear to indicate that identifying with a party resulted in
more black participation overall because no difference existed in these groups, but more blacks
still followed them seldom.

Overall, the analysis indicates the ethnic differences in following civic affairs are mainly
attributable to blacks, who follow them less. Following civic affairs is significantly less for black
females and blacks with high school or less education. Although participation is closer overall by
ethnicity for respondents who identify with political parties, more blacks follow civic affairs seldom
than whites. Athough this analysis has not included all factors that affect the relationships between
ethnicity and following civic affairs, it has show how the Elaboration Model can help reporters to
better understand what influences it and how.
