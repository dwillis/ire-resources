Advanced searching options are offered for all Google tabs except Local. They differ slightly for each tab.
To increase your search accuracy try the "advanced operators" Some are listed here.

“”

Use for phrases or exact names
Example: “to be or not to be”
To find which Shakespeare play contains this quote. Searched without quotes, all the
words except "not" are excluded. Those same words searched within quotes retrieve hits
- although not very specific. Scroll down to the bottom and click on Search Within
Type: Shakespeare.

OR

"Or" must be CAPITALIZED.
Example: "sharpe james" OR "cory booker"
Google automatically picks up variant common-name spellings (John retrieves the correct
spelling - Jon Corzine)

+

The absolute "AND"
Example: sharpe james +senator
Normally not necessary because "AND" is the default operator. Only use a plus sign
before a common “stop” word normally ignored

-

Use to exclude a word.
Example: bass -music
Will retrieve fish-related items not music items. Dangerous to use – can unintentionally
knock out good, relevant hits. (For " pure" fishing results add -beer -shoes to eliminate
those false hits.)

~

Search for synonyms.
Example: ~ferry ~accidents
This search retrieves ferry and boat accidents and crashes.

*

Use an asterisk as a WILD CARD to substitute for a word. Example: “George * Bush"
Returns the results: George W and George Walker Bush
