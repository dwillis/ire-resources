Online tools and strategies for:

Backgrounding people
Finding and connecting with sources
Verifying information

Backgrounding people
●
●
●
●
●

Be nosy and curious
Become a student of your subject’s life
Anything you find online is just a lead -- might be true, might not -- that must
be verified with primary-source reporting
Trust your gut
You will sift through a lot of hay to find your needles

Backgrounding: General approach
●

Determine scope and deadline
○
○

●

How much time do you have? Is this a two-day turn or a two-month investigation?
Is your subject a public official? A company that does lots of business with the government? A
random person on the street?

Every person and institution you include in your story needs a basic scrub, but
not everyone needs the $12 wash and wax

Backgrounding: Prioritize your time
1. Run all the basic traps (courts, licensing records, social media, strategic
Googling)
2. Follow up on specific tips
3. Get nosy, be curious, noodle around

Backgrounding: Make it a habit
●
●
●

Background yourself to test website accuracy
Background relatives, dates, babysitters, neighbors
Develop a set of newsroom protocols (checklists are good)

Keep in mind
●
●
●

There is no magic website that will give you all the goods for $19.99, sorry
People aren’t that creative
Extensive backgrounding is key for one-shot interviews

Keep in mind
●
●
●

Good backgrounding can lead to a story
Back up online sleuthing with shoe-leather reporting -- verify and extend what
you find online
Especially for public figures, candidates for office, etc., ask: “Is there anything
in your background I need to know about?”

Watch out for pranksters
If an interviewee gives you a name
and it sounds weird, say it out loud,
slowly

Don’t quote this guy
Greg Packer, the most quoted
man in news

When you’re searching
●
●
●

Use bits of information as keys to unlock new data (e.g., DOB)
Expand your search to family, business partners
Tip: Log dates/facts/sources/notes in a spreadsheet -- instant timeline!

Think through your subject’s life
●
●
●
●
●

911 calls: They get the cops/fire/ambulance called to their homes and
businesses
Property/tax/recording records: They buy and sell property, take out
mortgages, etc.
Obituaries: They have siblings and other relatives listed in family obits
Wedding registries: They get engaged
Wedding license records: They actually get married

Think through your subject’s life
●
●
●

Crowdfunding campaigns: They ask the Internet for money -- GoFundMe,
IndieGoGo, Patreon, Fundly, GiveForward
Social media accounts: They are social on the Internet (more on this in a sec)
Corporate and UCC filings: They own or have a stake in a business, or they
are party to a transaction that typically involves buying goods on credit
○

(“The Uniform Commercial Code is a model statute covering things such as the sale of goods,
credit, bank transactions, conduct of business, warranties, negotiable instruments, loans
secured by personal property and other commercial matters. All states have adopted and
adapted the entire UCC, with the exception of Louisiana, which only adopted parts of it.” -Louisiana SOS)

Think through your subject’s life
●

Court filings: They sue, get sued, are charged with crimes, get divorced, go
bankrupt
○
○

Think through your subject’s life
●

Military records: They served or are serving in a branch of the military
○

●

DMV records: They have a license to drive, they get tickets, they own one or
more cars -- every state has different laws about what information is available
○

members of the military

“NOTE: If requesting an ODR for anyone other than yourself, you will need written
authorization/waiver from the licensee to release their personal information to you.” -- Louisiana
DMV

Patents and trademarks: They invent things or have ideas

Think through your subject’s life
●
●

Campaign finance: They give money to candidate committees, PACs, etc.
