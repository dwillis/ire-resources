Hoover's provides profiles on over 40,000 small, medium, and large
companies, many of which are private or foreign (and therefore difficult to pin
down). Basic information, such as the company's legal name, address of
headquarters, phone and fax numbers, website homepage (which might not
be indexed on search engines), brief description of company's purpose and
products/services, annual sales, number of employees, top executive names
and titles, primary industry, subsidiaries and affiliates, and top competitors
are available for FREE. Now that Hoover's is a subsidiary of Dunn &
Bradstreet, company searches also pull up D&B company records.

Press Releases: Can be a gold mine. Many that can’t be found in some of
the sources listed below can be found via search engines -- try searching for
the company name (shortened to core name if possible to increase hits) and
the terms "officer" or "chief" or "manager" or "head of" or "executive."
Press releases almost always have a quote from a company officer. They also
tend to include the name and phone number for someone who has been
assigned to handle media questions. Try also searching by product or trade
names.
