Corporate PAC contribution limits to leadership PACs
Leadership PACs
can be mechanisms
for special interests
to buy access and
curry favor —
while legally
evading
contribution limits
@mjbeckel

PACs can donate $5,000 per year
to a leadership PAC, meaning
● $10,000 over 2 years to House
members
● $30,000 over 6 six to senators
