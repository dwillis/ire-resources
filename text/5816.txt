Why was I looking at raw FEC data in the ﬁrst place?

Question:
Why was I looking at raw FEC data in the ﬁrst place?
Answer:
That story hasn’t run yet, I don’t work there anymore,
leave me alone.

Other Answer:
I stood on the shoulders of giants.

Why raw FEC data?
●
●
●

Available faster (crucial on ﬁling nights)
More data in it than some of the FEC’s other
data products
When something weird like this turns up,
it’s easier to ﬁgure out what’s going on

Why not raw FEC data?
●

Single-use quirky AF ﬁle type

●

Several versions, inconsistent structure,
headers, codings

@zubakskees’ raw FEC tools
●
●
●

Node CSV parser based on @dwillis’
Fetch (Ruby)
Manually added mappings for paper
forms
Built a loader to iterate the parser
over a set of .fec ﬁles and insert the
results in a Postgres db

Also used by the less savvy reporters in the
newsroom!

Question:
That’s pretty nifty! Can I use it?

Back to the errors...
Some things we tried:
●
●

Looked for outliers, mismatched data types
Compared calculated numbers to reported numbers

Tools we used:
●
●

Python
PostgreSQL

Desk reporting
FEC contracted a
company called
Aurotech which
used software
made by
Captricity which
transcribed
documents using
MechanicalTurk

Develop a theory

Back to Bill
[[RECEIPT]]

Informed searches (things that ﬁt our theory and were
problematic):
●
●
●
●

Names instead of addresses
Blank names
Blank dollar amounts
Nonsense dates

[[RESULTS]]

Figure out what you can say without cleaning!
I didn’t have to ﬁnd all the errors in the paper ﬁlings to say something meaningful
about the error rate!

Figure out what you can say without cleaning!
I didn’t have to ﬁnd all the errors in the paper ﬁlings to say something meaningful
about the error rate!
House candidates had been ﬁling electronically for years
A natural control group for people ﬁlling out their forms wrong!

Counted “signiﬁcant errors”
Looked for filings where the reported summary item was more than +/- 1% off from
my calculation from the itemized receipts (for the first version of every filing.)
This happened in 20 percent of the Senate paper filings, compared to 2 percent of
the House electronic filings.
