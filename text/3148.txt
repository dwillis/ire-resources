Is That Thing Recording?
Basic TV photography and editing for people who never thought they’d be
trying to learn it—until now.***
The Basics If you can, take control of the situation. For most people it’s a BIG DEAL
to be on television or in the newspaper. They will be willing to work with
you to get what you need.
•The more comfortable you are using your camera, the more
natural it will feel for your subject.
•For interviews, rearrange the room to work with available light and
backgrounds (but promise to put everything back!).
• Remind the interviewee THEY ARE NOT LIVE. It’s on tape!

Know Your Camera/Know Yourself •Find the manual controls on your camera—
• Focus—If you don’t know this one, you’re in trouble.
• Iris/exposure—controls how much is light entering the lens
• White Balance—controls the color temperature setting
•Practice a little bit. Learn the quirks of your camera. Get used to
overriding the automatic settings.
•Control Contrast/Control White Balance

What the heck is B-Roll? What’s a Sequence?
Get this part right and editing will be a breeze.
•Say this over and over and over again:
”Wide, medium, tight. Wide, medium, tight……”
•Repetitive action is your friend.
•Don’t be afraid to start/stop someone.
•Subject In/Out of frame.
•Natural Sound-- Shoot with your ears…
•Cutaways—something you need to avoid jump cuts.
•Hold shots for at least 10 seconds.
•Moments!

•Use a tripod, monopod, or some other method to steady your
camera.
•Action/reaction—turn your back on the action.
•If you really get deep into shooting video, ask a videographer what
“the axis” is. Hint: it’s not who the allies fought in World War II.

Sound
•Get a lavalier microphone—people forget they’re wearing it.
•Get a shotgun microphone to use for natural sound. The oncamera microphones aren’t good enough.

Composition
•Rule of thirds
•For interviews—talk space

Lighting
•If you’re lighting a person, make sure you can see their eyes.
•Use lights to control contrast.
•Light the ear you don’t see.
• “Light like God” If it’s good, use the available light.
•Look into buying a few simple light control materials.
--Full Spun Diffusion
--Black Wrap
--Clothes Pins

Soundbites
•Do I have to say it? Get the who, what, why, where, how ON TAPE!!
•If you just missed the bite, be dumb…”Huh? What’d you say?” People
will often repeat a bite and improve upon it.

Editing
•Remember shooting a sequence? Here’s where it pays off!
•Avoid “jump cuts”.
•Pay attention to your pacing. Start at the beginning of your piece often
and play it back. Does it move? Does it seem slow? Fix it!
•Build surprises into your pieces….suspense.
•Look for the moments
***Your camera is your friend. Get to know it and all the magic it can create.
