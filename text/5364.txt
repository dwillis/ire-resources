Blind hiring is any technique that anonymizes or “blinds” personal information that can lead
to unconscious bias about the candidate.
Blind hiring helps increase workplace diversity by allowing us to be more objective when
evaluating a candidate’s skills, knowledge, and potential to succeed, free from biases
about what a “good candidate” looks like (e.g., race, gender, age, education level)
Currently, tools for blind screening and blind pre-hire testing exist, but whether we’ll ever
see widespread adoption of blind interviewing remains to be seen.
The success of your blind hiring program should be captured in metrics by measuring your
diversity statistics for screening, shortlisting, testing, interviewing, hiring, and retention
before and after.
