revised Nov. 21, 2003

Note: For tip sheets/handouts (cheat sheets) ... think "SHORT!" ... like a maximum of 2- 4
pages and include points 1- 5, below
1. Outline course content -- use bullets, a familiar list technique
2. State the overall goal of the course and relate it to journalism...use examples
that have meaning for the people in the current class
3. Organize skills needed to reach the goal in a progressive order from easy to
more difficult (organize courses in progressive order too -- consider a set of 3-4
core courses for ALL learning tracks: spreadsheets, databases, public records
on the Web, math, etc.); each course should include clearly labeled:
• motor skills
• logic skills
4. Give examples of how each skill learned is useful to journalists -- compare/contrast
each skill with a tool (or tools) they are currently using
5. Select 3-5 KEY concepts you want them to learn 100 percent -- cover these
concepts several times during the session -- INVOLVE the learners in their own
learning process by having them:
 take notes at specific times -- (this way you KNOW everyone
has the information to be cooking from the same burner!)
 give verbal quiz questions -- (WAIT for them to answer...if
they're stuck, give them a hint or two based on what has already
been presented in the lesson...in this way, they'll have proof
you've given them the proper tools to work independently of tech
and training support and they'll gain the confidence they'll need to
work through the problem on their own...keep repeating: (a) they
are welcome to take the course as many times as they would
like...also, (b) let them know you'll be available and happy to
answer specific questions -- these last two points are their reserve
parachute as they dive into learning technology -- IF YOU DO NOT
GET QUESTIONS, SOMETHING IS WRONG...INITIATE
FOLLOW-UP CONTACT AND A ONE-ON-ONE "TEACH BACK!" –
see below)
 work through prepared exercises in class...(include various
levels of difficulty so all learners have a challenge)

1

demo their techniques for the class...these demos or "Teach backs"
(my term) allow students from all difficulty levels to participate as
everyone must feel ownership in the process or you'll not have
their full attention...often, you'll learn new techniques from your
resourceful students and when that happens, let them know they
have taught you! Teach backs are also a superb measure of
cognition -- much better than any quiz, test or evaluation form!
 provide them with structured "play time" so they can practice the
techniques they just learned -- (create an easy-level challenge and
allow them to realize there is usually more than one way an answer
can be found or a goal can be reached...make sure everyone
leaves the class feeling empowered to use their new skills on
their own)
6. Make your delivery of each class unique so repeat students will not be bored -- and
neither will you! Make sure the information you present is up-to-date:
IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE...
1. new examples that relate to each student in class
2. detail how other staffers have used the skills in their research
or reporting processes (ask for permission to use names)
3. give examples of how other news organizations are using
these techniques
4. current resources for further "on their own" learning:
suggest specific magazine article(s) or books or Web site(s)
7. Recap how the KEY concepts will allow them to work independent of you with
one or more of the following benefits:
• increased depth in the interviewing and/or writing process
• greater accuracy
• work more efficiently via new time-management skills
• increased creativity
• with improved work comes improved story play and recognition
from management and readers
• opportunities for advancement
8. Plug related courses in your program! (frame various learning tracks so the
students will have a clearer understanding of the training paths they'd like to
follow)
9. Provide sources for further independent learning: suggest 1-2 books they may want
to purchase and tell them why you selected the material(s)
10. Homework with NO deadline! Be sure and do follow-up contact visits with EACH
student on a regular basis -- the NUDGE FACTOR -- until the homework is completed
successfully. You'll know they have been successful not because they TELL you, but
because they SHOW you: Have each student teach the concepts in the homework
back to you! These "teach backs" will prevent them from answering by rote. Teach
backs are also the most accurate way to measure the effectiveness of any technology
training session, course or program.

5 points to ponder:
1. Rule of 3's (borrowed from the advertising side of newspapers)
(1) tell them what you're going to tell them
(2) tell them
(3) tell them again
2. Your survival...ask the best students from all skill levels to be mentors and/or
contributors to a technology newsletter...create a team learning atmosphere for the
new age of team journalism
3. Your survival...do not work in a vacuum...visit with other newsroom trainers and do it
often...make sure you don't reinvent the wheel completely!
4. Your survival...do not take work or technology with you on vacation...unplug the
computer and all other related gadgets!
5. Homework: (yes, even trainers get homework!)
