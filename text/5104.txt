Visualization (vis) defined & motivated
Computer-based visualization systems provide visual representations of datasets
designed to help people carry out tasks more effectively.
Visualization is suitable when there is a need to augment human capabilities
rather than replace people with computational decision-making methods.

• human in the loop needs the details
– doesn't know exactly what questions to ask in advance
– exploration: longterm exploratory data analysis (EDA)
– presentation: known results
– stepping stone towards automation: refining, trustbuilding

• external representation: perception vs cognition
• intended task, measurable definitions of effectiveness

Two vignettes
• a tale of two tools created for journalistic use
– shared frameworks of interdisciplinary methods from my research group
• thinking about collaboration
– roles & rewards, for computer scientists & journalists

• reasoning about visualization design
– beyond pretty pictures

– divergent goals & audiences
• TimeLineCurator: presentation / explanatory
• Overview: investigation / exploratory

3

Collaboration incentives
• why do CS/vis people need to understand journalism’s problems?
– we work with you to understand your driving problems
– we build tools intended to help
• only works out if we understood the problems deeply enough

– we observe how you use them
• if they’re good enough
– CS win: research success stories
– journalist win: access to better tools

– we develop guidelines on how to build better tools in general
• CS win: research progress in visualization

• what pain point could we address with interactive visualization?
– plus some natural language processing (NLP)

Timeline authoring model
• time required for each task

The general case for curation
• build for human in the loop
as continuing need

Architecture

– automatic processing to
accelerate not replace
– assume computational results
good but not perfect
• for the indefinite future!

– visual feedback to accelerate

12

The importance of being brisk
• sexy use case: eureka moment
– enable what was impossible before
– vis tools for new insights & discoveries

• workhorse use case: workflow speedup
– vis tools to accelerate what you’re already doing
• sometimes enables the previously infeasible

• TLC use cases
– started with speedup use case, for presentation
• make this doc into a timeline now!

– two other use cases nudge towards exploration
• comparison between multiple timelines
• speculative browsing

Origin story: WikiLeaks meets Glimmer
• WikiLeaks: hacker-journalist Jonathan Stray analyzing Iraq warlogs
–one instance of general problem: Too Many Documents
–conjectured that existing label classification
falls short of showing all meaningful
structure in data
• friendly action, criminal incident, ...

–he had some NLP, needed better vis tools

• Glimmer: multilevel dimensionality reduction algorithm
–scalability to 30K documents and terms

Evolution across levels
• evolution of task abstraction
– task 1: generate hypotheses → explore → summarize
• obviously you can’t read everything; speed up with tool for categorizing and counting
What?

– task 2: verify hypotheses → locate → identify
• you really do read each doc; speed up with tool to keep track of findings

Why?
How?

• evolution of data abstraction & idioms
– arrange cluster tree to emphasize nodes vs links
– new vis insight: DR scatterplot less effective than cluster tree vis + tagging

What?
Why?
How?

• better affordance for systematic traversal of document cluster hierarchy

Discussion
• how many of you have jumped into data journalism?
– what kind of tools have you used?

• have any of you grappled with timelines?
– what kind of tools did you use?

• have any of you grappled with large document collections?
– what kind of story did you have in mind?
