Counting drug deaths/tracking costs
Pat Beall pbeall@pbpost.com

Heroin into morphine: Once in the body, heroin breaks down into morphine almost immediately. Counting
heroin deaths alone, and not counting morphine, misses huge numbers of heroin deaths classified as
morphine deaths. But using morphine deaths automatically risks including deaths from prescription
morphine, as opposed to heroin-related deaths. For its story on local deaths, The Post included morphine
deaths on a case by case basis, after looking at other factors, such as history of heroin use, presence of
needles, family statements and police reports.

Drug causes of death: Almost no one dies of a single drug anymore. For instance, heroin can interact with
alprazolam to create a lethal combination, when either drug, in and of itself, would not have been lethal. As a
result, death certificates may show the cause of death as multi-drug or poly-drug toxicity, not heroin. Heroin
may be listed as “present” along with the other drugs. We considered deaths where heroin was present to be
heroin-related, but did not identify them as heroin-caused.

Similarly, when counting prescription opioid overdose deaths, oxycodone, the active ingredient in OxyContin,
degrades into oxymorphone, which happens to be the active ingredient in another prescription drug, Opana.
So, deaths from OxyContin could appear to be deaths from using Opana.
Some states now calculate “heroin-related” deaths. What that means can vary from state to state.

Getting beyond the ER: Using hospital discharge data/admissions data which all states collect- though with
different rules/regulations for access- medical codes can be combined to identify the broader health care
burden of the opioid crisis by identifying the broader illnesses generated by opioid drug use. We based our
combinations on a methodology first created by the University of Miami.

Hepatitis C if accompanied by an opioid diagnosis
Select infections common to injection drug users if accompanied by an
opioid diagnosis. (skin abscesses, cardiac infections.)
Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome whether accompanied by an opioid
diagnosis or not. (The babies would not have had an opioid use diagnosis.)
Consider looking for overdoses/poisonings from opioids, plus
heroin/opium. It is very challenging to tease out heroin from all opioids,
and much easier to combine them, which will include prescription opioids,
such as OxyContin (oxycodone) as well as heroin; a much broader picture.
Consider HIV AIDs if linked to an opioid infection

Double counting. This became a risk for us when we wanted to tease out how many people died with heroin
in their system and, separately, how many people died with fentanyl in their system. Because some died with
both, a single death could be counted by the medical examiner twice: once for fentanyl, once for heroin.
Getting patient- or victim-level data let us definitively determine how many people were dying from the drugs
without double counting. However, even with double counting, you can still use the “presence of” heroin in
deaths to gauge its growth. If heroin was present in 10 local deaths in 2005, for instance, and present in 100
in 2016, then that still gives you a solid number- even if those 100 deaths are counted among 100 fentanyl
deaths, because it gives you the lethal trend.
Hospital discharge data hurdles: Every state keeps some form of this data, also known as hospital
admissions data, but the agencies which keep it and the rules and regulations for access vary. To obtain

hospital discharge data from Florida’s Agency for Health Care Administration, we had to sign a legally binding
contract with both civil and criminal penalties. The key points were HIPAA-related. We could not use data if it
might identify a person; i.e., a single OD in 2011 in a small-town hospital would be considered an identifying
problem if we named the hospital and the year. We had to commit to destroy the data at a future date. Only a
handful of individuals at the paper could see the raw data, anyone else could only see published results. And
we paid: Data for Florida 2010-15 totaled approximately $1,100.
Sidestepping HIPAA. HIPAA can pose problems when trying to obtain documents confirming an overdose.
The Post found that while Fire-Rescue reports of an overdose would be delayed or withheld based on HIPAA
considerations, police reports of the same incident were more readily available, and after the case was closed,
in most cases, no information was redacted.
Culling social media. We got opinions from four corporate attorneys on the legality of using photos, quotes
and information from social media, and particularly Facebook, without permission. They said yes, with
caveats: No professional photos, such as wedding or graduation photos, could be used due to copyright. No
photos which included others in the photos-especially children- could be used without permission. The most
important: Identification had to be rock solid. Check your state’s privacy laws, as these differ- and check with
your own lawyers. This is a complex decision, both legally and ethically.

Language. There is an emerging controversy over the use of the word addict, with a move to substitute the
phrase Substance Use Disorder (SUD). We did not use SUD or SUDs. However, unless we had evidence of
addiction, such as a person’s acknowledgement that he/she considered themselves addicted, we used the
phrase heroin user. Some of the people whose lives we wrote about were not addicted; it was their first time,
or one of the first few times, they had used heroin.

Technical Tips: Using Hospital Discharge Data
Mike Stucka mstucka@pbpost.com

Code switch. To process hospital discharge data, we used ICD-9 and ICD-10 medical diagnosis codes. The ICD
10 medical code system replaced the ICD 9 system in late 2015, and in the process the codes themselves
changed dramatically. In ICD-9, a heroin overdose was called poisoning by heroin, 965.01. In ICD-10, it’s
called T40.1X1A, or T40.1, or T40.1X1S, or several other derivatives. This made apples-to-apples comparisons
– ODs in October 2014 with ODs in October 2016, for instance- problematic.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, at cms.gov, maintain lists of ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes.

Methodology. To determine which medical diagnosis codes we wanted to use, and in what combinations, we
borrowed from a peer-reviewed paper from researchers at the University of Miami
(tinyurl.com/miamiopioids) who devised a methodology to calculate the growing costs of IV drug use at
that hospital. It’s an easy-to-read paper, and a good starting point.

Standardize everything. I came into this with two somewhat disparate but related datasets, on emergency
room visits and inpatient admissions. Some of the field names were different, even when measuring the same
thing. Some of the fields that probably should have been captured in both were only present in one. Bunches
of fields were missing; for example, the emergency room data had room for about 10 doctors' diagnoses, but
the inpatient data had room for more than 31. Standardize, standardize, standardize. Standardize everything
you can, rather than what you think you might need.

Sometimes the best indexing is no indexing at all. I built indexes based on the queries I thought I'd be
running against the dataset. When I saw my indexes were 7gb, I got rid of 'em all and never missed 'em. To
steal a thought from the movie War Games, sometimes the only way to win is not to play at all.

Booleans are a good way to turn complex into simple. Want to know if the patient had a heroin overdose?
Make it a boolean, like "ODheroin." Run an update query once to set the flag, and then it's nearly
instantaneous to tally it.

Give yourself extra variables. Many. It took two hours to add a new column. It took two seconds to rename
a column. So, I built a stable of reserve columns in my SQL, like boolean variables b1, b2, b3, ... b9. As
reporting evolved -- say, we looked at HIV or AIDS, and then decided to look at Kaposi's sarcomas -- I could
rename another variable from the pile. Next import I ran, I'd create the Kaposi's variable with everything else,
and restore a full stock of the spare booleans. I cannot begin to say how much time this saved.

Script your scripting. I used Google Sheets to helped build boilerplate scripting. I could look for the heroin
overdose/poisoning code (965.01) in my primary diagnosis field -- but it could also be in about 30 other
fields. So, if I'm manually coding it, I can type in something like:

update bigtable set odheroin=true where prindiag="965.01" or othdiag1="965.01" or othdiag2="965.01" or ...
And repeat for every variable. And sometimes I'm going to have multiple things to look at in each variable,
like 176.0, 176.1, 176.2 and some others. I don't want to retype that boilerplate every time. I don't want to
type that more than once. I don't even want to copy-paste stuff like that.
Enter Google Sheets/Excel formulas:
="update " & A15 & " set " & C15 & "=true where prindiag in (""" & D15 & """) or othdiag1 in (""" & D15 & """)
or othdiag2 in (""" & D15 & """) ...
What did this save? Remnants of my sanity. A single update query ran more than 35,000 characters; yes, a
simple "set this to true where" kind of query was 35kb.

"Sum(case" is a great tool, and greatly simplifies life. I could run queries through my main 16gb table in
about 8 minutes most of the time, especially if I was doing some cleaning up in Excel. And of course you also
get the benefits of boolean logic, allowing you to structure some fairly complex conditions. We did publish our
criteria with our story, and here's the real gist of that story, where the $4.1 million a day came in:
sum(case when prenatal=true or (MiamiInfections=true and MiamiOpioids=true) or (HepC=true and
MiamiOpioids=true) or odopium=true or odheroin=true then tchgs else 0 end) as "Drug-related charges"
