FINDING DANGER IN DATA

Reporter Dylan Purcell
The Philadelphia Inquirer

Don’t worry, it’s easy

Assault on Learning


The major datasets used for the school violence
project and follow up stories:
 Criminal court records
 School district incidents
 School-level enrollments
 District’s student assistance data
 Roster of school police officers with date of birth

Flaws in their safety numbers


We calculated violent crime rates and reached
different conclusions than the upbeat district message
 District relied on raw numbers, we used rates

Interactive tool for the public


Our violent crime rates
gave the public a new
way of finding a safer
school
 Enrollment in this example

dropped from 672 to
447. That was common
and made rates necessary

Assaults were the major problem



We realized assaults were
the major violent crime
problem
 District made improvements in

categories like fires and
weapons but struggled to
control assaults

Digging deeper into assaults

Data showed lack of consistency


Sources said
some incidents
weren’t reported
at all, not even
to the district
 Reporting

decisions were
left to principals
(now changed)

Major change in incidents a clue


We looked for changes in reporting patterns.
Roosevelt improved, but sources told us the school
was actually getting worse

Roosevelt also cheating on test scores?


Sources at
the school
also told of
test cheating
 50 schools

now being
investigated
(1 in 5)

After we wrote about it test scores fell

Elementary schools under-supported


Rates showed
some elementary
schools with
violence
comparable to
high schools


But high schools
received more
district attention

Spikes in violence at some schools
A facial fracture from an
assault was listed as
“disorderly conduct”
 Crime rates were rising


District’s major support program was flooded


We looked at data for their
student support program
 Student records were

unreliable and not comparable
year to year
 Principals stuffed 1 of 3

students into the program,
making support all but a
meaningless exercise

Data showed school police with issues


After the series we crossed criminal court records
with a roster of school officers
 One officer was a twice admitted drug addict for crack
 A source provided employee date of birth info

Birth dates private in PA panel rules


Around the time we showed the
value of government employee
birthdates for public safety, the
courts were ruling against our
paper
 This case was unrelated to the

school police investigation

New use for incident data
After the series I requested a new batch
of district incident data. This time with
incident location.
 Last month a young girl was allegedly
raped in a basement stairwell. At the
high school we found:


 A pattern of sex offense incidents in

basement stairwells
 45 serious incidents in those stairwells in

recent years
