“Empirical Research on Jury Selection”
2006 ISE Conference, Fort Worth, Texas
Justice Track: Investigating Juries

The Representativeness of Juries
* Research shows that a major decline in the representativeness of juries occurs prior to any
courtroom selection
* Evidence shows that attorneys are not great at detecting bias in jurors
* HOWEVER, peremptory challenges do eliminate jurors who will later admit that serving fairly
would have been difficult
* In most routine cases, judges are conservative about declaring that someone cannot be fair

Jurors and Privacy
* Jurors are highly concerned about who has access to their individual information, especially in
criminal cases
* Beliefs about the relevance and sensitivity of jury selection questioning was one of the few
predictors of overall satisfaction with the jury selection process
* Jurors will likely need reassurance about how their personal information was obtained and will
be used
* Spreading “risk”: The more jurors that can be interviewed from a case, the better – both in
terms of data quality and, probably, in terms of privacy protection
