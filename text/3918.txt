Investigating police shootings

Trevon Cole
killed by Las Vegas
police in 2010

Sheriff's response:
“If Trevon Cole and occupants of that
apartment would have done what the officers
had asked them to do, Trevon Cole would be
alive today.”

Police mantras

• "Officers have to make split-second decisions
whether to use using deadly force."

• "Everybody sues police."
• "If we stopped chasing people, everybody
would run away."

• "It's extremely rare for a cop to be involved in
a shooting."

• "It was obviously suicide by cop."

The situation

• No data:
o

Police didn't have any databases (or even reliable
numbers - not unusual)

o

Nobody nationally tracks shootings

o

Create database with the largest sample possible
(20 years, 378 shootings across 11 agencies)

o

Poll comparable agencies (24, but only 16 could
provide decade of shooting numbers)

• To overcome:

Spent a year looking at:

• Every instance of a cop pulling a trigger
outside a training scenario (and dog shoots)

• Police investigative files
• Interviewing anyone linked to a shooting -

detectives, cops, family, administrators, use
of force board members, etc.

• Reading every news story about shootings
and the department (good for history)

• Court records, policies, inquest transcripts

Results

• Understood why they were happening:
o

Police ignored obvious trends

o

Weren't disciplining officers for policy violations

o

An administrative - not officer - problem

o

Problem cops unusually prevalent

o

75 of 519 cops made up 30% of all shootings

• Knew when, where, who was being shot at
• Vegas police ranked high
• Knew who was shooting:

About those mantras...

• "Split-second decisions": Sometimes, but
police needlessly place themselves in
situations that leave them no choice.

• "Everybody sues": Less than 10% do.
• "If we stop chasing...": Ignores reality. 24% of
shootings preceded by foot chases, often
from minor offenses such as jaywalking.
Dangerous for cops.

• "Cop shootings are extremely rare": Fewer
than 1 in 8 of ~2,700 active LVMPD cops have
shot at people. Higher now.

• "Suicide by cop": Only 5% met our strict
definition.

Lessons

• Understand the investigation process
o

Can unlock public records

o

Can identify gaps in oversight

o

Largely dictates how cops can be disciplined

o

Can show if police are holding officers to policies

o

PERF, PARC, DOJ, IACP, etc.

o

Fatal shootings , even injuries, don't tell whole story.

• Get your department's policy manual

• Who's doing it right?
• Broaden your scope
