BEFORE THE DISASTER
CREATE A SPOT-NEWS CHECKLIST
MAKE IT SPECIFIC FOR YOUR TEAM, YOUR STATE, YOUR CITY
[] background all players (prior stories, public records, lawsuits/court)
[] request mug shots
[] request jailhouse interviews
[] check Facebook/twitter/email/story chat for tips & photos
[] find family
[] internet search/google search key players
[] court paperwork
[] call sources (even supporting agencies)
Be prepared—keep up sources in a variety of agencies, organizations (cell phones/text)
Subscribe to email/text alerts from competitors (know what they are doing)
ONCE THE DISASTER HAPPENS
Create a flow chart off checklist/assign calls
Divide and conquer—use other reporters/photographers/producers/partners/other
departments
Start writing a web/TV story immediately—and add to it
Put yourself in the shoes of who you are trying to track down (Zazi)
Find out HOW an agency is supposed to work—did anything go wrong (balloon
boy/spam king)
Use the tools you have (cell phone camera, video)
Court paperwork can be a goldmine (capitol shooter)
Read story chat’s, twitter, Facebook comments, email (Colorado Springs airplane guy)
Follow up with sources every day—could be easy follow
Write follow up letters or go back to ask for interviews (just because they aren’t talking
today doesn’t mean they won’t) (Spam King)
Remember: we are helping cover more breaking news because of staffing
problems—but it is giving us the opportunity to find investigative stories that make
a real impact.
