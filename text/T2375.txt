Internet Tools for Research
This is a list of sources compiled by the Editorial Library at the L.A. Times for newsroom and library
users. Some are tutorial in nature, some are good for long-range research, and some will get you quick
answers for breaking news.

Times staffer. A primary Internet skill is evaluating a website and verifying authenticity before using
material or information from that site. The tools in the Search Engines section of this handout should
help you develop that skill.
