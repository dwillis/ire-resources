Journalists are a resilient tribe, but we are also
vulnerable to psychological injury, no less so
than firefighters, police officers, paramedics,
or soldiers — and we need training,
psychological support and leadership aware
of these issues.
--Bruce Shapiro, Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma

We have all put ourselves in harm’s
way at one time or another, but no
one wants to be the special
snowflake who is precious about
their safety.

What does the research say about journalists and PTSD?
Stress, three ways
Single incident stressor:
●
●
●

●

18 journalists who witnessed and reported on an execution
one month later many reported short-term difficulties with dissociation, anxiety, and depression
None reported severe or long-lasting psychological problems
Yet journalists experienced distress* following the execution even though (1) the journalists
themselves were not at risk, (2) the event was socially sanctioned, and (3) the witnesses had
time to psychologically prepare themselves.

What does the research say about journalists and PTSD?
Stress, three ways
Variety traumatic events:
○

● Group of journalists who had reported on traumatic events over three
years (e.g., war, bank robberies, riots, rapes, and homicides) vs. control
● Relationship between specifically work-related traumatic events and
PTSD symptoms was greater with non-work-related traumatic events,
suggesting that traumatic events increase PTSD symptoms

What does the research say about journalists and PTSD?
Stress, three ways
Impact of covering war:
The lifetime prevalence rate of PTSD in war journalists was 28.6%, nearly
the same as first responders.

Trauma Exposure in Similar Fields (Human Rights/Aid)

● Human rights/humanitarian professionals have similar
rates of trauma exposure.

34.4% directly witnessed violence
19.4% diagnosed with PTSD

Duty of Care: A Matter of Legal and Ethical Obligation
○

What does the law say?

○

Duty of Care
Negligence
Personal Injury

Ethics?
■
■

■

In the United States, journalism codes of ethics govern the relationship between the
individual journalist and the public.
The journalist’s ethical duty is to ‘inform the public” and “minimize harm” (SPJ Code of
Ethics).
There is no equivalent code of ethics to govern the treatment of journalists themselves
(Palmer, Center for Journalism Ethics, 2016)

Duty of Care, Continued
○

Palmer argues that news organizations have a duty of care for reporters’ psychological
well-being as this can impact the journalists’ ability to remain ethical.
■
Physical safety: “Freelance Journalist Safety Principles”. Only covers “dangerous
assignments”

○

Scholars Spratt and Beam (2009) surveyed 400 U.S. journalists and found that “management
support may be critical in helping journalists cope effectively with trauma,” and only 20 percent
of journalists said they felt prepared to deal with victims of violent or traumatic events.
significant relationship between newsroom/management support and effects of exposure to
violent or tragic events for journalists.

Could this happen in the U.S.?
○

Reuters hired mental health/wellbeing advocate

What the judge said the paper should have done:
● Ongoing training of journalists (especially young) and editors on
recognizing trauma/vicarious trauma and how to handle
● Create a peer support program (volunteer) to debrief reporters
exposed to trauma
● Create a culture to talk openly about trauma issues and expect
questions on wellbeing if exposed.
● Create a written policy on how to handle journalists showing
symptoms and handle beat change requests reasonably quickly.
● Current help may be inadequate: EAP ineffective if
appointments take weeks; ‘take a walk’ can be dismissive

What to do about it?
Understanding the stress response
●
●
●
●

Sympathetic vs parasympathetic nervous system
In stress, body mobilizes all resources to help us rise to the challenge
Stuck on on/off
Multiple types of stress responses

Managing our response can lead to
●
●
●
●
●

Clear and creative thought: Broaden and Bend theory
Focusing: Managing the “noise”
Responsive vs reactive thoughts and actions; equanimity
Managing the “negativity bias”
Deeper relationships

Growth mindset

Growth vs Fixed Mindset
Neuroplasticity (soft-wired, flexible brain)

Social support is a protective factor that can mitigate the effects of stress
Formal and informal

Mindfulness techniques

Next steps for the profession
1.
2.
3.

Ongoing professional and public dialogue about journalistic stress and mental
health
Stress management training and classes as part of journalism programs and
job training
Shared spaces and networks for journalists to form communities of social
support

Unimaginable
After Newtown, NAMI
and Newtown Police
Chief Michael Kehoe
wrote a manual to help
police chiefs prepare
their officers to respond
and to cope with the
aftermath of disaster.

Our officers make many
sacrifices during their careers,
and their emotional well-being
should be among our top
priorities.

Police, Newtown, Connecticut

A ‘Playbook’ for Law Enforcement
○ Before: How chiefs can prepare their agencies,
considerations while planning for disaster response
○ During: Best practices, checklists, resources for
agencies scrambling to respond to a mass casualty
event
○ After: Explains trauma and PTSD, how it affects first
responders, how to help, long-term mental-health
needs

Your Newsroom Needs a
Playbook
For mass shootings, tornadoes, hurricanes,
harassment, disasters and journalist support

Prepare
Self-care includes planning
and preparation.

Talk through the big issues.
Have a plan for coverage
during and after a disaster.

Do no harm.

Mass shootings are
relatively rare. But
journalists cover disasters
regularly.
With a playbook, all hands
on deck will know their
roles and responsibilities.
Far less guessing, no
reason to panic.

Newsroom Playbook Part 1: Prepare
CREATE A DISASTER COVERAGE CHECKLIST
●
●
●
●
●
●

How do reporters and editors communicate? This is key.
Who goes where? What do readers/viewers need to know
immediately?
Who monitors social media and verifies content?
Ask people who claim to be witnesses: How do you know this? Who
told you? Be polite, but persistent.
Review best practices and your newsroom’s ethical standards.
What questions may arise? RTDNA Crisis Planning worksheet is a
great way to start the conversation.

Newsroom Playbook Part 1 (cont’d)
DISASTER COVERAGE CHECKLIST
●
●
●

Review journalist safety protocols, especially in active shooter and
protests / large crowds.
What is the procedure if a journalist is detained or arrested?
Maintain a tipsheet for mass casualty and coverage events
○ Reporting resources. Know which agencies hold which records.
○ Ethical guidelines
○ Follow-up coverage - File records requests to local, state and
federal agencies immediately.

& Newsroom Support
You can’t do your job if you’re a hot mess.

Support &
Self-Care
You will be emotionally
affected by a mass
shooting, tornado,
terrorist attack

All journalists cover
tragedies.
The magnitude of disaster
coverage is different.
How do you help your
colleagues? How do you
help yourself?
What can your managers do
to help?

Newsrooms are not
known as places to
talk about feelings.
But a little
understanding can
make a big difference.

CARE AND SUPPORT
LET GO OF WORRIES ABOUT ‘STOLEN VALOR,’ OR ‘MAKING IT ALL
ABOUT ME’
●

●

It is true that the disaster isn’t your tragedy. You do get to go home to your family,
when so many other families will never be whole again. You didn’t see the carnage
up close.
You can still experience vicarious trauma.

○
○
○
○
○

Trouble sleeping.
Inability to focus.
Crying more than usual.
Compassion fatigue.
Feeling hopeless.

● You cannot process an enormously tragic event in a
day or a week. It takes time. Sometimes a long time.
● Talk with colleagues about your experiences. Long or
short, formal or as you pack up after you file, these
conversations help us process what we saw, heard and
experienced while covering a mass shooting or disaster.
● Acknowledge your feelings. They will make themselves
known one way or another.
*I paid a journalism trauma counselor $300 for these tips so you don’t have to.

● Set boundaries for yourself. It is OK to tell your editor or
news director, “I just can’t cover this one today.”
● Check in on colleagues, especially the ones who aren’t
saying much.
● Expect good days and bad days. You may feel fine
reporting a follow-up but find yourself emotional during
edits.
● Take time off. Step back. The tragedy will not go away
anytime soon. Pace yourself.

It is ok to cry in your
newsroom.
Even if you’re the boss.
Especially if you’re the boss.
Make sure your staff understands that.

Dave Cullen, Author of ‘Columbine’ & ‘Parkland’
At least 4 or 5 times over the last 20 years I’ve said I’m
never writing about another school shooting.
When I signed off on the first book, the crying fits
stopped immediately. But, of course, the shootings
escalated.
I have PTSD rules with my shrink — to not watch
survivor stories. I can feel when it’s spiraling out of
control. I’ve never really talked about it, but I’ve been
suicidal.
-- Dave Cullen, in a February Q&A with New York
Magazine

Cullen’s Tips for Journalists Covering Traumatic Events
It doesn’t really matter how you think you should feel.
Grief is involuntary. Everyone experiences grief in life.
Everyone hurts for different reasons.
● You can ignore your feelings and do shi**y work. Or you
can acknowledge them.
● Know your limits. Understand your triggers. Set
boundaries. Avoid reading or watching certain coverage.
Bow out of certain assignments. Take time off. Do things
you love.

The Forgotten
Piece of
Healing from
Trauma

FIND
YOUR
JOY

Balance the
darkness with
joy

● I could take steps
to diminish the
pain, but that only
cut the pain back.
● Work on the joy
side.
