Story Topics to Turn Education Into a Watchdog
Beat
Safety and security: In the post-Columbine and post-Virginia Tech world, test your
school’s safety programs. Can you easily walk into the building? Does anyone stop you?
Are you required to show an ID? Readers would love to know
What emergency systems do your local schools use to notify the community of an
emergency? After the V-T tragedy, more than one local school said they would use
church bells. Does your school district have an automatic telephone system? You may be
surprised at the “emergency notices” that parents and teachers receive
School violence: who is responsible and what happens to the perpetrators? How many
are special education students? Focus on assaults on teachers and staff?
Testing Zero Tolerance--What’s your district’s zero tolerance policy on weapons,
knives, scissors etc mean in real cases? Find out the details. Is there such a thing as going
too far?

Violence Data--What does the district count as violent? Are drugs reported? Your first
challenge is getting accurate data. No Child Left Behind requires reporting but many
states fail to verify. In Philadelphia, The Inquirer revealed that the city schools were
routinely underreporting their incidents to the state.
Analyze by age, school, calculate a rate per school over time.
What happens outside school? Do students stay out of school because they are afraid of
being pushed and punched? Do they end up in truancy court?
Test Scores: Leave to love them. Five years after the implementation of NCLB and there
is an array of data that will allow you to determine whether all of the testing is leading to
any improvement. Ways to look at the results:

•Same school over time
•Same class of students over several grades i.e. a cohort study
•Racial comparison to test progress in narrowing achievement gap
•Over three years, look at most improved, least improved
Regression
• Use as tip off
• Linear regression has muscle but the word need not appear in your stories
• It tests how strong a relationship is between two or more variables I.E. poverty and
performance

• R-Square: Look for 1
• Look at your districts in statewide analysis
• Enlist expert to duplicate your analysis or to do the regression
Fiscal stories:

•Superintendent’s contract—what’s the buy out deal? How do contracts compare from
one district to the other?

•Overtime: who gets it and why; how about $100,000 in OT for the superintendent’s
secretary?

•School foundations—Who contributes to these non-profits and how are they spending
the money; Do any of the companies do business with the district?

• Field Trip Costs—do parents pay? What if the district pays too? What if students can’t
afford it?

• Expenses—What does the board and administrators spend—cell phone, credit card
expenses; travel; dinner meetings. Check board meeting attendance

• Legal Fees—Organize the billings by dates and by number of hours and give it the
reasonableness test. No lawyer can bill for nearly around the clock work. Which firm
gets the school district’s bond work?

• Double dippers—does your district allow highly paid administrators to retire and be
rehired as consultants?

• Does the state or district require criminal background checks of school staff? What
does it turn up? What about bus drivers and other support personnel?

• Where do the sexual predators live? How close to the schools? Your state probably has
a Megan’s Law list you can get.
Documents/Data to Get:
• Superintendent’s Contract
• Vendors List (data) w/amounts

• Overtime /salary records
• Legal fees—how much and who gets
• Consultant contracts
Payroll/Staff

• Look to state for statewide list of all professional “certificated” staff w/ salary details;
what do teachers and principals earn extra? Ask for all amounts paid, not just salary.

• Use payroll to analyze by gender, race, salary, assignments
• Use payroll to find favorite days for teachers and staff to call in sick
Collect Your Own

• For most recent data
• To answer specific questions
• To cover a wide geography with many school districts
• Report Card: Compare results by similar schools; http://go.philly.com./reportcard
