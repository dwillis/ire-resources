Think like a researcher
◎ Internet creates a lot of noise — have a
search strategy
◎ Look for experts, studies, datasets
◎ Evaluate the source — is it current,
reputable?

Keep your journalist’s skepticism

Backgrounding & research tips
Stay organized

Use a checklist

Verify, verify, verify

As you search, log all the records
you find in a spreadsheet, noting
date, address, description, notes,
connections, source, link, etc. Print
electronic files to a pdf and keep in
a folder.

And background all sources - even
for features and sports.

Verify all information. Go to
primary source documents to cq
information found on the web or in
news accounts.

Search yourself

Expand your search

Run your own name, friends
through websites to get an idea of
reliability.

Background relatives, business
associates. Talk to old neighbors,
teachers, etc.

Think outside the
box
Obituaries, marriage and divorce
records and other civil filings can
be great places to find relatives and
property or personal details. Voter
registries typically include birth
dates and addresses.

Log everything!
