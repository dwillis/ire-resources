Two years ago Kaas & Mulvad did this overall intro to pdf­tools:

Out of this our main advice was to use Cometdocs, due to its ability to handle all kind of
special characters in different languages. As an IRE­member, you get this for free. Look
here on how:

And just start with the program here without a free account:
https://www.cometdocs.com/
Very lately another tool was announced, Ilovepdf. It has been around for awhile, but just
included extraction of pdf to Excel. In some cases it works better.
http://www.ilovepdf.com/
A third tool has also just been announced, Investintech. According to my experience it result
in the same quality as Cometdocs. Look here:

.
I think we will see a new wave with more smart pdf­tools to come. Be aware. Try different
tools, and choose what is working best in the different pdf’s.
