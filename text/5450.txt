Data reporting on the
criminal justice beat!

The obstacles!
• It’s fragmented.
• It’s unreliable.
• Even basic information is not tracked.
• Criminal justice records often contain
sensitive information that makes it
easier for agencies to argue it’s
unreleasable.
• But the situation is improving.

Where to start!

Crime trends:
• FBI’s Uniform Crime Report
• The National Incident Based Reporting System
• The National Crime Victimization Survey
Cops, courts, corrections nationally:

• Local, state and federal agencies
• The Bureau of Justice Statistics (but the data is old)
Check out the Hall of Justice
• a searchable inventory of criminal justice
datasets and research by category and
location.

OR MAYBE EVEN…… Create your own!

Report out the records!
• What’s kept, and how do they keep it?
• Ask the agency, advocates, lawyers, staﬀ members, anyone who
interacts with the system.

• Look at the exhibits in lawsuits.
• Ask for the underlying data from reports.
• Look for clues in audits, inspector general reports.
• Request code book, records layout, data dictionary, user manuals.
• Get really specific.
• Sample request for an entire file/database.
• Information is power.
• Consider: Where will this be easiest/most plausible?

What happened to prison staffers who are prosecuted
for sexual abuse? What is the criminal sanction?!
1 investigating agency!
+!
1 prosecuting agency!
=!
A promising document trail!

Answer: mostly probation!

Upgrade your jail cell, for a price!

Enter document mode!
• Assume it exists, until proven otherwise.
• Brainstorm a list of every agency involved
• Paper trails: both people and institutions leave
them.

• If I were (blank), what paperwork would I need
to fill out? What forms does this incident
generate?

• Think about where they send data.
• Have a back up plan.

What we did
• Built a unique database of 3,500 pay-to-stay
participants between 2011 and 2015

• 26 jails, each kept their records diﬀerently
• Gathered name, dates incarcerated, court of
jurisdiction, conviction, and total amount paid for each
individual

• Standardized information across all cities so it was
uniform and ready for analysis

• Applications + receipts + electronic conviction look up =
all the information we need

Actually getting the
records !

• Be a person.
• Use the phone.
• Go beyond being polite. Be nice, if you can.
• Assume the best intentions (or act like you do).
• Be firm.
• Document everything.
• Follow up like clockwork.
• Expect obstruction.
• Involve more people.
• Don’t allow yourself to be ignored.
• Know the law.
• Don’t give up.

A tale of one city: Anaheim!

request for data
about jail’s
clients
• 12/8/15: request
denied
• 12/8/15: filed
new request for
“granted
applications”
• 1/4/16: Sure, but
there will be
redactions
• Please show me
a sample

involved
May 2016: lawsuit is drafted
6/8/16: unredacted
applications received
Summer 2016: build database
Fall 2016: Will they just fill in
the length of stay?
“No.”
10/11/16: request every
receipt
11/7/16: Sure, for $210, with
redactions
Okay, send a sample
Response:
11/16/16: RECEIVE UNREDACTED RECORDS!!

Always:!

• look for ways to gain leverage
• ask for records in a digital format
• think ahead about standardization
• ask for a sample document to view redactions/challenge
redactions where plausible
• ask for itemized breakdown of fees/challenge fees where
plausible
• ask that documents be provided on a rolling basis
• appeal it all the way up
• if you can, contact lawyers
• report report report until you’ve confirmed every way possible
you’re not overlooking something
• send your final analysis to every relevant agency, along with
methodology, with plenty of time before publishing

Ideas for database/records requests !
Jail databases:
• % pretrial
• bail amounts
• how long awaiting trial
• overcrowding

Prison sexual abuse records:
• compare # of allegations/
substantiated/
unsubstantiated
• accused staﬀ
• follow the document trail to
see if prosecutors pursue it

Strip search records
• Some departments
Prisoner grievances:
require separate form
• these can be used as a
• allows you to see
starting point to learn
justification
the types of conditions
• how often something was
people are living in
found and not
Use of force reports
• ask for summaries, and do it for both
police and corrections oﬃcers
