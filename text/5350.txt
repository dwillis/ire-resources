Covering opioids with data
By Charles Ornstein, ProPublica
(With assistance from many)
Updated March 2018

Reporting accurately on the opioid epidemic requires having current, reliable data to track how it’s
evolving and the toll it’s taking. This tipsheet will help provide data sources on 1) How opioids are being
prescribed across the country, 2) Deaths and hospitalizations linked to opioids, and 3) Treatment for
opioid abuse and addiction, including doctors who are certified to prescribe buprenorphine. Moreover,
there are a variety of state and local resources, listed at the bottom of this tipsheet. If you find others,
please send them to ​charles.ornstein@propublica.org​.

Aggregator sites
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services​ has a website, ​https://www.hhs.gov/opioids/​,
which lays out the government’s opioid strategy and data. The data can be found at
https://www.hhs.gov/opioids/about-the-epidemic/index.html#data​.
Another good site is run by ​amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research​, ​http://opioid.amfar.org/​. What I
love about this site is that you can see the source of each data point and download the raw data.
BNL Consulting​ has built an opioid dashboard using some of the public data listed above. Here’s a link to
a post about it: ​http://bnlconsulting.com/blog/opioid-epidemic-data-insights/​ and to the dashboard
itself: ​http://opioid.bnlconsulting.com/​. (Note: The data is more dated than some of the other national
sources.)
Finally, check out the ​Opioid mapping initiative: “​The purpose of the initiative and this site is to provide
a list of applications and open data sets that local health and law enforcement agencies have identified
as important to their communities. It also provides critical and timely resources, including: technical
guidance and best practices, success stories; how-to articles; and links to related efforts.”

iques/​.
But mostly, you have to go from site to site to find the data you’re looking for:

Prescribing patterns
Opioid prescribing within Medicare (state, county, ZIP Code, doctor): ​The tool shows geographic
comparisons, at the state, county, and ZIP code levels, of opioid prescription claims in Medicare Part D,
which covers more than 40 million seniors and disabled people. It allows you to see both the number
and percentage of opioid claims at the local level. Drawback: The data is from 2013-2015. For an

evolving epidemic, this data sadly lags far behind.
https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Pr
ovider-Charge-Data/OpioidMap.html​ (Click Download Opioid Map Data). For data on individual doctors,
this is the best link: ​https://data.cms.gov/browse?tags=opioidmap​.
This map shows the changes over that time:
https://cms-oeda.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=3a83265af7ba4a78b8a40ee6e58
00fa5​.
ProPublica’s Prescriber Checkup​ tool allows you to look up top prescribers of individual drugs and
compare doctors within a medical specialty and state based on their prescribing patterns.
https://projects.propublica.org/checkup/​ It’s free to use, but the entire data can be purchased from
our data store: ​https://www.propublica.org/datastore/dataset/prescriber-checkup​.

Prescribing within Medicaid (state level):
https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/prescription-drugs/state-drug-utilization-data/index.html​ (This
includes not just opioids but all drugs dispensed in the Medicaid program). It is only at the state level,
not the county level or the prescriber level.
CDC opioid data (state and county level): ​The CDC also publishes data on opioid prescribing by state and
by county: ​https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/maps/rxrate-maps.html​.
VA data (by VA hospital): ​In early 2018, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs released data showing
opioid-dispensing rates for each VA hospital and how much those rates have changed over time. The
data will be updated twice a year.
https://www.data.va.gov/story/department-veterans-affairs-opioid-prescribing-data
FDA opioid data (national)​: The FDA published a data brief in March showing that opioid prescriptions
are decreasing.
https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/Reports/UCM598899.pdf

DEA opioid data (3-digit ZIP Code):​ The DEA publicly releases certain data from ARCOS, the Automated
Reports and Consolidated Ordering System. ARCOS is a data collection system in which manufacturers
and distributors report their controlled substances transactions. The public report includes retail drug
distribution by zip code within states (by grams/weight, not by pill count).
https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/arcos/retail_drug_summary/

Overdoses and hospitalizations
CDC overdose and hospitalization data: ​The CDC publishes a rolling summary of overdose deaths:
https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm​. It also had monthly estimates (but
they were last updated in August 2017):
https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/health_policy/monthly-drug-overdose-death-estimates.pdf​.
This report from 2017 is particularly thorough:
https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/pdf/pubs/2017-cdc-drug-surveillance-report.pdf
In March, the CDC published data showing that emergency room visits for opioid overdoses rose 30%
across the U.S. from July 2016 through September 2017. This includes data for 16 states.
https://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/opioid-overdoses/​ and
https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/mm6709e1.htm​.
Opioid hospitalizations: ​Based on the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, run by AHRQ.
https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/faststats/OpioidUseServlet

CDC Wonder: ​Use the CDC’s Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research:
https://wonder.cdc.gov/​. This is the multiple cause of death data, 1999-2016:
https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd-icd10.html​.
National Center for Health Statistics: ​Issued a report in December 2017 using “the most recent data
from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) to update trends in drug overdose deaths, describe
demographic and geographic patterns, and identify shifts in the types of drugs involved.”
https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db294.htm​. The New York Times did a nice interactive
on the increase in opioid deaths among blacks:
https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/22/upshot/opioid-deaths-are-spreading-rapidly-into-bla
ck-america.html?_r=0​. Vox also looked at the issue:
https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/12/22/16808490/opioid-epidemic-black-white​.

Other data
The ​DEA’s National Forensic Laboratory Information System​ (NFLIS) “systematically collects results
from drug chemistry analyses conducted by state, local and federal forensic laboratories across the
country.” It issues periodic reports but there is a time lag.
https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/nflis/index.html
Drug company payments to doctors: ​Under the Sunshine Act (part of the 2010 Affordable Care Act),
drug and medical device companies must publicly disclose their payments to doctors. You can search by
company making payments or by doctor: ​https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov/​ or
https://projects.propublica.org/docdollars/​.

National Survey on Drug Use and Health: ​The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH)
provides national and state-level data on the use of tobacco, alcohol, illicit drugs (including non-medical
use of prescription drugs) and mental health in the United States. It is sponsored by the Substance
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), an agency within HHS.

The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System ​“monitors six types of health-risk behaviors that
contribute to the leading causes of death and disability among youth and adults,” including alcohol and
other drug use. YRBSS includes a national school-based survey conducted by CDC and state, territorial,
tribal, and local surveys. ​https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/index.htm
National Institute on Drug Abuse​ “Monitoring the Future” survey: “The survey has measured drug,
alcohol, and cigarette use and related attitudes among adolescent students nationwide” since 1975.
Survey participants report their drug use behaviors across three time periods: lifetime, past year, and
past month. ​https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/monitoring-future
Adoption and foster care:​ The Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS),
compiled by the Administration for Children & Families, “collects case-level information on all children in
foster care and those who have been adopted with title IV-E agency involvement.” It includes a field on
the reason children are entering foster care--and one of the reasons is drug abuse.

Medicaid Spending on Medications to Treat Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose: ​The Urban Institute
gathered data on Medicaid spending for addiction treatment. It found, “Between 2011 and 2016,
spending on Medicaid-covered prescriptions used to treat opioid addiction and overdoses increased
from $394 million to $930 million, an average annual increase of 19 percent. Spending grew faster in
later years, with a 30 percent increase between 2015 and 2016. Certain states—including Kentucky,
Maine, and Ohio—have seen particularly fast growth. These same states, and others, could be
particularly hard hit by reductions in Medicaid spending growth under consideration in Congress
because of their fast growth and high rates of fatal overdoses.”
