Questions

Get organized
Google Sheets is
your friend

File layouts, record retention schedules
What do your agencies keep?
Ask for file layout, also known as as “data dictionary”
Record retention schedules can yield similar information
Talk to internal librarians, archival experts (legislative bodies often have these)

Salary databases
Important to request at least once per year
You will identify your agency’s
highest/lowest paid employees
Can come in handy if news breaks/a tip leaks
and you need to talk with current/former
employees
You can also periodically request databases
of former employees but this is the most
essential thing to request

Expenditures databases
Ask for a database detailing what
expenditures your agency has made
in the past six or 12 months to see if
you can root out any government
waste or suspicious purchases

Letters of intent to sue

Court settlements
Find out what your city has been
screwing up the most and what it
has had to pay out for
Could lead to easy daily in case you
find an interesting or big settlement
Is there a pattern? This could be an
enterprise/investigative story

Are government programs, resources actually working?
Don’t take government’s word for it
Cold calls will get you far, especially
through pandemic
The question to ask isn’t whether an
agency is doing something but whether
it’s working
Get peers to help you make calls — in
this case they asked 80 pharmacies

Accountability: Election 2020 edition
1. Election integrity
2. Facilitating an election during a pandemic
●
●

Who will keep voters and poll workers
safe? Who will keep ballots safe?
How will governments pay for extra
expenses? (drop boxes, PPE, extra
training)

Covering (long) BOE meetings; getting to know
election directors

Accountability: pandemic edition 1
Pandemic response
●

●

File regular PIA requests for testing data — broken down by Zip code, race, age
(officials are most likely tracking more data than they’re releasing)
What did officials promise in April (Re: testing, PPE, care)? Have those promises
been fulfilled?
How are officials deciding their pandemic decisions? Who are they listening to? How
are they making reopening calculations?
How does your jurisdiction compare to neighboring / similar jurisdictions in terms of
caseload / death rates? Why?

Problem of “dirty data”

Pandemic accountability: examples

Nursing homes — inspection reports, citations, fines

Accountability: pandemic edition 2
●

Budgets: What exactly is being cut from the budget because of
revenue losses? Why did officials make those decisions — are those
programs really expendable? Who do these programs affect?
Equity: Tracking disparities in health / policing / education — were
promises made to bridge those inequities? By when?

Final thoughts
Look ahead: Set calendar reminders for goals set by officials with ambitious plans
Slow down every so often, make sure you’re following you own goals. Set aside at least an hour
each day to pursue projects or enterprise (not breaking)
Set one goal for yourself each day and do it
2:2:2 rule (but be flexible and let yourself rest)
