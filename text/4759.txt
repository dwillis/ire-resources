Correlation is causation
Questions to ask
Random error
• what is the margin of error?
• is the study very small or very large?
• statistics be damned, is the conclusion at all plausible?
• might there have been a fishing expedition?
• are the numbers cherry picked?
Confounding
• are there alternative explanations?
• can you think of a common cause of treatment and outcome?
• when comparing two groups of people according to one criterion, are those groups equal on
all other counts?
• what about age, wealth, time?
• was the study observational or was it an experiment with random assignment?
Selection bias
• is the data a representative sample of the population?
• what are the selection criteria for admission to the population?
• are people with poor outcomes or good outcomes consistently measured, or do they become
invisible?
Measurement error
• how was everything measured?
• was the data self-reported?
• when adjusting for a confounder, does the way the confounder is measured capture the full
extent of the phenomenon?
• what is the proposed causal pathway; are there alternatives?
• was the research limited to the best or worst cases?
Judgment error
• what claims are being made?
• what was actually tested?
• does the conclusion logically follow, or is it just one explanation among many?
• if we expect long term effects, would the data be able to show those?

Discussion
• According to the PISA math tests, the Finnish are great at mathematics but Americans not
so much. What kind of confounders might there be?
• The Hawthorne effect is a particular kind of placebo effect where any kind of organizational
change you make will lead to positive outcomes… at least until the novelty wears off and
people return to their usual routines. Can you think of an example of the Hawthorne effect
in an organization you’ve worked for?
• Psychology is a very rigorous discipline as far as social science goes, because it relies almost
exclusively on randomized experiments rather than observational research. However, to save
money, usually the guinea pigs are psychology students. Can you think of scenarios where
that might affect the conclusions?
• Studies show that when a child plays video games, it is more likely to show aggressive behavior
when playing and play-acting with other kids immediately afterwards. Why should we be
worried? Why not?
• Last year a study was published that showed that all the time you spend on your kids might
not actually translate into better outcomes such as your kids getting into a good college. To
figure out how involved parents were, the study asked how they spent their time on Saturday
and Monday. How do you feel about this study? What is good about it and what could be
better?
• The jury’s still out on whether boys are better at math than girls. One theory is that boys are
more variable: they’re better and worse at the same time. Would it be fair to conclude that
men make the best mathematicians? Alternatively, assume that boys and girls are equally
good at math – why might girls do worse on math tests?
• The broken window theory is the idea that deviance leads to more deviance, and so to clean
up bad neighborhoods, we shouldn’t just fight crime, we should also take care of litter, make
sure people in the neighborhoods keep their homes in good repair and so on. New York City
has long based its policing approach on the broken window theory. After its introduction,
crime rates dropped. Does the approach work? How could we distinguish whether the
approach actually works, or whether the declining crime rates dropped independently of the
new approach?
• Meta-analysis of research into the effects of minimum wage on the economy shows a curious
effect: invariably, the smaller the study, the larger the purported (positive or negative) effect.
