Discussion focus:
During our panel I will discuss the evolving legal landscape of access to information
under state and federal open records statutes. I will focus my remarks by exploring how
the so-called “privacy” rights of various individuals and entities have, in the recent past,
been deemed to outweigh the public’s “right to know” what our government is up to:
1. information about private individuals (e.g., their voices recorded on 911 tapes,
being closed in Alabama, Ohio, Wisconsin and Florida. See
http://www.rcfp.org/newsitems/index.php?i=11316 );
2. “survivors’ rights” -- family members of decedents (Vince Foster, Columbia
Space Shuttle astronauts, Dale Earnhardt Jr., and Dawn Brancheau)
See, e.g., http://www.stinkyjournalism.org/editordetail.php?id=683 &
http://www.newsweek.com/blogs/techtonic-shifts/2010/03/10/when-a-familytragedy-turns-into-a-youtube-sensation.html ;
3. “Privacy” rights of corporations. See
http://www.rcfp.org/newsitems/docs/20100527_114220_brief.pdf
4. "privacy" rights of government employees (with respect to e-mails, text
messages, and cell phone records). See
