The FOIA Maze:
Tips for getting the records you need

David Donald, Data Editor

“What we have here is a failure
to communicate.”
• FOIA works best when both sides talk with
respect, so
• Acknowledge that both sides have their
pressures.
• More is better.
• Be prepared.I
• If you cover a building, know the FOIA
officer in it.

Know the law

Why?
• Let the FOIA officer or others you’re
talking with know that you’ve done your
homework. It’s not their job to do the
homework for you.
• Don’t cite FOIA where it doesn’t apply:
Congress, federal courts, etc.
• Talk knowledgeably about exemptions.
This helps with asking for the right
records.

Know the records
• Read as much about the records/data as
you can find.
– Other researchers already may have acquired
and used the records/data.
– You might find that what you want already is
distributed on the department or agency’s
Website.
– Data dictionaries may be online.

Know the records (cont.)
• Puts you in a better position if you have to
negotiate during the process.
• You can use your knowledge to negotiate what
can be redacted by giving up what you don’t
need for the story and insist on what you do
need.

Ask smart questions
• What could I do to facilitate my request
being filled promptly?
• When should I check back with you?
• How would you prefer that I file?

When to file
• File early.
• I repeat – file early.
• Did I say file early?
• I mean file early.
• It may mean filing for records/data before
your story pitch. It means starting with a
document/data frame of mind. It means
talking records/data at the very start.

A good request
• Cite the law.
• Be specific without being too limiting –
leave room to negotiate.
• Request a fee waiver and expedited
release but don’t expect one.

For data
• Request the data dictionary, record layout,
coding sheets and any other metadata.
• Know what the law allows regarding
electronic formats.
– “We request that data are provided in
electronic format such as a spreadsheet or a
text delimited data file as the online database
indicates that the data are easily reproducible
in one of those formats.”

Negotiate
• How can you change the request and still
get what you need if denied?
• Remind the FOIA officer that a denial
requires an exemption – and that
exemption is in the law.
• Know what are reasonable fees if the fee
waiver is denied, as you may have to pay
reasonable fees.

Track your filing
• Create a spreadsheet that includes
– When the request was made.
– What was requested.
– Who you sent the request to.
– When should they respond by.
– How you requested the records (e.g. data
format).
– All follow up information.

Final thoughts
• It’s serious business, so what’s important
is success. Be firm, be persistent, but take
the high road.
• Keep a sense of humor. You win more
often when you keep your smile.
• And you want to win.
