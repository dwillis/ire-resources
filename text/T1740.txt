LOCAL GOVERNMENT

Request expenses.
1. Mayor’s office
2. City council members
3. Department heads (including police and fire chiefs)
Meet the friends
Who are the key supporters of the mayor, city council members and other elected
officials?
1. Cell phone records: who do they call the most and talk to the longest? Who are the
biggest cell phone users?
2. Contributions – Not just during campaigns, but year-round.
Do your elected officials have discretionary funds? Check with the election office.
They have to report money they receive while in office. Do they spend it on polling?
Entertaining or travel?
Do they receive contributions other than cash? Maybe a car, vacation get-away, or
polling and strategic planning services?
Know the neighbors
1. Go to neighborhood meetings, develop contacts
2. Get to know employees, in the mayor’s office, or city council office.
They won’t squeal on their boss, but they might tip you off to what is happening in
another department.
Go to meetings
You don’t have to write a story everytime you go to a meeting.
Collect ideas. See who is there, who gets along and who doesn’t.
Request information.
The possibilities are endless:
Employee overtime
Claims
Lawsuits
Correspondence (even e-mail)
Expenses
Construction contracts
Requests for bids/proposals
Request the FOIA’s made by your competition
