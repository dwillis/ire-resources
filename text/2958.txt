names of those who served and those who died. You often can find these pages
simply by typing the name of the unit into Google. Here’s an example:

Tips for finding military personnel and their survivors from Janet
Lundblad, sr. researcher at the L.A. Times:
How to locate anyone who is or has been in the military; Armed Forces
locator guide, Richard S. Johnson, Debra Johnson Knox, 8th ed. Spartanburg,
SC : MIE Publishing. 1999. A good brainstorming resource. Some useful
appendices:
List of Social Security number area prefixes and corresponding geographic
area.
Directories of Military Installations / Coast Guard and Navy Ships. – useful
to match zip codes listed in online people finder records.
Military rankings for branches of service.
Directory of Military & Patriotic Organizations.

A FEW TIPS:
Use every element of the record to help locate person you are seeking. The
first 3 digits of a Social Security number can lead to geographic location. Some
people finder records will list squadron number in the address. ie vma-231. A
middle initial from a JAG report, may start the search for a common surnamed pilot.
Look for patterns & similarities when tracking people who are of a group. Get
to know the locations of bases and training sites, and surrounding towns.
Remain persistent: Locating someone is a multi-step process: Use all resources
available, and be creative in thinking beyond the obvious people finder resources.
Small town public libraries may provide obituaries and next-of-kin. Archives and
history centers may store files of news clippings, official records, or memos. Seek
new leads from interviews.
Organization: Use a spreadsheet to sort out all known data and build a composite
profile. Use it to track progress.

VIETNAM -- THE WAR CRIMES FILES
By Nick Turse and Deborah Nelson
Aug. 6 and 20, 2006
www.latimes.com/vietnam
We analyzed the Vietnam War Crimes Working Group files, collected
by the Army chief of staff’s office in the 1970s, declassified circa 1994
and stored at the National Archives and Records Administration in
College Park, Md. http://www.archives.gov/
The boxes contain Army Criminal Investigation Division case
summaries; investigation files with sworn statements from suspects,
witnesses and survivors; memoranda; reports; correspondence; press
clippings. Far from a complete accounting of Vietnam war crimes
reports, the files represent the largest collection to surface to date.
Our analysis found:
+320 substantiated allegations of atrocities such as murder, rape,
assault, prisoner abuse, mutilation and pillaging.
+203 suspects identified in substantiated attacks on noncombatants:
57 were tried by courts-martial.
23 of those tried by courts-martial were convicted.
14 of those convicted were sentenced to prison.
Also: The files contained more than 500 allegations that Army
investigators could not or did not try to substantiate.
