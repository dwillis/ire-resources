A FEW TIPS:
Use every element of the record to help locate person you are seeking. The first 3 digits
of a Social Security number can lead to geographic location. Some people finder records
will list squadron number in the address. ie vma-231. A middle initial from a JAG report,
may start the search for a common surnamed pilot.
Look for patterns and similarities when tracking down people who are of a group. Get
to know the locations of bases and training sites, and surrounding towns.. Harrier pilots

are currently based in Yuma, AZ, and Cherry Point, North Carolina, and a number of
them attended flight school in Pensacola Florida, and sometimes officer training school in
Quantico, VA.
Remain persistent:
Think about locating someone as a multistep process: Use all resources
available, and be creative in thinking beyond the obvious people finder resources. Small
town public libraries may provide obituaries and next-of-kin. Archives and history
centers may store files of news clippings, official records, or memos.
Seek new leads from interviews: While searching for names of Harrier pilots
and survivors, reporters inquired about names of pilots involved in Harrier accidents,
widow’s names, or their geographic location.
Organization: Use a spreadsheet to sort out all known data and build a composite profile.
Use it to track progress.
