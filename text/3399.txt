Pinning Down the Reluctant Interview for Controversial Stories

Be Aware of Current, Common PR Tactics

They try to get as much info from you, and hold out the interview as the “reward” but then often don’t
provide the interview. They pose a litany of questions as a prerequisite for the possible interview:
o

•

“What’s the theme or angle of your story?”
“What questions will you ask?”
“Who else are you interviewing?” or “Who else have you talked to?”
“When will it air?” “How long will the story be?” “What program will it appear on?”

They want to avoid the interview but don’t want you to say they “refused.”

They say they will get back to you, but never do.
They may later claim they never got the interview request.
They say the right person is “unavailable” (on a plane, on vacation, in a meeting, out of the
country).
They say they’d like to do the interview, but just can’t accommodate the deadline.
Email is Your Best Friend

•

With any verbal request, follow up in writing via email as proof of the request and to make it more difficult
for them to ignore it or fail to answer. In the email, ask them to “hit reply” immediately to confirm receipt.
If they don’t reply by the time named in your email,

•

In the email, be firm but accommodating, polite and specific. Include a deadline for response (earlier than
the proposed interview time), and include the proposed interview time. Convey flexibility in the interview
time and place (to the extent it’s possible). Assume the email may be passed on to other parties and even
seen publicly.

•

Don’t give specific questions (unless this differs from your news organization’s policy), but do give a fair
idea of subject matter. Sometimes that’s all they really want.

•

If they may be worried you are going to “surprise” them with info in the interview, but you aren’t planning
to, you can allude to that in email to reassure them and perhaps convince them to agree.

•

Explain that viewers will want to hear their side of the story and that this is the best way for them to tell it.

•

For public figures, if they continue to refuse, explain that viewers (or taxpayers) have a right to hear their
explanations regarding the controversy at hand. Don’t threaten, but convey that if they don’t do the
interview, that fact will be reflected in the report.

•

For elected officials, if they continue to refuse, explain that they have a responsibility to address issues that
concern their constituents, especially on matters of public interest, public safety, spending, etc. Convey that
if they don’t do the interview, that fact will be reflected in the report.

Pinning Down the Reluctant Interview for Controversial Stories
Email Example:
Dear Press Aide to Senator X:
This is to follow up on the phone conversation we just had (or the phone message I just left for you). I am requesting an interview
with Senator X for today at 2pm. As discussed, I would need him to explain why he earmarked $1 million tax dollars to his
brother-in-law’s paint business. I need an answer as soon as possible, but no later than 11am today. Please hit reply now to let me
know you received this.
Thank you, Sharyl Attkisson
Sharyl,
We can’t agree to an interview without knowing more information. What’s the theme of your story? What are your questions?
Who else is appearing on camera? How long will the story be? In any event, the Senator is in a meeting at 2pm.
Senator X’s Press Aide
Dear Press Aide:
We don’t provide specific questions in advance, and typically don’t convey who else is appearing on camera and how long it will
be (those details can always change up until the last minute), but I understand you want to be sure the Senator can address the
questions we ask. So to give you an idea of what we would be discussing, the Senator would need to speak to the allegations the
opposing party has made about him saying that there was a conflict of interest in the earmark since it went to the Senator’s
relative. The Senator would need to be able to give his best reasons as to why he thinks the earmark was not a conflict of interest
and was, instead, a wise use of tax money. I wouldn’t say the story has a “theme,” we are currently researching the facts and that
is why we are reaching out to the Senator, so we can hear his side of the story. Since he is unavailable at 2pm, can you suggest an
alternate time? I will work hard to accommodate the Senator’s busy schedule and could do the interview in as little as 15 minutes
at a time and place of his convenience.
Sharyl Attkisson
Sharyl,
The Senator would really love to do an interview, but will be getting on a plane immediately after his meeting and will therefore
be unable to meet your deadline.
Press Aide
Press Aide:
Perhaps we could catch the Senator on his way to the airport. A second choice would be somebody else in his office speaking on
his behalf to represent his views. In this story, taxpayers and voters will want to hear their Senator’s response to the controversial
allegations that have surfaced. I’m afraid it will be difficult for them to understand why, when Senator X has promised full
transparency, he is not making himself available to speak to the issue at hand. To be clear: I am not planning to surprise the
Senator by asking about his personal tax controversy during this interview; I am only interested currently in the controversy
about the earmark as described.
Sharyl Attkisson
Sharyl,
If you can be at his office at 2:30 sharp, he will conduct a brief interview.
