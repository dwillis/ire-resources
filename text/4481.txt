Turning Your Reporting Into an eBook
Pros






It’s more than 140 characters! An eBook offers a chance to write narrative long form or a
deep dive into a subject at a time when it can be hard to carve out space in print.
An eBook doesn’t have to be an intimidating “book” project. Ours was the length of a
long magazine feature. (5,000-7,000 words.) You can read it at: wsj.com/deadlymedicine
It’s a place for reporting to breathe a bit. Details, anecdotes and deeper insight that don’t
make it into stories can find new life in an eBook.
You don’t need an agent or a traditional publisher.
It cements your ownership of a story. In a competitive situation, it elevates your voice
above others. In an enterprise project, it establishes your work as authoritative and
complete.
It’s fun! For many newspaper and website reporters and editors, tackling a long-form
piece is a new and satisfying challenge.
An eBook serves as a calling card for sources and future projects.
You don’t always have to do new work: Reader-friendly pieces, such as popular columns
or stories about a local sports championship, can be collected into an ebook and offered
as a bonus to subscribers.

Cons




It will take longer than you think, probably a few months even if you’ve done much of
the reporting. Be prepared to put in some nights and weekends.
An eBook is a journalistic labor of love. It isn’t likely to make much money, drive many
new readers to your website or bring you considerable fame.
Most journalism prize contests don’t consider eBooks as part of submissions.

Getting Started With an Original eBook




Important questions: Do you have the material to carry a long-form piece? Is there a
narrative that will push the story forward and give the reader something to grasp? Do you
have important reveals throughout? Is there significantly more to say beyond what has
been published already? How much more work would it take to fill in the missing pieces?
Do you have art and/or graphics and the rights to use them? That’s a lot of words if
there’s no art.
Call in favors and/or win the support of top editors who can enlist others. You may need
a designer, the support of your website and/or IT department, graphics and photo



departments, and an editor and copy editor. For the very lucky, marketing help would be
a big boost.
Treat the book like a long reporting project even if you have a lot of the material already.
Consider doing an outline. Set up organizational meetings. Make sure all the stakeholders
know what they are facing going into the project.

The Nitty Gritty of Publishing








There are three types of eBook files: PDF, Mobi (for Kindle) and ePub (for Apple
devices).
Many readers, especially older ones, might be fine downloading a PDF from your
website. Consider this as a (theoretically) quicker and cheaper option.
o Pros: Many programs, including Microsoft Word and Google Docs, can easily
create PDFs. But if the intended design is more complex (photos, graphics, text
flow, etc.) the more time you’ll need and the more people and software—such as
Adobe Acrobat—you’ll need to involve.
o Cons: You can’t distribute it on a larger platform, such as Amazon. Your site
managers will need to do extra work to build a page to host the file and detangle
issues such as making sure the book is readable on all platforms (desktop, tablet,
mobile).
An eBook publisher/distributor such as Smashwords will convert your Word document
into multiple file types and get the book on Apple iBooks, Barnes & Noble, Kobo, Scribd
and smaller outlets. Aerbook will also convert the file and offers a tier of pricing plans.
Another publisher, Vook, plans to relaunch soon as pronoun.com.
o Pros: It can be free or not too expensive. You don’t have to struggle with file
conversions. They can also help with the design. (Warning: Check with your
lawyers before outsourcing content production.) You can get sales reports.
o Cons: If you charge money, many distributors take a commission. You can’t
control customer service if things get messy.
Amazon is its own animal. You have to create your own account with them and you may
have to charge at least a nominal fee.
If you or your site managers want to collect substantial web usage data about people who
download the book (or want to request an email address or other verification), many
third-party distributors offer relatively little tracking. In those cases, you might want to
distribute on your own.

Tips




Don’t forget to have your company lawyers read the book.
Test, test, test. Don’t launch the book without downloading it onto different platforms.
Don’t forget marketing. How will readers know to find your book? Develop a social
media strategy. Ask for a house ad in the paper. Promote to specialized websites.
