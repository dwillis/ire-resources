”Evolving Forms and the Future of Live Coverage”— NICAR, 2018 #15

Annotated Live Transcriptions
Pros:
Readers:

Tech:

Cons:

●

Every annotation
completely in context

●

Long events make for long
transcripts

●

Transcription becomes a
resource after the event

●

Keeping track of new
information is not
intuitive

●

Breaks down into
components well

●

Getting structure out of
Google Doc is hard

●

The data already exists

●

Transcripts are inevitably
messy.

Smart Notifications: Pros
●

A re-think of what a notification
should do

●

Instead of driving users towards
coverage, it is coverage

●

Often results in more engagement
— a persistent notification can be
tapped many times

Smart Notifications: Cons
● Irritated by repeated
device alerts
● Data-heavy notifications
have cold or distant tone
● Notifications are currently
low-fi (but improving
quickly)

Augmented Podcasting
● Expand on player
limitations
● Send notifications tied to
current place in an episode
● Keeps audience
on-platform when seeking
out resources

‘Smarticles’ & Chat Bots
● Expand on format
limitations
● Trigger notifications based
on place in story
● Keeps audience on-platform
when seeking out resources
