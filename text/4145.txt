In a time B.C. (Before CAR)

Daycare Data
Printed Pages, Color Coding,
Highlighters, Cutting and
Pasting, Post-Its…

In a time B.C. (Before CAR)

You should know…
I still have files, a rolodex,
and print-outs
It’s good to have copies

And making them for a visual medium…

Look for data EVERYWHERE
- Think of agencies and what they have
- Cruise government websites
-Look within topics you already cover
- Ask for ANY data you can think of
- Stockpile data (like accidents)
- Think of data available fast (like elections)
- Think visual early… start talking with
photographers and artists now

Still didn’t really know how to use Excel or Access…
Prescription Drug Costs
-Call pharmacies for prices
-Build your own database
-Order by amount
-Make some graphics

A data project using Excel and Access

- STEP 1: Download data from
federal Bureau of Transportation
Statistics – as much as you want

A data project using Excel and Access

1,500 results for flights in Boise in 2013!

- STEP 2: Start sorting and look
for any trends that could be
stories – like increases, decreases

- STEP 3: Try it in Excel and in
Access

- STEP 4: Make “data sentences” and
graphics for television and web

A data project using Excel and Access

- STEP 5: Put it in context, ask
the experts and stakeholders
what your research means for
them

Another data project using Excel

- STEP 1: Ask transportation
agency how crash data is kept
and categorized. States report
this to the federal agencies, so it
should be available in some
format.

Another data project using Excel

-STEP 2: Ask for data over the
past few years - I asked for
crashes coded as ‘serious’ or
‘fatal’ on Interstate 84 for around
200 mileposts.
-In my case, they were able to
send in Excel format
-Categories included mileposts,
how many victims, weather
conditions, how the crash
happened and if alcohol was
involved

Another data project using Excel

-STEP 3: Start sorting
-Look for trends like
particular mileposts
with crashes or alcohol
impairment
-Once you narrow
down areas, look at
weather and other
conditions
-Chart it out and look
for easy visuals

Another data project using Excel

-STEP 4: Take the data to
the experts for context and
explanation. I took my data
to the Idaho State Police
Crash Reconstruction Unit.

Another data project using Excel

-STEP 5: Think of ways
to visualize the data. I
worked with a
photographer who
drove the interstate
with a Go Pro camera
and we added graphics
afterward.

A quick and visual project using Excel

In this story, I found
population changes
over the last decade
was of concern to
businesses and the
Department of Labor.

A quick and visual project using Excel

The Idaho
Transportation Dept.
provided this dataset
for free in Excel format
in just a couple of
days.
This yearly data shows
driver’s licenses
surrendered and what
states they were from.

A quick and visual project using Excel

Add the numbers
from each state
for both in and
out migration.
The simple way
to say this was:
‘Where are they
going?’
A graphic artist
made maps
using my charts

A quick and visual project using Excel
Another easy extra from Department of Labor
data that helped illustrate the real shift in jobs
because of a shift in the workforce.
They called this ‘The Silver Tsunami’

Using county jail data to determine the cost of recidivism

This project involves a lot of data but it can
be distilled to show how much money
taxpayers spend when people reoffend,
especially on minor or misdemeanor crimes

Using county jail data to determine the cost of recidivism

Initially, the jail would only give me printouts, but after going back and forth a few
times, the sheriff’s office gave me two
databases that contained everything I
wanted… I ended up merging them to get
what I wanted to work with.

FUN FORMULA!
Removing
duplicate data:
=IF(MAX(COUNTIF(
A2:A17570,A2:A175
70))>1,"Duplicate","
No Duplicate")

Visualizing the data
– Spell out the
math in graphics

Visualizing the data
– Chart what makes
sense. The charges
were easy to see in
a pie chart.

For when you need a day of story

Post-Election Data
-Votes by Precinct: Where did the issue pass
or fail? Where did the winner’s votes come
from?

For when you need a day of story

Post-Election Data
-Voter turn-out: How much did the county
spend per vote?
-Campaign spending: How much did that
candidate “spend” per vote?

For when you need a day of story

Stockpile or grab ready-to-go data
-National data, like bridge inspections and
FBI crime statistics
-Good if there is breaking news or national
story, like Washington bridge collapse

For when you need a day of story

Put things into perspective
-When there’s a cost story, like government
spending, do quick cost calculations in easy
spreadsheets

When you need to put numbers on television

BE CREATIVE
-Work with graphic artists or bounce ideas
off co-workers
-Graph it, list it, map it
-Use your big monitors, weather walls,
OTSs, split screens… whatever you have
-Use animations, especially for lists, if
available
