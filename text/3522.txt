Covering Defense Department Weapons Programs
IRE National Conference 2011 Orlando
Tony Capaccio Bloomberg News acapaccio@bloomberg.net
The Pentagon since September 2001 has spent more than $700
billion on weapons procurement and research and development. The
money ``has resulted in relatively modest gains in actual
military capability,'' Defense Secretary Robert Gates said in a
May 24 speech. He called it a ``vexing and disturbing'' reality.
Gates' observations raise a lot of questions for D.C.
policy makers and also for reporters covering the defense
industry and weapons programs in their areas: how well are the
contractors performing and how well do the weapons work?
The Pentagon this fiscal year is spending $185 billion for
weapons procurement and research. It's requesting $188 billion
for fiscal 2012.
So weapons spending remains a ripe area of investigative or
even ``how-it-works'' inquiry.
Here are some tips to get you started:
Weapons budgets are protected by the ``Iron Triangle'' of
military services, lawmakers and contractors who often hire
consultants and lobbyists to protect the money. It's useful to
cultivate sources in these areas. The military legislative
assistants, or MLA, in each congressional office of your state
are good to know.
Overview
First, to get up to speed on current weapons programs you
need to know the major contractors in your state. Start with the
listing at USAspending.gov and run a state profile.
Click On ``Summaries'' FY 2010 to see macro view of defense
spending. You can also sort by agency and ``congressional''
districts to track spending.
The Pentagon Comptroller site for the fiscal 2012 budget
lists an excellent ``Overview'' document that explains
relatively clearly for DoD the budget, proposed savings, DoD
defense organizations and casualty websites. Very useful
document for getting an instant education on military spending.

The next key annual Comptroller document is the ``Program
Acquisition Costs by Weapon System'' book that provides one-page
descriptions of vehicles, ships, tanks, rockets, missiles,
aircraft and satellites, who makes them and the budget request.

The Pentagon also posts online an Atlas/Data Abstract that
gives detailed state breakdowns of military personnel, bases,
contractors. It's really useful as a starting point even through
the current edition is dated FY 2009. It's located athttp://siadapp.dmdc.osd.mil/personnel/Pubs.htm
The U.S. Government Accountability Office's annual weapons
reports is also a crucial resource:
http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d10388sp.pdf.
It outlines the status of each major weapons program,
including problems and progress. It also gives a snapshot of the
current overall cost of the Pentagon's weapons portfolio
Then check if there is a regional GAO field office. GAO
auditors are good sources of context on defense management and
weapons programs and can give insights into ongoing work and
reports near completion.
They are also free to talk about reports already released:

Hearings On-line
Congressional hearings accessed on-line through the U.S.
Government Printing Office are valuable for gathering
information on status and problems. The annual ground combat,
shipbuilding and aviation-specific hearings of the House and
Senate armed services and appropriations subcommittees often
disclose nuggets.
The most valuable hearings have extensive additional
``questions and answers'' for the record that aren't available
until publication but contain previously undisclosed
information. Here's a link to a March 10, 2010 House Armed
Services Committee listing on Army Acquisition Programs:

Defense market analyst Byron Callan of Capital Alpha
Partners LLC has put together a very useful ``Defense Primer''
that covers markets, companies and the defense budgeting
process, He is willing to share the document, prepared for
clients, on request. Email him at Byron.callan@capalphadc.com.

Test Reports, Oversight
The Pentagon's Director of Operational Test and Evaluation

publishes an annual report on weapons testing status that for
years has been almost impossible to obtain. The Pentagon after
the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks pulled the report from its website,
citing security issues. It's been released in hard copy over the
years and occasionally defense think tanks have obtained and
posted the copies.
The threat has passed and the document is now online.
http://www.dote.osd.mil/pub/annrep.html. The reports now are
posted from 1999. They are invaluable for tracing the history of
missile defense testing and information on systems currently in
use overseas such as the General Dynamics Corp. wheeled Stryker
Army vehicle.
The last two reports also warned of the proliferation of
unreliable equipment that's entering production.
If your area is heavy with defense contractors see if the
Defense Contract Management Agency, or DCMA, has a field office
or representative in a major defense facility at DCMA.mil. DCMA
now has a FOIA reading room where it has posted monthly reports
it's released on the F-35 fighter program at
http://www.dcma.mil/dcmahq/FOIA/reading_room.cfm
The agency also issues Corrective Action Requests to
defense contractors on a Level 1-4 basis, with 4 being the
worst. The agency will often confirm in response to a written
question through its Public Affairs office whether a company has
any pending CARS and the nature of the violation.

Jacqueline.noble@dcma.mil
The Washington D.C.-based Project On Government Oversight
is developing a database of all the serious Level-3 and Level-4
CARS issued in the last couple years.
Costs
You can track the cost of major weapons by checking the
quarterly Selected Acquisition Reports, or SARS, published four
times a year: http://www.acq.osd.mil/ara/am/sar. The quarterly
compilation includes how much Congress has approved to date and
total cost in inflation-adjusted dollars.
For example, the joint Army-Marine Corps Mrap fortified
vehicle program for Iraq and Afghanistan is estimated to cost
$36.2 billion, with $26.3 billion already approved by Congress.
The detailed reports on which the summaries are based are
harder to get but distributed to Congress on the Pentagon's
Defense Acquisition Management Information Retrieval System. The
Federal of American Scientists ``Secrecy News'' has posted the
most recent SAR for the $382 billion F-35 fighter project, the
Pentagon's most expensive program.

http://www.fas.org/man/eprint/F-35-SAR.pdf
It also has posted the SAR for the Navy's 55-ship Littoral
Combat Ship at http://www.fas.org/man/eprint/LCS-SAR.pdf
A new compilation of essays by long-time military reformers
contains a useful primer on weapons costs, ``The Pentagon
Labyrinth.''

Unsung Documents
Service magazines and affiliated organizations put out
annual editions that give good descriptions of weapons programs.
These include the Almanac editions of Seapower, Air Force
Association and Association of the U.S. Army.
Here's a list of military journals in your area of
coverage. Check out:
http://www.au.af.mil/au/aul/periodicals/dodelecj.htm
Sometimes the most obscure Pentagon budget documents yield
a tip. Case in point are ``Reprogramming'' documents that spell
out when the Pentagon wants to shift funds. I spotted the
mention in a reprogramming request to shift funds to buy more
Boeing `Scan Eagle' drones for counterterrorism operations.
Reprogramings are listed on the Pentagon Comptroller
website at:
http://comptroller.defense.gov/execution/reprogramming/
I was able to track details of Navy SEAL use of the Boeing
drone by reading the Navy Special Warfare magazine Ethos:
http://www.navsoc.navy.mil/pdf/Ethos/ETHOS_ISSUE_7.pdf
I was then able to arrange an interview with a SEAL drone
operator quoted in the story and get official comment from the
U.S. Central Command.
It resulted in the July 19, 2009 story entitled ``Boeing
Drones Play Pivotal Role in War on Taliban, Al-Qaeda.''
The Comptroller site also lists so-called Budget
Justification books issued by each service the budget.
They are listed under the ``Links to Budget Materials''
section of the Comptroller page:
http://comptroller.defense.gov/Budget2012.html
I have used the book for the Missile Defense Agency
``Procurement'' to track production delays with Lockheed
Martin's new Thaad anti-missile interceptor for the U.S. Army by
comparing the delivery schedules listed over a two or three year
period. http://tinyurl.com/3kazxj8
It resulted in a story on ``Lockheed Delay On Interceptor

Slows Mideast Defense.''
The books are also useful for piercing the veil of secrecy
over U.S. Special Operations research, missions and equipment -http://tinyurl.com/4xp2h3r
I was able to assembly a piece on one of the Special
Operations Commands most sensitive missions -- tracking weapons
of mass destruction -- through the use of March 16 Senate
hearing available at http://tinyurl.com/3hceea8
I also plowed through the ``Counter-Terrorism
Technologies'' project description in the Defense Threat
Reduction Agency, or DTRA, justification book. It supports the
secret commando mission.
DTRA's research budget book is at:
