Welcome to the jungle...
▪ Public records is a complicated web of statutes,
caselaw, regulations, written and unwritten policies,
and luck

FOIA: what is it good for?

Are public records right for me?
▪ Consider not filing a formal request: just ask!
▪ However…
▪ There are circumstances when it’s important to get records in an
official way
▪ Many government officials refuse to work outside of the public
records law framework

Starting Out
▪ Know the law!
▪ Federal Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. §
552
▪ And federal agency regulations!

▪ New York Freedom of Information Law (FOIL), N.Y.
Pub. Off. Law §§ 84 et seq.
▪ And agency regs

▪ New Jersey Open Public Records Act (OPRA),
N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1 et seq.
▪ And common law!

▪ Pennsylvania Right to Know Law/Sunshine Act,
65 Pa.C.S. §§ 701 et seq.

▪ Cite the applicable law in your request!

Know the Law—States
▪ RCFP publishes free guides to
all 50 states and DC -▪ www.rcfp.org/open-governmentguide

▪ Recently published new edition
with latest information, caselaw,
advisory opinions, and
practices, including:
▪ More information on electronic
records, like social media posts
▪ Proactive disclosure
requirements

Know the Law—Federal
▪ For info about the federal Freedom of Information Act, go to
the FOIA Wiki (foia.wiki)

Federal FOIA: the basics
▪ 5 U.S.C. § 552
▪ In general, provides
▪ any person (or organization)
▪ a right of access to existing
▪ records of
▪ federal
▪ executive branch
▪ agencies
▪ unless they are exempt

▪ Mostly similar for state public records laws

Before you start writing
▪ Discuss your idea/plan with your editor and/or colleagues to
clarify your goal(s), get tips, and figure out timeline
▪ If you have a choice between federal FOIA and state public
records law, consider the latter
▪ Or maybe both! Or multiple local/state entities. Be the octopus.
▪ Think about records requests as fruit!

How to start
▪ The basic process of filing a
federal FOIA request is easy.
There are three requirements:
▪ (1) Written request
▪ (2) “Reasonably describe” the
records sought
▪ (3) Follow agency regulations

▪ Look at the agency
regulations/website
▪ e.g., Treasury Department

▪ How do you know where the
agency regs/website are?
▪ foia.wiki!

▪ Mostly similar for states

What to ask for?
▪ Public records laws generally apply to records that already exist
and can be reproduced, but define “records” broadly
▪ Think about asking for a wide variety of electronic records
▪ Email
▪ Text messages
▪ Messaging apps—Facebook Messenger, iMessage, WhatsApp,
Signal, Confide, G-Chat, Slack messages
▪ Call logs

▪ Communications to/from PR shops are often illuminating

Framing the Request
▪ Think carefully about each and every word of what you ask
for
▪ As a general rule, ask for precisely what you need; nothing more,
and nothing less
▪ Tradeoff between scope of records and timeliness of response
▪ Consider using keywords, dates, individuals, and locations as
limiting factors

▪ After you write your request, try reading it from the
perspective of the records officer
▪ Volunteer?
▪ “I’m requesting all emails including attachments between Simone
and John regarding IT contracts since June 2017”

Two Kinds of Requests
▪ The Targeted Request
▪ Asks for something specific that you already know exists.
▪ Provide all detail you have
▪ If possible, provide title, date, author, office, etc.
▪ BUT, think about how you know the record exists

Two Kinds of Requests
▪ The Exploratory Request
▪ Asks for in the hopes of finding something interesting
▪ Must still satisfy the specificity requirement of the relevant law
▪ Words to avoid:
▪ “all documents pertaining to” X
▪ “all documents related to” Y
▪ ”all documents concerning” Z

▪ Consider keyword searches
▪ e.g., all records that contain or reference “budget”

Examples
▪ The targeted request:
▪ "The memo from the City Auditor to the Mayor titled “FY2017
Report” and dated April 13, 2018."

▪ The exploratory request:
▪ "All emails from Ben Carson to email addresses ending in *.com that
were sent between June 1, 2017 and July 30, 2017.”
▪ "All text messages to or from the police chief that contain the words
“octopus” or “octopuses” since 2018.

Records Systems
▪ Sometimes, it can be helpful to include information about
agency records systems in the request
▪ State/local requests:
▪ Call the public records office before hand! Especially important
for databases
▪ Consider researching record retention schedules from archives,
secretary of state, etc.

▪ Federal FOIAs:
▪ FOIA Mapper (www.foiamapper.com) and foia.wiki
▪ Federal example: FBI & Central Records System (CRS)

Records format issues
▪ Specify the format of the records you want them in!
Especially important for electronic records, like databases

Expedited Processing?
▪ Federal FOIA authorizes agencies to use multitrack
processing

Fees
▪ Under Federal FOIA, agencies may
various kinds of fees, unless you are
entitled to a fee benefit or a fee waiver.
▪ Similar provisions in most state laws
▪ It’s probably a good idea to include a
statement in your request of how much you
are willing to pay
▪ E.g., “I am willing to pay up to $ 20 to
process my request. Please inform me if the
fees will exceed that amount before
proceeding.”

Fee categorization
▪ Under the federal FOIA, if you are a representative of the
news media, and the records are not sought for commercial
use, fees are limited to cost of duplication.
▪ You also get first 100 pages free, then ~$0.05 - $0.15/page after
that, or the actual direct cost of the copy (e.g., if in electronic
form)

▪ Be sure you identify yourself as a representative of the news
media!
▪ NJ: fees generally limited to direct cost of duplication of
records (ask for them electronically!)
▪ NY: fees generally limited to duplication

Fee waiver
▪ Under federal FOIA, agency must grant fee waiver “if disclosure
of the information is in the public interest because it is
▪ likely to contribute significantly
▪ to public understanding
▪ of the operations or activities of the government
▪ and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.

▪ State fee waiver provisions vary by jurisdiction
▪ NY: no fee waiver provision
▪ NJ: no fee waiver provision
▪ PA: agency may waive duplication fees if it “deems it is in the public
interest to do so.
65 P.S. § 67.1307
▪ Even if there’s no provision in the law, you can ask!

Sending it in
▪ State/local: varies
▪ Most accept via email

▪ Federal: Check the agency website and regs
▪ Some accept via email/electronic portal, some by fax, some by
snail mail
▪ If mailing/faxing, be sure to CLEARLY mark it as a FOIA request
on the outside/cover sheet

▪ DOCUMENT EVERYTHING!
▪ This will make you, your editors, and your lawyers happy later on
▪ iFOIA has built-in features for this

RCFP’s iFOIA 2.0

Disappointment
▪ Unfortunately, the statutory deadlines for public records
requests are not always followed, and for federal FOIA
requests are rarely followed.
▪ Redactions and withholdings are increasingly common.

Addressing Delay
▪ Make friends
▪ Follow up!
▪ Ask for estimated date of completion
▪ Consider negotiating/limiting request

▪ Talk to your editor/attorney
▪ Consider writing a story

Turning up the heat: denials and delay
▪ State/local avenues
▪ Administrative appeal within the agency
▪ New York

▪ Ombudsperson/Independent agency review
▪ Pennsylvania Office of Open Records
▪ New York State Committee on Open Government
▪ New Jersey Government Records Council

▪ Federal
▪ Administrative appeal
▪ OGIS
