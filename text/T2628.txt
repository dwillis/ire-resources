Web sites and search techniques for reporters
Internet 101: Better search techniques for the Web

Search Engine: A searchable online database of Internet resources.
Components: Search engine software (to index Web pages and generate results pages), spider software
(to crawl the Web for page data to index), an index (database), and a relevancy algorithm (rules for
ranking). There are many types of search engines: general, medical, engineering, news, blogs, podcasts.
Advice: 1) Read the help page for the search engine you use most often. 2) Set up alerts for major
projects. 3) Stay informed about the type of search engine you favor (and its competitors) by reading
SearchEngineWatch.com.

Major Search Engines like Google.com & Yahoo.com
Cheatsheets:

Yahoo http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/ysearch/tips/tips-01.html
Google http://www.google.com/help/features.html

Complex searches: "Imette St. Guillen" ~killed "+The falls" -site:~blog
This query searches for the name “Imette St. Guillen.” All of the words in the name must appear
next to each other in this order. It searches for synonyms of the word “killed.” “The Falls” is the name of
the restaurant where Imette was last seen alive, but “The” is also a common word that most search
engines may ignore. The “+” before the word helps to insure that it will appear in the results list. Since
this is a search of a general search engine, I want to weed out opinion websites or blogs. Some blogs
contain a variation of the word in the URL. I will weed out those sites with “-site.~blog”.
What to do when:
1. Page is no longer available
Cached Links —View a snapshot of each page as it looked when indexed.
Ex: allintitle: iaha michael brown
2. Need only specific domains like government or military sites (search for “country code domains”)
Ex: site:mil OR site:gov
3. Looking for a pdf report (or xls, doc, jpg)
Ex: filetype:pdf AND “campaign finance”
4. Middle name is a problem (use wildcards)
Ex: “George * Bush” — will retrieve “George Bush,” “George W. Bush, “George Walker Bush”
Ex: “George W* Bush” — will retrieve “George W. Bush” and “George Walker Bush”
5. Need a calculator (search for internet calculators)
Ex: 5+2*2
6. Need a definition (search for dictionaries)
Ex: define podcast
7. Boolean searching
OR — Retrieves documents containing either term
AND — Retrieves documents containing both terms
1

NOT (-) — Retrieves documents that do not contain the term
8. Find out who links to your story
Ex: link:http://www.nytimes.com/technology/poguesposts

News Search Engines like news.Google.com & news.Yahoo.com
Complex searches: "Imette St. Guillen" location:ma
This query searches for stories about Imette St. Guillen in Massachusetts’s publications. Use the
advanced search page to select a date range.
What to do:
1. Need stories from the Boston Globe AND the Boston Herald
Ex: "Imette St Guillen" source:boston_globe OR source:boston_herald
2. Need stories about protest AND riots from non-US press
Ex: cartoon protest OR riot -location:usa
3. Want an email alert for breaking news sent to your in-box as-it-happens
Read the help page for information about setting up alerts

Blog/Feed Search Engines like Bloglines.com & Technorati.com
Unlike general search engines that index static pages, these search engines are notified of new
content as it happens. They act like a Yahoo Mail or Hotmail account in that you can log on to any
computer connected to the Internet to read your subscriptions.
What’s best:
1. See who is linking to and writing about: your story, your company’s website, or “that rumor”
2. Subscribe to your favorites for enterprise research
2. Search your favorites or search excluding your favorites
3. Clip articles

Video Search Engines like TVEyes Yahoo Video, and BlinkxTV
Search databases of commercial and non-commercial video broadcasts.
What’s best:
• TVEyes gives you video hits that start playing at a point right before your key words are spoken.
• Yahoo Video gives you a lot of the same control found in the Web search: domain, and format as well
as duration.
• BlinkTV gives you the ability to further limit your search to news, entertainment, radio, and podcasts.

Podcast Search Engines like Yahoo Podcasts and Podcast.net
Some audio and video programs are available only as podcasts. People love them because they
can be downloaded to a reader and played anytime, anywhere.

What’s best:
1. Find a database that lets you listen to podcasts directly from the Web and/or via a podcast reader.
Become a member of at least one of these providers so that you can read podcasts from the U.S.
Government’s podcast directory
http://www.firstgov.gov/Topics/Reference_Shelf/Libraries/Podcasts.shtml
2. If you don’t use an Ipod or a MP3 player, but you want to subscribe to a podcast, download the reader
software to your computer.
3. Read the episode information for quick facts about the source.
4. Tags are keywords that describe the podcast. Anyone can add a tag about a podcast. They are
searchable.

via your public library’s website or college library’s website.
Marquis Who's Who — use this for biographical information, but also to find experts by gender, state,
religion, political affiliation, and birthplace.
ERIC (journal articles and reports relating to education) — control your search by limiting educational
level (early childhood education, middle schools, postsecondary education, etc.), and intended audience
(parents, teachers, counselors, etc.).
PsycINFO (citations of scholarly articles and reports in psychology and related disciplines) — control
your search by limiting publication type (peer reviewed, non-peer reviewed, etc.), age groups (childhood,
neonatal, adolescence, aged, very old, etc.), population group (humans, animal, male, female, inpatient,
outpatient), and methodology (clinical case study, empirical study, literature review, treatment outcome,
etc.). This is another good source for finding experts who have published during your time-period-ofinterest.
