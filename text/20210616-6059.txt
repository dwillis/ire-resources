POLICE
INVESTIGATIONS
•

HOW OFTEN DOES YOUR POLICE DEPARTMENT
CONDUCT SEARCH WARRANTS AND RAIDS?

•

HOW OFTEN DO THEY RAID THE WRONG HOME?

•

SUCCESS RATE?

•

ASK FOR DATA OF ALL RESIDENTIAL SEARCH WARRANTS
EXECUTED. SOME POLICE CATEGORIZE THEM FOR
DRUGS, GUNS, PROPERTY AND IF AN ARREST WAS
MADE. SEE IF THEY ARE GETTING NEGATIVE RESULTS.

•

ORDER THE SEARCH WARRANT POLICY. DO THEY HAVE A
POLICY ON HOW TO DEAL WITH CHILDREN DURING
RAIDS?

•

FOIA NEGATIVE SEARCH WARRANTS, ACTUAL WARRANT
AND COMPLAINT FOR WARRANT. TELLS YOU WHAT THE
OFFICERS TOLD THE JUDGE TO CONVINCE JUDGE TO
SIGN IT.

BODY
CAMERA
VIOLATIONS
HOW OFTEN DOES A POLICE DEPARTMENT FAIL TO MONITOR
AND ENFORCE BODY CAMERA POLICIES?
DO THEY AUDIT THE PROGRAM TO SEE IF OFFICERS ARE
FAILING TO TURN THEM ON OR OPERATE THEM PROPERLY?
THEY WILL ARGUE AUDITS ARE PROTECTED BUT WE FOUND
CPD HAD QUARTERLY REPORTS THAT WERE PUBLIC.
SUMMARIZING WHETHER RANDOM REVIEWS OF OFFICERS
WERE EVEN BEING DONE.

DECAYING INFRASTRUCTURE
• METAL LIGHT POLICE RUSTING
AND DECAYING
• HOW MANY COMPLAINT REPORTS
ARE THERE BEING MADE BY THE
PUBLIC
• WE FILED A FOIA FOR ALL 311
CALL DATA MENTIONING LIGHT
POLES FALLING OR DAMAGING
PROPERTY.

FAILED MAINTENANCE
PROGRAMS
• WE FOUND THE CITY IGNORED
COMPLAINTS AND FAILED TO REPAIR
DANGEROUS POLES.

BIKE LANE DANGERS
• BIKE LANES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE A SAFE
WAY TO TRAVEL BUT WE FOUND CHICAGO
HAD MANY DANGERS AND ONCE AGAIN
WE TURNED TO 311 CALLS WHICH IS HOW
THE CITY TRACKS NON EMERGENCY CALLS.
• WE ALSO FOUND THE U.S. POSTAL SERVICE
WAS A HUGE VIOLATOR BUT BECAUSE THEY
ARE GOVERNMENT VEHICLES THEY NEVER
GET A TICKET. IN FACT THEY DON'T EVEN
HAVE LICENSE PLATES.
• CYCLISTS OFTEN CALLED TO REPORT
POTHOLES IN THE LANES, UNEVEN
PAVEMENT BUT REPAIRS WERE NOT MADE.

SIDEWALK
DANGERS
• WARNING TILES/STRIPS
MANDATED BY THE AMERICAN
DISABILITIES ACT.
• WE FOUND IN CHICAGO'S RUSH TO
INSTALL THEM INFERIOR
MATERIALS WERE USED AND THE
TILES WERE SIMPLY SCREWED TO
THE GROUND.
• EVEN CONCRETE TILES WERE
FALLING APART WITH SHARP WIRE
MESH STICKING OUT.

IN THE DAYS OF COVID
CHECK HAND DRYERS
• THE GROSS CONDITIONS REALLY REVEAL
HOW NO ONE IS CLEAINING THESE HAND
DRYERS ESPECIALLY THE DYSON HAND DRYER
WHERE YOU STICK YOUR HANDS INSIDE.
• WE SWABBED THE SURFACES AND HAD A LAB
TEST FOR DANGEROUS FORMS OF BACTERIA.
• WE FOUND FECAL MATTER AND OTHER
HARMFUL FORMS OF BACTERIA.
• FOCUS ON TRAIN STATIONS, AIRPORTS AND
SHOPPING MALLS.
