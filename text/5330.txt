Social data as a way to understand real people

(data about what people do alone and to each other)

Accountability reporting

Accountability
reporting
Social data is another source for
doing accountability reporting on
politicians:
Gov. Greg Abbott's personal
Twitter inbox is a direct line
for a group of about 3,000
users to reach Texas' top
politician, which some have
used to ask for jobs and
other favors.

Accountability
reporting
A way to understand public stances of
politicians.
This story looks at every URL
@realdonaldtrump tweeted and
summarizes them as a way to better
understand his information universe.

There are also ways to understand
how politicians speak as a group.
Partisan and ideological divides
shape which news outlets
legislators share links to on
Facebook

Tracing human actions

Who we are when we
think no one is watching

An individual’s actions over time
can help us understand how a
story unraveled (Quantified
Selfie).

Who we are when we
think no one is watching

Traces of people’s behavior…
sometimes really bad behavior

Who we are when we
think no one is watching

Precise documentation of
actions that can be more
powerful and reliable than
memory

Ideological radicalization

Ideological

Linguistic analysis of 3 billion
reddit comments (formation of
online groups)

Frequency of “cuck” across different subreddits, 2014 to 2015.(Tim Squirrell)

Social data as a way to understand technology,
its ecosystem and the algorithm

(data about machines do to humans)

Skewed information universes
(how algorithms screw with us)

Filter bubbles

Algorithmic creation of filter
bubbles leads to segregation
of information. Already existing
differences also get
exacerbated.

Performance identity creating
economic incentives to profit
from outrage

How does social behavior create
entirely new information
economies that profit heavily
from our outrage?

The way information
travels

On the Internet, visibility only
begets more visibility. Articles
don’t gain gradual popularity —
the rise in viewership is
exponential.
And low-quality information
travels at the same rate and in
the same manner as high-quality
information

Information wars
(how we try to screw with the algorithm)

How is technology
distorting information
channels?

Bot armies can amplify voices
and make 5 people appear to
represent 45,000 individuals.
To what extent are automated
accounts problematic and to
what extent are they a way for
an individual (programmer) to
express themselves.

Network analyses to detect bot
armies

What kind of data exists and
where is it?

The data they give us:
APIs

Limited data streams provided
by companies

The data you own:
Personal archives

Data compilations of your
own actions provided by the
company. You only have
access to your own account.
You can work with sources to
see if they will allow you to
gain access to theirs (please
be ethical!).

Social media

What information

Format

Facebook

The archive Messages, timeline activities

.html files (HTML web pages)

Google

Google allows us to download our own data from any google services
we may be using. This includes our email archive (delivered as an mbox
file that email clients recognize), our calendars, our photos and our
google maps locations, if applicable.

Various depending on the
product.
Email, for instance, comes as an
.mbox file that can be opened in
an email client like Thunderbird.
Other formats include:
XML
HTML
PowerPoint
Word
JSON
GeoJSON

Instagram

The company doesn’t seem to allow for a download but it seems to be
available via 3rd party apps.

LinkedIn

LinkedIn allows us to request a download an archive of our account,
which includes our activities, our profile, our contacts as

Reddit

The company doesn’t seem to allow for a download.

Tumblr

The company doesn’t seem to allow for a download but it seems to be
available via 3rd party apps.

Twitter

Twitter’s archive download includes a web site that allows us to
browse through our tweets as well as a spreadsheet of our activity.

HTML pages
.csv file

Viber

Viber allows users to request an archive of our messages.

.csv files

WhatsApp

Your WhatsApp chats can be requested as a text file to be sent to our
email.

.txt document

.csv files (Spreadsheets)

The data that’s out there:
Scraping

Scraping data from live
websites either via script or
other methods.

Scraping via javascript console

What kind of data is out there?
Good way to start is to start seeing every web site
as a source of structured data.

How do I get it?

How do you get the data? APIs
or Application Program
Interface*
*fancy word for a stream of data in
a format that robots/computers
can understand

How do I get it?

You write a script that accesses this
data stream and collects the
information you want and puts it into
a spreadsheet (.csv file).
Often, for popular APIs, there will be
a wrapper that exists in the language
of your choice.

Let’s get you started

How do I get it?

You write a script that accesses this
data stream and collects the
information you want and puts it into
a spreadsheet/.csv file.
Hooray, we already did that for you!

Things to look out for
Authentication: Different for each
company (Instagram requires app,
Twitter and Facebook don’t).
Rate limits: How often you can grab
data from an API per minute.
Scope: The kind of access you’re
getting to the data. You should read
up on their documentation. For
example, Twitter’s historical
searches go back 7 days, Facebook
mostly allows you to get your own
data and data from public groups.

Your turn!

Authentication!

Your turn!

Authentication!

http://bit.ly/nicar2017-social-data

Your turn!

1.) Open up your Terminal and go to the folder where you want to clone this
repository of code using the cd bash command.
git clone https://github.com/lamthuyvo/social-media-data-scripts.git
cd social-data-scripts

2.) Then install all the dependencies, i.e. the Python libraries we are using for these
scripts by running the following command:

Setting up
https://github.com/lamthuyvo/so
cial-media-data-scripts

pip install -r requirements.txt

3.) Make a secrets.py file that is modeled after the secrets.py.example file by going
into the scripts directory and running these bash commands
cd scripts
cp secrets.py.example secrets.py

Now you have a secrets.py file! Open it up in a text editor of your choice (like
Atom or Sublime Text!) and fill the credentials you created earlier. Don't forget to
save it!

Some caveats to keep in mind

Any caveats?

Get some context as to who uses
what.

http://bit.ly/nicar2017-social-data

Any caveats?

Be wary of the tyranny of
the loudest!

Any caveats?

Of all the people who
watched this live stream
only 3% actually
commented.

Any caveats?

People may not be who they
say they are…!

Is it a burger or is it a cat?
