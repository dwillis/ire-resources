General Tips

Use FOIA as a last resort​. Agencies are flooded with FOI requests, so filing one can
slow things down. First, peruse the agency’s website for public data. Develop sources
who can share the information. Try to find a records custodian who might be able to help
get you the records without filing a request. Ask what is readily available. Only then,
follow up with an official request for what you want.
Take an active role ​by following on your requests via emails and phone calls to the
designated FOI “agents.”
Appeal, Appeal, Appeal​. Office of the Inspector General reports show that at the
federal level journalists are more likely to get the information they want on appeal.
Get organized. ​Some journalists use FOIA trackers, others set up a separate gmail
address just for FOIAs.
