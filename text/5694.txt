25 WAYS TO STOP OR AT LEAST DELAY A STORY...

WE ALL KNOW THESE TACTICS...
1. COURT INJUNCTION
2. THREAT OF A LIBEL/SLANDER LAWSUIT
3. THREAT OF PULLING ADVERTISING OFF THE AIR
4. THREAT OF AN ENTIRE INDUSTRY BOYCOTT
BUT THESE ARE A BIT MORE ELUSIVE AND EVASIVE...THEY CALL FOR SOME CREATIVE AND
GUTSY THINKING BY BOTH YOU, YOUR MANAGEMENT AND YOUR LAWYERS...
5. BURYING YOU IN PAPER...THAT YOU HAVE TO READ...
6. BURYING YOU IN STUDIES...THAT YOU HAVE TO CHECK OUT...THAT
YOU MAY HAVE TO GET AN EXPERT TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND...
IT IS A TOUGH DILEMMA FOR MOST OF US TO DETERMINE JUST HOW
MUCH IS ENOUGH "PROOF"...BEFORE YOU KNOW IT YOU ARE BURIED
IN ARCANE ARGUMENTS...AND THAT IS JUST THE IDEA THE COMPANY
HAD IN MIND YOU SUDDENLY FIND YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE
"STUDIES" TO MORE THAN ONE EXPERT - TIME AND MONEY YOU
MANY NOT HAVE
7. COMPANY MAY HIRE AN EXPERT WHO WILL REFUTE EVERYONE OF
YOUR FINDINGS...
8. COMPANY MAY DEFAME EVERY ONE OF YOUR "EXPERTS" OR
"WITNESSES"...HOPING YOU WILL THROW THEM OUT AND START
AGAIN...OR DROP THE STORY ALL TOGETHER...
9. COMPANY MAY TELL YOU "NO INTERVIEW" UNTIL THE DAY BEFORE
YOUR STORY IS TO RUN AND THEN TELL YOU IT WILL "THINK"
ABOUT AN INTERVIEW OR EVEN DO ONE...
10. CORALLARY OF 7...COMPANY SAYS NO TO INTERVIEW...THEN AT
LAST MINUTE SAYS YES..BUT THEN CHANGES MIND AGAIN AFTER
PUTTING YOU OFF FOR A WEEK OR MORE...
11. YET ANOTHER CORALLARY TO NUMBER 7...COMPANY SAYS NO,
THEN YES, THEN OFFERS ONLY AN "EXPERT" THAT DOES NOT WORK
FOR THE COMPANY SO THAT PERSON CANNOT REALLY SPEAK WITH
AUTHORITY...
12. COMPANY OR PERSON'S LAWYER CALLS YOURS AND TELL YOUR
LAWYER YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT...
13. CORALLARY TO NUMBER 10...COMPANY OR PERSON'S

REPRESENTATIVE CALLS YOUR GM OR YOUR BOSS TO SAY YOU HAVE
BEEN VERY UNFAIR...VERY IRRESPONSIBLE OR DON'T HAVE A CLUE
WHAT YOU ARE DOING...
14. COMPANY PREEMPTS YOU AND HAS A PRESS CONFERENCE BEFORE
YOU CAN GET ON THE AIR TELLING THE PUBLIC HOW UNFAIR YOUR
TV STATION OR NEWSPAPER IS...
15. COMPANY ACTUALLY CHANGES ITS POLICY OR PRACTICE THAT YOU
HAVE SPENT MONTHS EXPOSING BEFORE YOU CAN GET ON THE
AIR...(THIS ONE IS A REAL BUMMER!)
16. COMPANY TAKES OUT A FULL PAGE AD TELLING THE CITY OR
COMMUNITY YOU LIVE IN THAT THE STORY YOU ARE ABOUT TO DO
IS FULL OF ERRORS AND MISSTATEMENTS...
17. COMPANY OR PERSON WRITES AN OP-ED PIECE OR LETTER TO THE
EDITOR OR GETS ON THE INTERNET TO TALK ABOUT YOU AND YOUR
LOUSY STORY...BEFORE YOU EVEN GET IT ON THE AIR...SOMETIMES
IT CAUSES YOU TO ADDRESS ALL KINDS OF EXTRANEOUS
MATERIAL THAT WASN'T IMPORTANT TO THE STORY IN THE FIRST
PLACE...
18. YOU ARE CHARGED WITH RACE DISCRIMINATION, DEFAMATION,
WHATEVER - NOT SOMETHING YOUR MANAGEMENT WANTS TO
HEAR...
19. THE COMPANY INTIMIDATES YOUR INTERVIEWEE (EVEN AFTER YOU
HAVE INTERVIEWED HIM/HER SO THEY TRY TO BAIL OUT OF STORY
OR STOP COOPERATING...OR RETRACT WHAT THEY SAID
20. COMPANY INSISTS ON A MEETING WITH YOUR MANAGMENT - OFF
THE RECORD...A VERY BAD IDEA...
21. CLOSE CORALLARY OF 20 - COMPANY INSISTS ON BACKGROUNDER
WITH YOUR MANAGEMENT, YOU. LAWYERS - ON THE RECORD â€“
AND SPENDS MOST OF THE TIME ATTACKING YOU..
22. A LAWSUIT IS BROUGHT OR THREATENED NOT ON LIBEL AND
SLANDER - BUT ON FACT YOU TRESPASSED IN SOME WAY...
23. A LAWSUIT IS BROUGHT OR THREATENED ON THE WAY YOU USED A
HIDDEN CAMERA...THAT SOMEHOW YOU VIOLATED STATE LAWS
24. ACCUSATIONS ARE MADE THAT YOU ARE "IN BED" (LITERALLY OR
FIGURATIVELY)WITH SOMEONE WHO IS AN EXPERT OR GROUP OR
LAWYER IN YOUR PIECE...THAT AS A RESULT YOU HAVE AN AXE TO
GRIND...
25. ACCUSATIONS ARE MADE TO YOUR MANAGEMENT THAT YOU HAVE A
VENDETTA AGAINST THE COMPANY/PERSON YOU ARE
COVERING...THAT YOUR BROTHER'S WIFE'S GRANDMOTHER WAS
RIPPED OFF BY THE VERY COMPANY YOU ARE INVESTIGATING
MAKES IT VERY HARD TO USE A RELATIVES STORY

BOTTOMLINE:
WHILE THE PROCESS IS PAINFUL - IF YOU HAVE YOUR ACT TOGETHER - IN THE END, ALL THAT
DOUBLE CHECKING AND READING WILL MAKE A BETTER STORY...
BUT IT CERTAINLY TAKES PATIENCE, ENDURANCE, GOOD HUMOR AND A BOSS WHO HAS
CONFIDENCE IN YOU.
I HAVE HAD EVERY ONE OF THESE TWENTY FIVE THINGS HAPPEN TO ME IN MY REPORTING - AND
EVERY SINGLE STORY INVOLVED MADE IT TO AIR...
SO HANG IN THERE...
