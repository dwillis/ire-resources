Remington Under Fire: A CNBC Investigation

http://RemingtonDoc.cnbc.com

There are an estimated 280 million firearms in America—almost one gun for every man, woman
and child. Set aside the politics; guns are an incredibly pervasive consumer product. But federal
law bars the government from setting safety standards for guns, or ordering recalls of defective
firearms. Instead, manufacturers are left to police themselves.
Remington Under Fire: A CNBC Investigation examined the most popular bolt-action rifle in the
world—Remington’s 700 series, with more than five million sold. First developed after World
War II, the 700 series, and in particular its unique firing mechanism, became popular not just with
amateur hunters but also with police and the military—all of whom prized its accuracy and
smooth trigger pull. But our investigation found something else about the 700 series: a trail of
complaints, injuries and deaths; and evidence the company knew about a design flaw since before
the product went on the market, but kept vital information from the public.
The investigation began with Richard Barber of Bozeman, Montana, whose nine-year-old son
died in a hunting accident in 2000. Barber would spend the next ten years studying the inner
workings of the firing mechanism and gathering literally millions of pages of internal documents
from Remington and its parent companies.
Barber’s trove of documents was a starting point for CNBC’s investigation, which examined
Remington, its corporate owners, its distribution chain, and customers including the U.S. military.
We found at least two dozen deaths linked to inadvertent discharges of the rifles, more than 100
serious injuries, and more than 75 lawsuits—most of them quietly settled, the details hidden from
the public by confidentiality agreements.
Following our report, at least one police agency stopped using the rifles, the U.S. Border Patrol
moved to retrofit its rifles, and literally hundreds of viewers have written in to recount their
experiences, unaware until they saw our program that they were not alone. Soon after our
program, Remington’s parent company withdrew plans for an initial public stock offering.
TIPS
1. Throw out the agenda. Make no mistake: after your story runs, you will be accused of
promoting a liberal-media, anti-gun agenda. Don’t hand your critics, uh, ammunition.
Nearly all gun owners are honorable, law-abiding citizens using a legal product they have
a right to own. They also have a right to expect that product to be designed and built
safely. Stick to the facts, and let others debate the policy. Every person we interviewed in
Remington Under Fire was pro-gun.
2. Broaden your definition of “consumer.” One of the biggest buyers of firearms—and
many other products for that matter—is the government. Police and the military monitor
their vendors’ contract compliance, creating a paper trail we were able to access through
FOIA requests. Most federal contracts—and the specifications—are public record. To

search for current and past solicitations, go to https://www.fbo.gov. Local agencies will
also have contracting procedures.
What has the company disclosed? While Remington and its parent companies were
generally uncooperative with us, they were required to disclose information to their
investors. Search the SEC’s EDGAR database,
http://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/webusers.htm. In a company’s annual reports
(Form 10-K), quarterly reports (Form 10-Q) or prospectuses (Form S-1), search for legal
proceedings or product liability. Take special note if the company has amended its
filings. What changed?
Court the courts. While many product liability cases are settled out of court and kept
quiet through confidentiality agreements, the filings leading up to the settlement, as well
as the initial complaint, usually remain public. Invest in a PACER account to access
federal court documents at http://www.pacer.gov.
Mine the message boards. Like the users of any popular product, gun owners often share
their experiences online. There are many discussion forums where you can search for
information about the product you are investigating. One is run by Graybeard Outdoors at
http://www.go2gbo.com.
Go shopping. The retailer is on the front line, and is a part of the story regardless of
whether the sales force has been made aware of a potential issue. In Remington Under
Fire, we used hidden cameras in several states, and found salespeople were not informing
customers about the complaints. This occurred even at one national retailer whose
chairman used to be the CEO of Remington.
Need a gut check? While federal law specifically bars the Consumer Product Safety
Commission from regulating firearms, the agency does regulate other weapons with
firing mechanisms, such as air rifles and crossbows. Search current and past recalls at
http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prerel.html?tab=recalls. While not a direct
comparison, we found the agency had mandated recalls over issues strikingly similar to
the ones reported in the Remington rifles, sometimes without a single reported incident.
