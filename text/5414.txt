Exploring racial bias
As some of you may know, our newspaper is working on
its third installment of a series about bias in Florida’s
criminal justice system.
That series derives from our exploration of two
databases:
The Offender Based Transaction System, or OBTS,
which contains more than 80 million records.
And a much smaller database – containing about 1.4
million records -- complied by the Department of
Corrections

Love Affair
Both databases have their attributes, but the one we really
fell in love with is OBTS.
That’s because it’s so big and rich with information - and it’s
so difficult to work with.
If you printed it out
it would take up
one lane of
highway stretching
262 miles -- About
the distance from
Chicago to Detroit.

Bubba Justice
It was Paige St. John, a 2011 Pulitzer
Prize winner, who came across the
OBTS database.
She intended to use it to write a series of
stories dubbed “Bubba Justice.”
Her thesis was that Florida’s rural counties would be far
more biased in their sentencing than big cities like Orlando,
Miami and Jacksonville.
But Paige left the Herald-Tribune for the LA times before she
got a chance to test her thesis.

Computer Assisted Cavemen
Our team inherited Paige’s data,
but we had problems accessing
it.
Paige stored her disks in a hot
Florida garage and some of
them warped.
We couldn’t open them.
Our IT staff couldn’t open them.
So we turned to the Tampa Bay
Times for help.
Bill Higgins, their data guru at
the time, downloaded the data
for us and made it searchable
using PostreSQL.

Boiling it down
Boiling it down
Our next great challenge was to get rid of duplicates –
and OBTS has a ton of them.
The database tracks criminal defendants from arrest,
through sentencing and appeal.
Every time something significant happens in a case – a
defense attorney is hired, a new judge is appointed, a
verdict is reached – a new line of data is created.
It took us more than six months to figure out how to boil
down the dupes.

Apples to apples
OBTS showed us that bias is
rampant in Florida’s criminal
justice system.
But critics said there was a
fundamental flaw in our
analysis – the inability to
compare apples to apples
Though OBTS clearly shows that blacks are arrested and convicted
more often than whites - and spend far longer in lockup - there is no
way to make sure that black and white defendants are being treated
equally – no way perfect way to ensure that disparities aren’t caused by
blacks having longer rap sheets or by having committed more serious
crimes.

Clean comparisons
That’s where our second database from
the Department of Corrections proved
invaluable.

Felony Level

Points

1

0-3.9

2

4-15.9

Though much smaller than OBTS, DOC
contains an crucial field with points
scored by defendants at sentencing.

3

16-21.9

4

22-27.9

5

28-35.9

The points are key a system set up by
Florida’s legislature in the 1990s to
ensure criminals from Pensacola to Key
West are sentenced fairly – regardless
of their sex, race or financial
wherewithal.

6

36-55.9

7

56-73.9

8

74-91.9

9

92 -

The system provides a formula
whereby prosecutors and judges can
determine sentence length based on
the total pointed scored.

FORMULA
(Points – 28) x .75 = Months in Lockup
56-28 = 28 x .75 = 21 months

Bias Reigns in Florida
With DOC, we were able to compare defendants who
scored the same number of points and to show that bias
exists in almost every part of the state

Judging the judges
Three of the four main stories in our ‘Bias on the
bench’ series were supported by DOC data.
But – still in love with OBTS – we used that
database for our fourth story – and that’s where we
ran into most trouble.
That story compared 450 sitting and recently
retired judges according their disparities in
sentencing for six specific crimes and three broad
categories of felonies.
It also compared judges based on their political
persuasions.

Black Republicans
It showed how black Republican judges were both the most
lenient and the most biased – sending black defendants to
an average 70 percent more time in lockup than white
defendants for 3rd degree felonies

Judges were not happy with our conclusions.
Determined to undermine our credibility, they wrote
a letters to the Goldsmith Prize, after we had
been named a finalist.
They also sent similar letters to the Selden Ring,
Pulitzer and other awards arguing we should not
win.

All out war
The chief judge in our home circuit even
recruited a computer science professor
from nearby New College of Florida to
challenge our methodology and
conclusions.
He then used a study authored by that
professor to block legislation spawned by
our series that would have mandated the
use of data to ensure equity in
sentencing.
We fought back, writing a story proving
the professor’s analysis was fatally
flawed.
But it was too late for legislative impact in
2017.

Blame the prosecutors
We had prepared to pivot to a series about government
corruption, but our fight with the judges ate up the first
few months of the year.
Not sure whether we could deliver a project on a fresh
topic by year’s end, we opted to spend a second year on
bias – looking at disparities in sentencing in Florida’s war
on drugs and the role of prosecutors.

Back to OBTS
In their rebuttal to ‘Bias on the bench’, judges argued
that they weren’t responsible disparities in sentencing.
They pointed out that over 95 percent of cases are
settled through plea bargains – a process controlled by
prosecutors.
So if anyone was to blame, it was the prosecutors and
the plea negotiation process.
We wanted to see if they were right.
But we couldn’t use DOC this time around because it
doesn’t contain enough information about prosecutors.
So we turned back to OBTS.

Regional Differences
The database showed us that certain counties have wide disparities when it
comes to sentencing blacks defendants busted for felony drug crimes.
Other counties are far more fair.

After some initial reporting, we hypothesized
that power in the criminal justice system is not
uniform.
In one county, for example, the sheriff holds sway.
He dictates who is arrested. The overwhelming majority
are black and disparities are wide.
In another county, judges are more influential.
They are not afraid to get involved in plea deals – and
disparities are narrower.
In a third county, the public defender
likes to litigate. Assured of a liberal jury pool, she threatens to
take cases to trial to force prosecutors to negotiate better plea
deals.
In another county just a few miles to the north - the public
defender has close ties to prosecutors and rarely litigates – so
sentencing disparities are wide.

§.

Wrong approach
The story looked promising,
But a data savvy reporter from the Jacksonville Times Union
who was working with us at the time - found a flaw:
We were basing our conclusions on charge-level data not
defendant-level data.
And it matters.
Defendants are often charged with more than one crime possession of a weapon, possession of cocaine, possession
of drug paraphernalia, trespassing, etc.
Those crimes may get them a year in jail. But using chargelevel data, that year-long sentence can be doubled, tripled or
quadrupled or more.

Rush to the finish
Because of this problem, we postponed writing about prosecutors and
rushed to finish a series about bias in Florida’s war on drugs.
We temporarily abandoned OBTS and turned back to our ever reliable
Department of Corrections data.
The data show immense disparities in sentencing for blacks and whites
convicted of buying or selling drugs within 1,000 feet or a church or school or
other drug free zone.

Questioning the data
Three weeks after we
published, we received an
email from the Broward
County state attorney’s
office saying our
conclusions must be
wrong.
There’s no way Broward
sentences blacks busted
in drug-free zones to five
times as long as whites.
Unfortunately, they were
correct.

Avoidable Mistakes
The Broward data, compiled by court clerks and sent
on to the Department of Corrections was riddled with
errors.
Clerks entered the wrong sentence in 1 out of every 4
cases in the 730-case sample.
In one instance, a 65-year sentence was entered as
650 years.
We should have seen that error.
But we were so confident in the DOC data from using it
for the first series - and we were so rushed to complete
our second series by the end of the calendar year that we failed to check.
So we had to write a correction.

Saving grace
§ The saving grace was that problems in Broward were unique to
that circuit. (Error rates in other circuits we tested were under
five percent.)
Also, after opening all 730
cases and correcting the
sentences, Broward
County’s racial disparities in
sentencing were still pretty
ridiculous.
Blacks busted in drug free
zones were sentenced to
three times more lockup.

The cleaned data
revealed that whites
were repeatedly shown
lenience. In fact, in all
our research we never
came across a better
examples of bias.
In turn, Broward’s
deputy state attorney
confessed that his office
completely ignores the
point system, which was
set up to ensure equity
in sentencing.
So we wrote a story
that corrected our
mistake and pointed out
the bias in Broward
County state attorney’s
office in the process.

Conclusions:
Data is seductive.
The bigger and more complicated it is – the more you want to use it.
Data is also dangerous.
There are so many things that can go wrong and so many variables you can’t control.
Sure OBTS showed us that blacks are treated more harshly than whites – but maybe
that’s because they have more priors and commit more serious crimes.
Using charge level or defendant level data makes a difference,
and there is no assurance that data provided by court clerks and government
agencies is error free.
As my Middle Ages history professor once told me – “Data is notoriously unreliable
because it was often collected by the village idiot.”
Most important and most obvious lesson from all this: DON’T RUSH.
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO OPEN THE DATA AND EXAMINE
WHAT MIGHT BE CAUSING THE DISPARITIES.
AVOID PUBLISHING IN DECEMBER.

on
That said, I don’t think the problems associated
s:
with data should paralyze any of us from using it.
Even with our blunders, our pioneering use of
OBTS and DOC is changing the criminal justice
system in Florida.
Judges and prosecutors genuinely fear how data
will depict them, which is impacting their decision
making.
And many see how data can be used to make
the system more equitable.
A bill that is about to pass the state legislature
calling for improvements in the collection of data
and its use to ensure equity in sentencing.

Getting your hands on it
To get your hands it, you might have to ask for it for
research purposes. That’s what we had to do.
This is what we wrote:
This data is intended solely for research purposes.
Individual defendant names and case identifiers can be
converted to unique identifiers (such as hash keys) that
cannot be used to link to real persons, as along as it is
replaced with an alpha-numeric code that uniquely
identifies each individual in the database and each
case number within the database.

Possible stories
Racial discrimination in sentencing is the low hanging fruit
when it comes to investigating the criminal justice system
OBTS and DOC data can be used for lots of other stories.
Take VOP, for example - Defendants who violate probation can
end up with crazy jail time.
Or maybe you want to compare outcomes for private attorneys
and public defendants
Or you want to see which judges are the most lenient when it
comes to DUI and which are the harshest when it comes to
drug crimes.
And what about sex crimes? No reporter wants to touch them
because the perpetrators are so unsympathetic. But the data is
there and the land is untilled.
