BACKGROUNDING LIKE A BOSS
Perfecting your 15-minute background check and why you should do it every time

Do I really have to background EVERYONE?
-Even just a “person on the street?”

Do I really have to background EVERYONE?
-Even just a man on the street?

Meet Dan Benedict!
-

Former Green Beret and nurse
-

Leader of new nonprofit
devoted to rescuing exploited
girls and women from traffickers
-

Florida Times-Union,
Nov. 12, 2010

Born-again Christian

… Convicted of a sexual offense,
white separatist, named in federal
weapons stockpile case

BUT IN MY
DEFENSE.

They had t-shirts!

They had
confidential
people fighting
in camo!

Was this my fault?

Yes, OK. It was.
I didn't have a system to check sources out.
I also didn't listen to my gut.

What should my red flags have been?
- First of all, he literally told me he had a hero complex.
- Military background was likely
exaggerated
- Some people just feel like liars

What should my system look like?
Every person MUST BE CHECKED on a basic level,
-- but every person doesn't need every check
What aspects of this person’s background are relevant?
Keep a list of sites handy for your community

Google the heck out of them
How many different ways?
As many as you can think of,
and go three pages in.
At least search: whole name (in and
out of quotes) and organization,
whole name (in and out of quotes)
and city/state, last name and
organization, whole name in quotes
and mugshot.

Check your organization’s/
your competitor’s archives or Nexis
This should be your first stop
for all stories anyway.
Sometimes that guy at the council
meeting gives you the perfect quote
because he's been saying the same
thing to reporters for years.

Court records
Civil Courts:
Marriage, child support and divorce filings
Debt collection attempts
Orders of protection requests (the type of court varies)
Criminal Courts – name, probably a DOB
Any criminal cases, traffic tickets
Assessors office:
Property records, unpaid taxes

Professional licenses
Does this person say she is a
doctor or a nurse? Make sure.
Same goes for any field that
requires a license.
Look for valid licenses AND any
disciplinary actions.

Military service
Find out as much information as you can about the subject, such
as military service branch, DOB, SSN, likely years of service, etc.
Ask them to show you their DD214 (Certificate of Release or
Discharge from Active Duty)
FOIAs are the next best way. Without permission, info is limited.
But military doesn’t want fakers claiming medals

There isn’t an easy record for everything

That doesn’t mean you can’t
check it out!

Tribal affiliations
- Is a tribe federally or state-recognized? Check Bureau of Indian
Affairs. Check with the state to see if it’s state-recognized.
- Ask: are you an enrolled member/citizen of a tribe?
- Sometimes enrollment offices will confirm a member.
Cherokee Nation has a list of fake tribes.

Trans sources
First of all, with VERY few exceptions, learning someone is gay,
trans, etc. is not a scoop.
It might be necessary to verify some aspects of a person’s history.
If you need a person’s dead name to do that, make clear why you
need it and how you intend to use that information.
Be sure your editors/copy desk are in the loop on your source’s
pronouns, and you might want to circulate an internal note for
copy edits.

Undocumented immigrants
If the person has an immigration case or history, ask for:
-A-number
- DOB
- Country of origin
Latinx and other double names are OFTEN wrong, misspelled,
inverted, etc. in court records.
Don’t overlook the value of a couple additional sources - family
members, neighbors - to vouch for someone when the traditional
route won’t work.

Survivors of sexual assault
There may not be an official report (reliability of these vary too)
but you can still verify an accusation.
• Talking to folks close to the source to help corroborate
• Therapist’s notes (with permission)
• Text exchanges and screen shots

Get old school
Call someone who
would know.
Phone book, city
guides,
church directories

What if something DOES turn up?
Consider the history and usage “no angel/troubled past” framing
Would this person be famous if something bad/high-profile didn’t
happen to them?
Does their past relate to this issue?
Does being a victim of a crime
Understand the realities of the internet

Facts aren’t necessarily stories

Finding the context is on you, not police
reports

Pay attention to your red flags

But pay attention to your red flags

What if you do everything right and still
miss something?
It happens.
Own up to it and make it right.
If there’s a victim, honor that person - and save the next
reporter.

Make your own checklist!
