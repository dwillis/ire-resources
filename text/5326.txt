This is an IRS Form 990

New Data

What’s online
More than 2 million IRS
filings processed since
2011
• Form 990
• Form 990EZ
• Form 990PF

What’s missing
• Organizations that file by paper
• Tiny groups that file a 990-N
• Nonprofits that don’t file at all
• Forms that haven’t been processed yet
• Forms processed before 2011

Also missing: Cats.

Format: XML

Key data in tags

How to find files

Indexes

–JSON
–CSV

JSON

CSV

Computer Programing Time!

Todd’s approach
Write scripts to:
1) Download index files
2) Download every XML file listed in indexes
3) Loop through XML files
4) Grab key fields
5) Save data in new CSV files

Andrea’s approach
• Download the JSON files with Python
• Parse the JSON and put the information into a SQL
table

Andrea’s approach contd.
• Get the URLS from the JSON files and download all
the XML files

Andrea’s approach contd.
• Parse every data point in each XML file to get:
– Filename
– Sequence number (for repeated tags)
– Field name and parent fields
– Value of the field

Andrea’s approach contd.
• Write each field/value pairing to a text file
• Upload text file to SQL Server

Andrea’s approach contd.
Figure out the field maps

Make your tables

Caveats with data
• Amended forms
• Typos in forms
• Missing tags/fields
• 1/True = Yes. 0/False = “No.”
• Tags can vary between forms and years. For
instance:
2016 form: <FormationYr>1994</FormationYr>
2013 form: <YearFormation>1994</YearFormation>
