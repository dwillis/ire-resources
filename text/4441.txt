Reshaping data in Excel (PC Only):
• 
Download Excel data reshaper:
http://kb.tableau.com/articles/knowledgebase/addin-reshaping-data-excel
• 
Open your spreadsheet in Excel (Dispositions)
• 
Remove all excess columns and rows
• 
Change duplicate categories ("Other")
• 
Go to the Tableau tab on the menu bar
• 
Select the cell on the axis of the data where you want to reshape
• 
Click "Reshape data"
• 
Name your columns
• 
Name your tab
• 
Save
• 
Keep open — it will help you for reference
Parsing out reshaped data in Tableau:
• 
Click “Connect to data” in top right panel
• 
Select data type (Excel)
• 
Select “Dispositions reshaped”
• 
Drag the sheet (“Dispositions reshaped” into the data window.
• 
Select “extract”
• 
Check your column headers to make sure you have the correct data type
• 
Change “Year” to string
• 
Click “Go to Worksheet”
• 
It’s going to ask you where you want to save your extracts. For sanity’s
sake, make a new folder for these to reduce clutter.
Dimensions vs. Measures
• 
A simple way to think about this is — dimensions are strings or dates
(including numbers that act as strings, such as unique identifiers, or attributes
like zip codes). Measures are numbers.
• 
Dimensions are independent variables, like the precinct, measures are
dependent variables or attributes, like the number of crimes in that precinct.
Another important thing:
• 
Backward and forward button — you can undo and redo as much as you

want.
We’re going to look at the felony conviction rate by precinct to see which ones have
the highest and lowest conviction rates
•
•
•
•


In the panel on the left hand side, drag “Number” from Dimensions to
Measures

Drag reporting agency into “Rows”

Drag “Year” into “Columns”

Drag “Number” into the area of the table that you want to populate with
a number

Now you need to start filtering:
• 
First, you know that there is both a whole number and a percentage for
each year.
• 
Drag “N or %” into filters and choose “%”
• 
Format this in order to make it easier to read: Right-click “(SUM)Number”
in the “Marks” panel, select “Numbers” under default, “Percentage”
• 
Now drag “Category 1” into filters.
• 
Choose only the two convicted categories
• 
Now drag “Type” into filters and choose only “Felony”
• 
Check against your original spreadsheet to make sure you did the filter
correctly.
• 
If you want to see both the number and percentage, drag “N or %” out of
filters, then drag it either above or below your “Year” column depending on how
you want the table structured.
• 
Now you can sort the table to identify the highest and the lowest
conviction rates for felonies.
• 
To export the table into an Excel spreadsheet, go to Worksheet in the
menu bar, click “Export,” “Crosstab to Excel”
SUBWAY DATA
• 
Familiarize yourself with the data. First, note the number of records in
your data set — 47,943 — this is how you check your work.
• 
One very important note is that these crimes are marked by “post,”
which is roughly equivalent to a platform, not by station. Stations with more
than one line will have multiple posts. More on this later.
• 
Connect to data: MTA Crime
• 
Check your data types
• 
Choose “extract” and “Go to Worksheet”
•


If you drag “Post” into “Rows,” you will see that there are 479 posts in
the NYC subway system. There are 421 stations, which means you need to group

•
•
•

•

posts into stations.

Drag “Station/ Line” next to “Post” in the “Rows” shelf.

You’ll see that Times Square has multiple posts. We want to look at crime
by both post and station, so we’re going to group some of them.

You’ll also note (if you know the subway system) that the NYPD’s name
for these posts are incorrect — for example, there is no longer a 9 train and the
Q doesn’t stop at West 4th Street. I had to actually find the old map the NYPD
based its names on (it was from 1998) and manually fix all of these since there
was no way to confidentially automate the process, given that some lines were
partially as they are today.

To correct the name, right click on one of the stations and select “Edit
Alias” and correct the station/ line name.

Grouping:
• 
Click on one of the 59 St-Columbus Circle posts, hold the shift key, click
on the other one, and select “group”
• 
Now you’ll see that “Station/Line (group)” has appeared in your
dimensions panel. Right click the “Station/Line (group)” in the dimensions
panel and select “Edit Group”
• 
If you scroll down, you’ll see your 59th Street/ Columbus Circle station.
• 
If you double-click, you can change the name.
• 
We’ll create a few other groups in here. Go to 42 St-Grand Central and
create a group for the 4,5,6,7,S lines.
• 
District Offices (Off-System — right click and select “Add to”)
• 
14 ST-UNION SQ — to group ones that aren’t adjacent in the list, use
command instead of shift
Counting number of records:
• 
Remove the group and replace it with “Station names (group)” – I added
this column to the data for us. After I grouped all the stations, I exported a table
with the post and the station name and then joined that table with the original
data by post.
• 
Drag “Number of Records” into the table where you want to see the
numbers — this is just counting the number of records for each station.
Dates and Time:
• 
Now lets filter by date, because this data was only from July 2008 - June
2013.
• 
Drag “Date” in your columns shelf and now you have a crime count by
year.
• 
If you right click on date, you can select the format Year/ Quarter
Line charts and other views:

•

•


You can select how to view the data by clicking the “Show Me” window.
We’re going to mainly be looking at tables, but if you select the line chart, you
can see a line chart for each station. If you drag “station” out of the rows shelf,
you can see the total for the entire subway system.

If you drag “Station” back into “color” in the “Marks” panel, you will see
all of the stations in one chart, which could be useful for quickly identifying
trends and outliers.

Now if you click the table view under “Show Me,” it will take you back to
your table.

Time:
• 
Clear your view. Now drag “Time” into the rows shelf. Right-click the pill
and format it to “Hour”
• 
If you don’t want to look at military time format, right-click the pill, select
“format,” and then under “Dates,” select “12-hour.”
• 
Now drag “Number of Records” into the sheet and you will see the crime
by hour.
• 
If you view this as a line chart, you can clearly see that the after-school
hour of 3 p.m. has by far the most crime reports.
• 
However, not all crimes are most prevalent at the same hours.
• 
Drag “classification” into “color” in the marks panel (note that these
classifications aren’t grouped – I spent a lot of time doing this based on the
criminal code.)
• 
It’s difficult to see the crimes you want when there are so many, so also
drag “classification” into filters.
• 
Select assault, forcible touching, grand larceny and click ok. You can also
right-click “Classification” in the filters pane and choose to show the quick filter
so you can quickly change between views.
• 
Now you can see that forcible touching (groping) peaks during the
morning rush hour. Assault peaks during the after-school hours. Grand larceny
seems to have several peaks throughout the day, both during the rush hours and
the hours when the fewest people are on the train.

•


Select to view this as a table

Remove hour from the columns shelf and replace it with period. I
grouped the hours into periods.

Remove classification from quick filter.

In the table area, drag “Morning” to the first column so your time periods
are in chronological order.

Now you can sort each column and see which crimes are most prevalent
during each time period.

You could replace “classification” with “Station/Line” and see which

•
•
•

platforms have the most crimes during the various time periods.

Now drag “classification” into the filters shelf and choose only forcible
touching.

Under “analysis” in the menu bar, choose “totals” and “show row grand
totals.”

Sort by grand total — Grand Central has the most forcible touching
incidents. We also found that roughly half of the forcible touching incidents in
the entire subway system were reported along a stretch of the 4,5,6 line in
Manhattan, which is the most crowded train line in the nation.

Joining tables:
• 
In the menu bar, select “data” and “connect to data”
• 
Select file type - microsoft excel.
• 
Choose “Ridership data.”
• 
Drag all your Year columns into Measures — they are a measure
• 
In the menu bar, click “data” and “edit relationships.”
• 
Click “custom” and “add” and join “tableau station name” and “station
names (group)”
Calculating a crime rate per 100,000 riders (We’ll use only 2009-2012 since that’s when
the data overlaps)
Creating a calculated field:
•
•
•
•
•
•

•
•
•


In the data section of the panel, choose your ridership data. Right click
one of the year columns and select “create calculated field.”

Write a calculation that adds 2009-2012:
[2009Yr]+[2010Yr]+[2011Yr]+[2012Yr]

Name it Ridership 2009-12

Click Ok

In the data section of the panel, chose your MTA crime data. Right click in
the measures window and create a calculated field.

Write a calculation that will count the number of times each station
group comes up in the data set:
COUNT([Station names (group)])

(You can type COUNT and then double-click “Station Names (group) but
you have to put parenthesis around the brackets.)

Name it COUNT crime by station

Right click in measures and create a calculated field. We are going to
divide crimes by 1,000 riders:

[COUNT crime by station]/(SUM([Sheet1 (Ridership data)].[Ridership
2009-12])/1000)
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•


Drag Station Names (Group) in your rows.

Drag dates in the filter shelf and select only 2009-2012.

Drag your crime count and crime rate in the sheet, and from the MTA
data drag ridership into the sheet, just to check your work.

Format crime rate to see three decimals.

If you want to change your calculation to 100,000 riders, just right click
the calculated field, select edit, and add two zeros.

Under “analysis” in the menu bar, choose totals and show column grand
totals, so when you scroll to the bottom you’ll see the citywide average.

Now you’ll see that even though Times Square has the most crimes in the
system, broad channel has the highest crime rate.

You can filter this as well to see rates per crime type, for example.
