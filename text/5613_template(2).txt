PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST VIA EMAIL
Dear Public Records Specialist,
Pursuant to the state Open Records Act, Wash. Rev. Code Ann. Secs 42.56.001 to 42.56.902, I
request access to and electronic copies of a database or other such record related to employees at
your agency/commission/office/board/department on job reassignment or alternate assignment
from years 2012 to present – for cases where the employee is on reassignment while being
investigated for allegations of wrong-doing.
This request should include records providing the following:
 Employee name
 Position
 Pay rate/salary
 Beginning and ending dates of the alternate assignment
 Disposition: Termination? Settlement? Back to work?
As provided by statute, I request to receive these records as they become available as opposed to
waiting for the entire request to be ready for inspection or disclosure.
Please don’t hesitate to call or email with any questions or needed clarification.
Sincerely,
Susannah Frame
