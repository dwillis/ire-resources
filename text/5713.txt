How can we use court records to
pinpoint the effects of
the plea bargain system on
defendants?

Preparation and Initial Analysis
●
●

●

Built data dictionary and reviewed with
expert source
Exploratory analysis: pleas by judge,
jurisdiction, prosecutor, public defender/
attorney
Deprioritization of bail across state

Homing in on Baltimore Police Corruption
●

Analysis of cases vacated in connection to Gun Trace Task Force
○
○
○

●
●

How many pleaded guilty?
How many were in custody when they pled guilty?
How do these rates compare to the rest of the city (same charges during
same period)?

How many more Baltimore cases involved each of the implicated
officers?
When did evidence against the officers first surface?

Problems
●

●

Incorrect or unclear data -- and few people to consult
○ Missing pleas and dispositions
○ Record structure differs by jurisdiction
○ Early pleas get overwritten by later ones
○ Unclear codes
Police officers’ names briefly disappeared from case search
