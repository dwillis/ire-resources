IRE Tipsheet: Rustling Up Records

To get records, you usually go through people. Establish and cultivate relationships.
Instead of just shooting off an email, call or visit. Ask for advice. Say thank you.
With records, there is often a first cut — and then there are the layers beneath. You want
the deep cut.
Don’t apologize for requesting public records. Just don’t.
Don’t let a request die through neglect. That, too, sends a bad message.
Ask for the same records from multiple agencies. One agency might interpret an
exemption broadly, another, narrowly. One agency might act in good faith, another, not
so much.
If an agency that created a record won’t give it up, think of other agencies that might
have received a copy. With FOIA what matters is possession, not production.
While we’re dutifully filing FOIAs, merging databases and converting our paper
documents into searchable PDFs, there’s a vast collection of research out there that we
often forget to check: books. Don’t forget books. Someone may have passed this way
before — and left you a roadmap (aka endnotes).
Archives, too. Check those.
Be creative. Sometimes you can win an argument based on the spirit of the law rather
than its letter. (No, I’m not high. Sometimes you can.) Familiarize yourself with case law
and battles fought before. It’s easy to gaze upon a law like FERPA and surrender. But
there can be ways through.
There’s no more need to reinvent the records request than there is the wheel. Ask for
whatever documents have already been released.
Some government offices hoover documents. They’re that corner of the house where all
the dust collects. Learn your way around these places. Visit often. (One example of such
an agency: the state attorney general’s office.)
Instead of putting everything into one request, consider breaking your FOIA into parts.
Unbundling can speed things up. You can also ask to have records released in stages.
Ask for help, if needed. Your state might have a public access counselor (probably not,
but it might), or a bench-bar-press committee, or some other go-between.
