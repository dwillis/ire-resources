HOW TO USE THE GENERAL
RECORDS RETENTION SCHEDULE
Following the General Records Retention Schedule
The General Records Retention Schedule - 2004 supercedes and replaces the previously approved 1991
general schedule. It has been approved by the Colorado State Archives and the Colorado Attorney
General for City use effective November 4, 2004. The General Records Retention Schedule is intended
to be a tool to help the City departments manage their records. The purposes of a retention schedule
are: (1) to provide legal authority for the authorized destruction of obsolete City records; (2) to ensure that
City records are retained for the required period of time to meet legal and operational requirements; and
(3) to identify the departments responsible for retention of the “record copy” of specific records.
What if your department does not have some of the records listed on the General Records Retention
Schedule? Simply disregard the portions of the schedule that do not apply to you. You are not required
to start creating or retaining any records listed in the schedule if you do not currently create or retain
them. For example, if your office does not coordinate a board or commission, you will not have the
“record copy” of any of the board or commission records listed in Section 1.
Departmental Records Retention Schedules
The General Records Retention Schedule is not intended to cover specialized records retained by City
departments. Departments should determine if there are any specific legal and operational requirements
for such specialized records and should develop departmental records retention schedules to address
those specific records.
Any exception to the General Records Retention Schedule must be detailed in an approved departmental
records retention schedule, which should be developed in coordination with the City Clerk’s Office and the
Colorado State Archives.
Numbering System
The General Records Retention Schedule is divided into sections to facilitate updates and use. Records
series are identified with the section number and a sequential item number (example 11.90).
Record Titles and Description
Records are grouped logically to facilitate use. Descriptions of records have been included to facilitate
identification of records.
Retention of Record Copy and Duplicate Copies
The General Records Retention Schedule identifies the record copy custodian so that all users will know
where the record copy is retained. The name of the record copy custodian may be changed
administratively by the City Clerk’s Office without State Archives approval as organizational changes take
place.
Retention periods are based on legal requirements for those records governed by such legal
requirements and/or on common usage and industry standards for retention of City records to meet
typical administrative, operational or reference requirements.

ii

The retention time period indicates the minimum length of time that the record copy should be retained
by the City before disposal can take place. A retention period is always specified for the record copy and
may also be specified in some cases for duplicate copies for records that are widely distributed
throughout an organization. If no retention period is specified for duplicate copies of a particular type of
record, the City may dispose of these duplicates in accordance with the following guidelines:
DUPLICATE COPIES CREATED FOR ADMINISTRATIVE OR CONVENIENCE PURPOSES
Retain until no longer needed for reference and then destroy
DUPLICATE COPIES OF FREQUENTLY UPDATED DOCUMENTS
Retain until revised version is received, then destroy superceded version
DUPLICATE COPIES CREATED FOR PRESERVATION PURPOSES
Retain until preservation need ends
In most cases, duplicate copies should not be retained longer than the record copy.
Default Retention Period for Records Mandated by State Law
CRS 6-17-104 provides a default retention period of three years for records that state law requires to be
retained when no retention period is otherwise specified in the law.
Retention Schedule Applies Regardless of Storage Format
The retention period specified in these schedules applies to the information contained within the record
copy of the record, regardless of the physical format of the record (paper, microfilm, computer disk or
tape, optical disk, etc.).
Litigation Hold on Destruction of Records
Records that may be pertinent to any possible claim or litigation may not be destroyed even if the record
is eligible for destruction under the records retention schedule and even if the record should have been
previously destroyed and was not. Consult with the City Attorney’s Office if there is any question
regarding the destruction of records involving possible legal actions.

Important: No record should be destroyed if it is pertinent to
any anticipated, pending or ongoing litigation, claim or other
legal proceeding.
Non-Records
Guidelines for identification and handling of some non-records are discussed in Appendix A – NonRecords. There are no retention requirements for non-records, and non-records may be destroyed at will.
Retention Guidelines: Microfilming and Imaging
This retention schedule does not provide legal authority for the destruction of originals of records after
microfilming or imaging. If departments wish to microfilm and/or image records and then destroy the
originals, specific authorization for this action must be received from the Colorado State Archives.

Note regarding records of other agencies and entities: Records provided to the City for informational purposes by entities that are
not a part of the City government are in general not to be treated as City records for retention purposes. For example, the minutes
of the board of directors of an agency not appointed by the City would be a record of that entity and would need to be retained by
the City only until the information is no longer needed for City purposes.
