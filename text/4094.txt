Weathering the Storm
Using data to bolster the traditional weather story
Reporting on the weather is a fact of life in any newsroom, but not one typically paid much
attention outside of major disasters. But weather stories don’t have to suck. The National
Weather Service puts out more data in more formats than perhaps any government agency
outside of the Census. So please, hug a data set. Save a weather story today. It won’t cost
you a dime.

Know your gatekeepers
State climatologists will be able to tell you anything and everything that has happened in that
state, from record temperatures to historical averages. They can be invaluable sources of data
and many are more than willing to hand out whatever they have. Only 3 states currently don’t
have a state climate office (Georgia, Tennessee and Rhode Island). You can find contact info for
yours here:

In most cases, your local or regional National Weather Service office can help you with local
historical, current or forecast data and they provide it in a variety of constantly updating formats.
Don’t know your local office? Here’s a list by state:

Stuck on a term?
The National Weather Service offers a full glossary to help you decipher the scientific jargon
most meteorologists and climatologists are prone to. Find it here:

Plan ahead
The National Weather Service may be stupendous about putting out data in virtually every format
you could desire, but they’re terrible at organizing it. Poke around and figure out what data you
need for various situations on a sunny day, so you’re not scrambling for historical tornado data
when the roof blows off your building.

Context, context, context
The simplest and best thing data can do to a weather story is provide context. Field reporting is
great for color, but doesn’t always give you the big picture during a weather event. Data can
reinforce any weather story.
