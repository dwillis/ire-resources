Tackling sexual harassment
and misconduct

Launching an investigation
• Evaluate a story tip on deadline.
• Develop a plan of action.
• Start with easily accessible information.
• Focus.
• Count.
• Find the human stories.

Locating survivors of sexual crimes
• Documents
• News reports.
• Police reports.
• Criminal court records.
• Lawsuits.

• Find an intermediary.

To name, or not to name
• You can’t unring this bell. Make sure s/he
understands what using his or her name means.
• Pros
• Gives the public a measure of trust.
• Drives home the emotion of the situation.
• For some, it is a relief to share what happened.

• Cons:
• Very personal.
• Criticism.
• Social media trolls.

• Don’t force it.

The interview process
• Before you ask a single question:
• Overcommunicate. Explain what you’re doing, why
you want to talk and gauge comfort level.
• There’s a difference between what I believe and what
I can report.
• Explain why you have to ask detailed questions.
• What questions do you have for me?

• Let them guide the conversation.

• After the interview:
• Continue to communicate.
• Check details.

Breaking confidentiality barriers
Trauma is complicated. Confirm what you can.
• Child welfare documents
• Education records
• Medical records
• Mental health records
• Social service records
• When all else fails, ask
them for their own records.

Adapted fraud triangle
How is the process supposed to work?

How does it actually work?

Where could it/ does it
break down?

Handling pushback
USA Gymnastics
argued
that IndyStar was
attempting to
invade people's
privacy and go on
a "witch hunt."

Staying organized
• Use a file share program to manage and
organize large volumes of information.
• Build topical databases.
• Scan important paper documents
through an OCR program.
• Familiarize yourself with all information.

Fact checking
• Determine the standard that must be
met for publication. Consult with
editors and legal counsel.
• Ensure fact checking is at the end of
the process.
• Go line by line. Make sure the entire
team is involved. Challenge
assertions.
