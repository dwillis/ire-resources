Covering the Protest Line

Journalist Arrests - 2017

Physical Attacks - 2017
Nearly 70 percent of the physical
attacks on journalists last year (31
of the 45 cases) occurred during
protests.
Police officers were reportedly
responsible in 9 of those 31 cases.
The remaining 22 of 31 attacks
that occurred at protests were
reportedly perpetrated by private
individuals, including pro-Trump,
white nationalist, alt-right, and
anti-fascist protesters.

Before the Protest . . .
• Do your homework. Identify potential threats and prepare for them.
• Find a lawyer who will be available while you are reporting.
• Research the location of the protest and nearby police precincts.
• Research riot control tactics in the area and bring personal protective
equipment as appropriate. (Check with local police to make sure your
equipment is permitted, at least for journalists.)

• Plan for kettling.
• Team up with another reporter (if you can).

During the Protest . . .
• Bring a government-issued ID and cash.
• Wear press credentials and don’t blend in (BUT use judgment . . . ).
• Be aware of the situation/your surroundings; avoid breaking the law.
• If police issue a dispersal order or give any other directives, comply.
• If police stop you, explain that you’re a journalist covering the protest.

• If police ask to search your equipment, you do not have to consent.
(BUT . . .).

HOW TO COVER PROTESTS AND
OTHER ASSORTED MAYHEM

WHEN PROTESTS HAPPEN,
WHO’S INVOLVED?

PROTESTERS

On social media,
activists have their
own audiences – they
may not need the
media to get their
message out

TIPS
• Think of social media as a map
• Make a Twitter list of activists, officials and onthe-ground journalists
• Get access to closed Facebook groups
• When schisms happen, axe-grinders will
sometimes leak/publish private chat logs,
emails and texts that provide new insight

POLICE
• Police are just an extension of government;
they didn’t pass the laws they’re enforcing
• Police descriptions of protests (and of
protesters themselves) are often inaccurate
• Police chiefs often sound conciliatory; police
unions often throw gasoline on the fire
• Police sometimes break the law to bring order

RECORDS
• Get dispatch audio/911 calls, body camera
footage (where available), other internal
communications to get inside how police
responded to a protest
• After-action reports and DOJ investigations
will often critique the police response. Did
their use of force and arrests follow policy?
• Civil-rights lawsuits

GOVERNMENT
• Protesters often want officials to fix problems
that officials can’t or won’t fix
• Officials can feed paranoia by keeping
information to themselves
• What will the crisis cost taxpayers? (police
overtime; settlements for illegal policing;
expensive outside P.R. firms)

BUSINESS INTERESTS
• Protests affect local store owners and employees
• Companies are often pressured to take a side
• The structure of social-media platforms often
shapes (and warps) the conversation
– The “Tahrir bubble” – activists get large followings and
say dramatic things for retweets
– Large Facebook groups often prominently feature
hardliners’ posts if they draw a lot of reaction
– YouTube will spread conspiracy theories (sad!)

FINANCIERS
• Who pays for stuff?
– If activists self-finance, they often lack the
infrastructure for heavy-duty organizing
– If activists crowd-fund, sometimes they run into
backlash because they’re bad with money
– If activists join well financed political groups,
somebody gets disappointed eventually!
– If activists have a millionaire/billionaire backing
them, there’s always a story there

“My support has produced a much greater bang for the
buck than by the brothers Koch or Soros, Inc.”
-William H. Regnery II to BuzzFeed News

RECORDS
• Form 990s and state incorporation records can
help sketch out leadership structure
• State charity regulators will conduct
investigations if poorly run nonprofits break
the law
• Check terms of service for crowdfunding sites
to see how big a cut they take

THE “SILENT MAJORITY”
• For a reality check, go outside the protest
zone; talk to people who aren’t protesting
• Look for backlash: Protests will often prompt
opponents to take harder-line positions
• Protests’ biggest impacts are often on political
discourse
