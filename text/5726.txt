Do I really have to background EVERYONE?
-Even just a man on the street?
-Even if they are super nice?
-What if my mom knows her?

IF YOUR MOTHER SAYS SHE LOVES YOU...

CHECK IT
OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
(please don’t tell my mom)

Meet Dan Benedict!
-

Florida Times-Union,
Nov. 12, 2010

Former Green Beret and nurse
- Born-again Christian
- Leader of new nonprofit
devoted to rescuing exploited
girls from pimps and traffickers

… Sexual predator,
and white separatist
weapons stockpiler guy

Was this my fault?
You betcha!
I didn't have a system to check sources out.
I also didn't listen to my gut.

They had t-shirts!

They had eyeless
people doing some
kung fu stuff!

Was this my fault?
You betcha!
I didn't have a system to check sources out.
I also didn't listen to my gut.

What should my red flags have been?
- He literally said he had a hero complex
- Military background was likely
exaggerated
- Some people just feel like liars

What should my system look like?
Every person MUST BE CHECKED on a basic level,
-- but every person doesn't need every check
What aspects of this person’s background are relevant?
Keep a list of sites handy for your community
(tinyurl.com/IREbackgrounding)

Google the hell out of them
How many different ways?
As many as you can think of,
and go three pages in.

At least: whole name (In and out of quotes) and organization,
whole name (in and out of quotes) and city/state, last name and
organization, whole name in quotes and mugshot.

Check your organization’s archives
This should be your first stop
for all stories anyway.
Sometimes that guy at the council
meeting gives you the perfect quote
because he's been saying the same
thing to reporters for years.

Court records
Civil Courts:
Marriage, child support and divorce filings (not bad for
backgrounding potential dates either)
Debt collection attempts
Orders of protection requests (the type of court varies)
Criminal Courts – name, probably a DOB
Any criminal cases, traffic tickets
Assessors office:
Property records, unpaid taxes

Professional licenses
Does this person say she is a
doctor or a nurse? Make sure.
Same goes for any field that
requires a license.
Look for valid licenses AND any
disciplinary actions.

Facebook, Twitter, Instagram
FB: Search name, see ‘about’ page for jobs and relationships.
If friends are public, search for relevant first or last names.
Especially for politicians or potential candidates, check photos and
posts for red flags of racism, misogyny, inappropriate behavior.
Twitter archives from days before a person was high-profile

LinkedIn
Next level: Use previous jobs, titles, business names
• Sign up for LinkedIn For Journalists
• https://www.linkedin.com/groups/3753151
• Don’t forget to hide your profile before you go searching!

Nexis
Basic: Public records search
Can turn up hunting licenses, voter registration, cell phone numbers,
company names, former partners/spouses/roommates, email addresses
or even neighbors.

None of this should be treated as primary information.
No Nexis? Ask a friend.

PACER

Civil lawsuits, federal offenses, bankruptcies
If your organization doesn’t have it, ask a friend.
Walk down to the courthouse!

Get old school
Call someone who
would know.
Phone book, city guides,
church directories

What if nothing turns up?
Say it out loud.

What if something DOES turn up?

What if you do everything right and still
miss something?
It happens.
Own up to it and make it right.
If there’s a victim, honor that person - and save the next
reporter.

Make your own checklist!
