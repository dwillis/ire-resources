Six Stories about Algorithms
1. Discriminatory / unfair
2. Mistake that denies a service

3. Censorship boundaries
4. Breaks law or social norm

5. False prediction
6. Violation of privacy

What are consequences of algorithm to public,
or personal interest? Significance? Number of
people affected?

Let’s Brainstorm!
For example:

It would make headlines if an
algorithm that is used to rank
teachers led to a teacher getting fired.

Choose One Idea and Go Deeper
1. Is an algorithm really being used in that context?
If so, how?
2. What’s newsworthy? Why would outcome matter,
and to whom? What are consequences and
significance?
3. How would you investigate to see if that specific
algorithm was actually leading to that outcome?
What methodologies would you use to study it?
What data to gather and how to sample?

Be specific and write out the analysis step by step!
