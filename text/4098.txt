Start with a clean sheet
• What’s ‘mass’?
• FBI ‘at the same
time and place’
means what?
• 4 manslaughter
convictions =
mass killing?
• Mass shootings
≠ mass killings!

Doubting data and sources
• Start: FBI
Supplementary
Homicide
Reports
• Well-known
holes: FL, most
of IL

Doubting data and sources
• Less wellknown holes
• And
possible
holes?

What can you trust?
• And more
holes ...
• And false
reports ...
• FBI: 61%
accuracy

Doubting data and sources
• Challenge each
SHR case, ditch
phantoms
• Add obvious
missing cases
• Set commonsense definition,
add what fits
• ‘Keyboard’
database

Pay attention to process
• Process
becomes product
• Meet often – but
standing up
• Document
everything
• Let everyone
see everything

How do we tell this story?
• Post-narrative
projects
• Post-linear
projects
• Messy,
unwieldy, DIY
tools,
fragmented
products (web,
multiple mobile)

And just what is the story?
• What
catches the
ear of friends
& colleagues?
• What images
do we need?
• What jargon
needs
translating?

Deep dive: What might help you
• Doubt everything: data, definitions, sources
• Read the literature!
• Work backward from common sense
• Sweat the process
• Resist early story-framing
• Resist narrative imperative
