Winning over your boss
● Start small
● Volunteer for campaign finance stories
● Or school test scores
● Show-and-tell
● Training for others

Carving out time
● Assess your beat for stories that don't NEED to be done
● Create a time log to look for inefficiencies
● Keep a to-do list of items only related to your CAR story
● Have a couple CAR ideas in the pipeline to pluck away on
as you have time
● Keep a journal related to your story to make it easier to pick
up where you left off

Focusing stories
● Consider an "occasional" series: It can help get feedback
from readers and build better sources for more stories.
● Go deep rather than wide: MaryJo wrote about sick leave
payouts for public employees rather than every element of
pay.
● Be cautious about getting caught up in tangents during
reporting
● Check in with your editor frequently to keep focused

That little problem called "money"
● Open source software
○ QGIS - not as fancy as ArcView, but it works
○ Open Office - has most of the tools you'll need
○ MySQL - free database manager
● Free online tools
○ Google Docs, Fusion Tables, Refine
● Look for university professors
● Always ask for a waiver from fees when purchasing data
○ Study your state's open records law
○ How to request FOIA fee waivers
● Try to team up with another news organization

Tools for becoming more efficient
● Google comes in handy: Refine, Fusion Tables
○ Where Kids Live
○ Bridge Stuff
○ It geocodes addresses, too
○ Freedive uses Google Spreadsheets
● Pick a programming language and start studying/using it
○ Find something practical to get your feet wet
○ Pat uses Python to geocode addresses and scrape data
○ Regular Expressions (T2027--intro)
● Look for online tools to streamline your workflow
○ Evernote (It even has smartphone apps to help when
you are on the go!)

Prepared for breaking news
● Look for "explainer" story to do now
● Practice working with data you might need for things like
fatal car accidents, bridge collapses, flooding, bad weather,
etc.
● Get copies of local data that might be useful
● See IRE tipsheet 3477 -- "Ready when the story breaks"

Databases to have on hand
● Census
● Felony convictions
● Education data
● Public employee salaries
● Registered voters
● Property assessments
● Campaign finance (State and FEC)
● Check registries or warrant histories
● Risk management or claims data

Story ideas for any newsroom
● Public employee salaries
● Worst bridges
● Water infrastructure
● Charities
● Education
● Public contracts
● Safety violations
● Exodus or influx of people
● Claims against cities, counties, universities

MaryJo's examples:

Kevin's examples:

One data set, three stories
- Legal costs mount with software settlement
- Police are sorry they sued the city
- Outside counsel costs soar for city

Campaign Finance

Patrick's examples:

TOOLS:
QGIS
ShpEscape
Fusion Tables

Mapping lousy bridges

QGIS and Python
Python has a great library
called GeoPy that provides
access to several APIs to
geocode addresses.
Using QGIS, mapped all the
hires and grouped them into
voting districts. Unsurpising,
the mayor's neighborhood had
the highest concentration.
