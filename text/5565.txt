Building SOURCES
How to create long-lasting relationships, build
trust with victims and whistle blowers and
push hostile targets to talk to you.
@jbmckim

Building sources
• Everybody is a source – from Education
Secretary to student
• Think of your beat from different view points:
You want to know them all
• Get out of the newsroom
• Learn about the organization’s hierarchy.
Learn names, be personal
• Art of the interview: Prepare, know your
sources

Show up and learn
• Touch base from time to time so first call isn’t
in a crisis situation
• Go to meetings, show through your work and
presence that you care about a subject –
people will reach out to you.
• Be knowledgeable, educate yourself
• Art of the Interview: Great color, quotes from
being where people when they are active.

Be honest
• To gain trust, be trustworthy
• Tell sources what you are writing about and what to
expect
• Be clear about ground rules: Is this for background or
on the record?
• Be truthful about how a source will be portrayed
• When you can, let sources know when the story is
going to run
• Give hostile sources and whistle blowers similar
courtesy
• Art of the Interview: Silence is golden

When talking to reluctant sources
• Try to figure out why they are reluctant
• When do we give anonymity?
• Talk about motivationes to talk: They can
make a difference, protect someone else,
make responsible people accountable.
• They are not alone.
• Art of the interview: Empathize

Hostile sources
• Don’t assume their hostile
• If they are, tell them otherwise their side won’t
be heard
• Story will run/air anyway
• Give them multiple chances to talk
• Tell them your findings
• Art of the Interview: Ask not why did you kill the
baby, but others are wondering why you killed
the baby. What would you say to them?

Be persistent
• If a call doesn’t work, drop by
• If a visit is rejected, write an email and/or a
letter
• Ask a third person of trust to reach out for you
• If you are still rejected, give your source a last
chance before publishing.
• Art of the interview: Ask a question a
different way, explain why it’s important.
