Loevy & Loevy First Amendment, Media, and Transparency Practice
Top 5 Transparency Goals for the Year Ahead
1. Continue the fight against private email, private text messages,
and self-deleting forms of communication by public officials.
2. Establish First Amendment right of access to police shooting
videos on public streets in states with restrictive FOIA laws.
3. Sanction the FBI for its repeated bad faith and dishonesty in
FOIA responses and before the courts.
4. Establish the statutory requirement of “prompt” production of
records as 90 days except in rare and extreme circumstances.
5. Let no FOIA denial or untimely response go unchallenged in
court, regardless of ability to pay attorney fees.

And never forget, in the words of someone who knows: “When
information which properly belongs to the public is systematically
withheld by those in power, the people soon become ignorant of their
own affairs, distrustful of those who manage them, and eventually
incapable of determining their own destinies.”
