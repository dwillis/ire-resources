Theme 1

Escape from Google Maps

Google Maps is no longer free. New usage limits will charge users
who draw a lot of traffic. If you draw a lot of traffic, you
probably have to pay.

Four options
1. Stay below the limits
Stay under 25,000 hits/day, or only use for one-offs that spike and fade.

2. Pay Google
It will cost lots of money. Could be six figures.

3. Create a copycat
This is work. But new open-source tools make it easier.

4. Use HTML5 alternatives
Many maps don't need tiles. A simple HTML5 map is often superior.

A copycat needs three things...

a data source, like
OpenStreetMap

a tile set, like
you can make
with TileMill

a JavaScript
interface, like
Leaflet

OSM

Google

OSM

Google

An HTML5 alternative needs two things...

a way to convert data to
HTML5 formats

an HTML5 interface, like
Raphael

Theme 2
