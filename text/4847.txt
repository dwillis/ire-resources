#1 The Three Types of Interviews

ACCOUNTABILITY

at the wheel in the crash that killed her?

EMOTION

What you need to know
Why you should care

»Conﬂict
The guts of the story

»Conclusion

You get the answers you deserve
• Don’t blame the
interviewee
• Ask a stupid ques3on,
you get a stupid answer
So how can we ask smarter quesEons?

1. ASK OPEN-ENDED
NOT CLOSED QUESTIONS:
• ASK - WHAT, WHO?
HOW?
WHY?
WHEN?
• AVOID
YES/NO ANSWERS

2. DON'T GIVE PEOPLE
EASY ESCAPE ROUTES:

• AVOID THE DOUBLE-BARRELLED QUESTION
• THREE WAYS TO LET THEM OFF THE HOOK:
• DIRECT WAY OUT – TWO CHOICES
• UNNEEDED ADJECTIVE OR PHRASE
• UNNEEDED FACT

Obama escapes ques3on on Michelle…

• KROFT: Did you have to suppress the urge to tell
someone? Did you wanna tell somebody? Did
you wanna tell Michelle? Did you tell Michelle?

Why won’t Obama arm Syrian rebels?
We’ll never know with this queshon that gives him an
escape… by adding just seven unnecessary words at the end

3. BASIC IS BEAUTIFUL - KEEP IT
CLEAN AND SIMPLE
AVOID LOADED OR
CONTROVERSIAL
WORDS…
