COVERING A LOCAL PROSECUTOR’S OFFICE EFFECTIVELY DAY TO DAY
Thoughts shared at the national conference of Investigative Reporters & Editors.
Washington, D.C., June 7, 2003
By Steve Weinberg, book author, freelance magazine writer and occasional faculty
member at the University of Missouri Journalism School. Weinberg, based in Columbia,
Mo., has been collaborating with Brooke Williams and Neil Gordon at the Center for
Public Integrity, Washington, D.C., for three years on The Prosecutor Project. They are
in the home stretch of the project, which examines the performance of the nation’s 2341
local prosecutors’ offices.

First, a mea culpa and an explanation. The mea culpa: I started reporting
professionally in the late 1960s. Before I started freelancing for national magazines and
writing books, I covered beats for daily newspapers. One of those beats—the criminal
justice system, including prosecutors. At the time, I thought I was doing a pretty good
job of keeping up. Thanks to hindsight, I know today I was doing a terrible job. Like
most journalists, I saw prosecutors as “the good guys” trying to put the “bad guys” in
prison. My coverage was almost always uncritical, and sometimes downright worshipful.
The explanation: About 10 years ago, it finally dawned on me that prosecutors could
be covered differently, covered better, and I decided to do something about it. I finally
understood that the local prosecutor is the linchpin of the criminal justice system.
Corrupt or incompetent police officers? That is an important story, but the cases they
screw up cannot go forward in that screwed-up manner unless the prosecutor allows it to
happen. Corrupt or incompetent judges? A judge never sees a case unless a prosecutor
brings it to court. I began with an in-depth study of one murder prosecution that had
gone awry. I wanted to find out how something could go so wrong. I also wanted to find
out how labor-intensive it would be to dissect one case before I took on an entire office,
an entire system.
The local prosecutor is usually called the “district attorney,” but in some jurisdictions
other terms are used. The top person in the office is usually elected. Journalists should
be paying attention to the top person: What is her background? What campaign
promises did she make, and is she fulfilling those promises? Who has she hired for
investigative work, and why? For trial work, and why? Who has been fired or quit, and
why? How well does she work with police? With judges? With public defenders? With
private practice defense lawyers? With community leaders outside of law enforcement?
With average citizens? What is her policy about pre-trial plea agreements? Does she
instruct her lawyers to enter into them too readily? Or does she refuse to approve plea
agreements when they would be in the best interests of everyone involved—except
prosecutors hoping to win high-profile convictions for the sake of winning.
A lot of news organizations cover the local prosecutor’s office only superficially,
usually at election time and when there is a high-profile trial. Election time, however, is
normally just once every four years, and lots of incumbent prosecutors run unopposed.
As for high-profile trials, they are important, but not reflective of day-to-day
performance; in many jurisdictions, 95 percent of the crimes charged never go to trial.
Journalists should be exploring what happens to the cases constituting that 95 percent.
In a perfect world, journalists would track every arrest report from day one, asking
questions along the way such as these:

*Does the arrest as explained in the police report seem to make sense?
*Is the suspect available for a conversation, either in the local jail or in the community if
bonded out? Does the suspect’s version contradict the police version?
*How did the intake attorney in the prosecutor’s office rule on the arrest report? Did he
recommend prosecution? If so, on what charge? Or did he decide the case as presented
by the police is too weak to prosecute? If so, why?
*For the cases that are being prosecuted, what is the quality of representation for the
defendant? Is defense counsel adequately investigating discrepancies between the police
account and the defendant’s version? Has defense counsel noticed any obvious red flags,
such as the lack of physical evidence (fingerprints, blood, hair, semen, weapon, etc.)? If
forensic evidence is available, what is the reputation of the law enforcement employee
from the crime lab who ran the tests? It is now well-known that some crime lab
employees use flawed equipment, flawed techniques or shade the truth to help the
prosecution with convictions. What about a case that rests entirely on eyewitness
testimony, which is frequently unreliable? Is a police informant involved, either a paid
informant on the outside or a jailhouse snitch with a motive to lie in exchange for favors?
The best source is the paperwork that accumulates during the various stages of each
case. Talking to defense attorneys daily or weekly is vital, too. Attend their gatherings.
Tell them over and over that you want to hear about any case they want to discuss. Iron
out any policies that prevent untrammeled access to the prosecutor’s office. Then drop in
regularly to discuss specific cases and legal issues with the assistant district attorneys.
Talk to sources at the national professional associations to learn about contacts at the
local level. The prosecutors belong to the National District Attorneys Association in
Alexandria, Va. Visit the NDAA Web site regularly (www.ndaa.org). Subscribe to
NDAA publications. The defense lawyers belong to the National Association of
Criminal Defense Lawyers (www.nacdl.org).
The IRE Resource Center houses dozens of useful projects about prosecutors.
Frequently, those projects and books focus on one case gone awry. Those are valuable
up to a point. Newsroom projects and books examining prosecutors’ systemic successes
as well as shortcomings are rare. Perhaps the best ever are two 1999 series by the
Chicago Tribune, followed by dozens of stories through this year. The lead reporters are
Ken Armstrong (recently moved to the Seattle Times), Steve Mills and Maurice Possley.
Useful law review articles are numerous. Especially recommended is anything written by
Bennett Gershman, who teaches law at Pace University. One of the many I’ve found by
searching the Lexis database and university law libraries provides stunning insights into
the mind of a local prosecutor. It is by E. Michael McCann, the elected district attorney
in Milwaukee County, Wis. It can be found in the Spring 1996 issue of Marquette Law
Review. Although dozens of easily accessible books are valuable, I especially
recommend three for starters: “The D.A.: A True Story” by Lawrence Taylor (Morrow,
1996), “Mean Justice” by Edward Humes (Simon & Schuster, 1999) and “The
Prosecutors: A Year in the Life of a District Attorney’s Office” by Gary Delsohn (coming
in August 2003 from Dutton).
