Broadcast CAR: Quick Hits & Sweeps Packages
The Basic Rules
1. CAR should only be used as a tip or the beginning. It is rarely the story itself.

2. Be careful to compare apples to apples and not to oranges. To me, it's the same thing as lying and it's unfair.
3. It's often useful to explain the process and comparisons. It helps people understand this is special reporting.
4. Avoid using words like "database," "statistics," and "computer assisted." People don't get it and may tune out.
5. To avoid the glaze-over factor, come up with a creative way to visualize the numbers using something other
than a basic graphic.

6. Don't ever forget the golden rule - limit yourself to 3 numbers/statistics for the entire story.
