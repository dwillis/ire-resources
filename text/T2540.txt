Computer-Assisted Reporting

There are many reasons why computer-assisted reporting is a great skill.
CAR allows you to do unique stories that separate you from others in the
newsroom. CAR adds depth and detail to your stories. And there’s no doubt
that CAR will sharpen your math skills and make you a watchdog reporter.
How can I use CAR tools?
• CAR tools enable you to turn around stories quickly.
• For example, spreadsheets are a great tool to make basic calculations
such as adding, percentage change, ranking and subtracting. This is
useful when you are calculating lots of rows.
• Database managers, such as Access, help you analyze lots of data.
Examples of data you can use:
• School enrollment
• Test scores
• Budgets
• Salaries
• Election results
• Campaign contributions
Why should I learn CAR?
Because CAR tools will teach you to appreciate numbers like you never
have before. Numbers represent drama, struggle, conflict, and a story that is
crying for attention. And whether you love or hate numbers, the reality is
that stories filled with data make better stories. When you use data, the
possibilities are endless. Don’t be afraid to experiment with numbers. And
expect the unexpected.
