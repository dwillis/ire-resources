People-Finding
Tips & Traps:

When deciding what or how much information to enter for your search, it's best to start broad - with as
little information as possible. Two reasons for this:
§ If there's a mistake on either end - yours or the database's - an otherwise matching record will be
knocked out.
§ Even if the information you have is correct, the more you enter, the more you narrow your universe
of results. Say you have a subject's current address in addition to his name. By entering the address,
you've eliminated finding records of the subject's previous residences.
When searching phone records, remember that your subject might be listed in several different ways.
This is especially true with women. Note how your directory treats initials. Some allow the option to
find all names starting with the letter you enter. If you have no luck, consider using just the last name, or
search by the address only.
Once you've found your subject's address, search on the address alone, (without any name) if the
database has that option. You might find more records on your subject (due to alternative or misspelled
names), or others at the address.
Be aware of the possibility of misspellings or alternate spellings: Bryan might show up somewhere as
Brian; McDonald might be entered as MacDonald or Mc Donald. If you find one, search on it too.
Transposed numbers are common, esp. in public records.
If you have the choice, use a zip code, instead of the location name when limiting your search.
Location names can change but the zip normally does not. This is especially true when unincorporated
areas are annexed.
In most cases, the first three numbers of an individual’s Social Security Number are linked to the
individual's birth state. Knowing the state and its SSN range can help narrow the identification
possibilities in any of the public records services that provide a partial SSN. A listing of SSN state
allocations is found at http://www.usatrace.com/ssnchart.html.
Area codes: Sometimes the public records vendors will provide a phone number without the area code.
Here are two sites to help you find it: http://decoder.americom.com and
http://www.primeris.com/fonefind
Property records and state or county voter registration records can be searched in a variety of ways,
yielding other hints to build on, such as spouse or co-owner, relatives, or DOB.
Do not throw out old phone books, city directories, or CD ROM directories. They often provide
valid but unavailable information. Two examples: former neighbors and telephone numbers before they
became unlisted.
Know what the database contains. Read the fine print in the documentation to find out if the advertised
'CALIFORNIA CRIMINAL RECORDS' contains all, some or just a few counties. This is a problem
with public records especially. The completeness of an archive depends, in part, on the counties'
respective level of technology. Also note how often the database is updated and how current it is.

Many thanks to Marion Paynter, Library, The Charlotte Observer, for her contribution.
