On the Beat: strategies and mindsets for
accountability journalism

“Look back” to generate story ideas

▪ Major promises, programs
▪ Results of legislation
▪ Goals reached?
▪ Predictions

Looking back when you’re new on the beat

▪ Past budget documents lay out plans
▪ Major speeches by elected officials
▪ Past campaign ads and documents (Wayback Machine)
▪ Program audits
▪ News archives
▪ Grant proposals
▪ Hook for stories – anniversaries

Words Matter: fact check ‘em

Yes it’s cliché, but follow the money!

First steps: Read all the thick but incredibly revealing
documents no one else will.

▪ CAFR – Comprehensive Annual Financial Report
▪ Budget documents contain 100s of story ideas
▪ Bond prospectuses
▪ Rating agency reports

Budgets and Grants: the stuff they hope
you don’t figure out

▪ Agencies spend down funds on crazy stuff at year end
▪ Look for unspent grant monies
▪ Look back at “actual” spending by department and compare to
“budgeted” amounts.
▪ Watch budget transfers – taking from one agency to cover another’s
overruns

Payrolls and benefits

▪ Nepotism, cronyism in hiring
▪ Raises
▪ Labor contract negotiations
▪ Overtime
▪ Retirement benefits
▪ Travel expenses

Slackers

▪ Are elected officials showing up for work
▪ What are they doing at work
▪ Check their attendance at all the boards and commissions they brag
about membership on

Backgrounding key players

▪ Investigative profile stories
▪ Build files on the inner circle and their connections
▪ Look at what and who elected officials spend their campaign money
on.

Tips and Tricks
Story and Source Development
▪ Get the “Rulebook”
▪ Hit a few singles first
▪ Friends in “low” places
▪ Build trust; avoid cheap gotcha stories when can
▪ Follow the Silence
▪ Watch for rushed legislation
▪ Get to know the lobbyists on all sides

Bonus Tricks

▪ Make friends with your editor, but you don’t have to tell them
everything
▪ Follow your gut: Reporters tend to know a little about a lot of things.
What interests or amazes or angers you will likely strike readers the
same way.
▪ Specialize: Develop a niche based on your interests and hobbies.
Even a healthy obsession will do. It will give you confidence and
sharpen your eye for stories.
