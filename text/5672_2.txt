The opioid epidemic
Finding the humanity

1

The lesson
I learned from
Jessica

2

216 people died of a heroin-related
overdose in Palm Beach County in 2015.
Jessica’s brother Brian was one of them.

3

Brian had a knack for
numbers, a
mischievous twinkle in
his eye, and always,
the prettiest girl on his
arm.

4

Brian also had his demons.

5

Brian came to Palm Beach County to get clean.

So many compelling stories
… a drama of life and death.
And there are so many things our readers can relate to.

9

But there are
many things readers
may not relate to ...

10

11

Like all great journalism,

find the place that your reader sees himself, the feeling the reader
might feel, the moment he might picture himself in
… and then paint the picture around it.

The phone rings on the bus
Facebook and Instagram Canvas for emotional moments.
We found out Stephen Bono’s Dad
was on a bus - on the way home from
a D.C. rally about addiction when he
got the call that Stephen was dead.

First responders
Watching their peers overdose
and die.

And a new fear on the job - a whiff
of deadly fentanyl.

Hospital workers

‘We pull the sheet
over their faces.’
15

Jobs
Does your town have enough young workers to pass a drug test to
attract a new plant?
College applications
Kids who have gotten clean can’t get into college because they have
criminal records.
Sober dorms

Narcan: Who should
be equipped?
Police?
Librarians?
Schools?

Harm reduction – Is that promoting drug
use?
● Hepatitis C - $100,000 cure vs. a new
liver or death
● Medication based treatment
● Needle exchanges
● Repeated overdose revival

18

The bottom line …

People are dying.

Jessica is back in
Pawleys Island and
appears to be doing
well.

The idea
• A couple of years in the making – wanted to do something BIG
• Assignments tracked on a spreadsheet

• Saw “The Lost Boys” posts at 10 p.m. Monday
– Got mother’s approval for us to follow them...

• Where there were holes - time lapses etc - we went back a
second, third, fourth, etc time to check arrest reports, 911 calls
etc.

• AP style – what to call people?

The data
• Cast a wide net:
– The number of opioid related deaths
– The number of overdoses reported at area hospitals
– The hours spent by police and fire departments on overdose runs
– The number of people in the Hamilton County jail who were admitted
heroin users and how much that costs taxpayers
– The number of children in the NICU born to addicted mothers
– The number of child services cases opened that week with cases where
heroin was involved.

• Required checking in daily with nearly 40 sources.
• DEA National sources

Jails
• Data available
– https://www.denverpost.com/2017/09/30/pueblo-jail-overcrowdingstatewide-issue/

• Local jailers want to talk about issues
• To treat or not treat in jail?
– Recidivism

• 90-95 percent of inmates in our area jails drug related

• Overcrowding as public resources become scarce

Lessons Learned Covering
the Opioid Epidemic
Julia Lurie
Reporter, Mother Jones

Agenda
• Intergenerational effects of
addiction
• Pharma

Lessons learned
• Spend time with users!
• And spend time with their families—the effect of
addiction is intergenerational
• Relapse is really common
• Even with the best of treatment (e.g. roughly half of
those on buprenorphine or naltrexone relapsed in 6
months)

Source: SCOPE of Pain, Boston University

#impact (?)

Lessons learned
• Pharmaceutical influence is alive and well—and
out in the open
• Lots of pharmaceutical lawsuits  lots of
testimonies from former employees
