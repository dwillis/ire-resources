The Federal Freedom of
Information Act (FOIA)
• 5 U.S.C. § 552
• Provides a statutory right of access to
“records” in the possession, custody, or
control of federal executive branch
“agencies”
• An agency is not required to create new
records to respond to a FOIA request

FOIA v. State
Public Records Laws
• Every state and D.C. has adopted its
own public records law.
• State laws can vary significantly
(different procedures, exemptions,
etc.)
• The basic structure of state public
records laws & federal FOIA is the
same.

Pennsylvania’s Right to Know Law
(RTKL)
•

Unless otherwise provided by law, a public record, legislative
record, or financial record, shall be accessible for inspection
and/or duplication. 65 P.S. § 67.708; 65 P.S. § 67.102.

•

A public record is broadly defined as information, regardless
of physical form or characteristics, that documents a
transaction or activity of an agency and that is created,
received, or retained pursuant to law or in connection with a
transaction, business or activity of the agency. It includes a
document, paper, letter, map, book, tape, photograph, film
or sound recording, information stored or maintained
electronically and a data processed or image processed
document. 65 P.S. § 67.102

FOIA. What is it good for?
•
•

Unless
A public

Before you start drafting that
request . . . .
•

Familiarize yourself with the law.

•

Think about your goals and alternative routes to obtaining
the information you want (RTKL v. federal FOIA?)

•

Do a little research.

•

Has someone else requested these records before?

•

Which agency (or agencies) has the information you
want?

•

How is it maintained; where is it stored?

Getting Started
• The basic process of filing a
FOIA request is easy. There
are three requirements:
– (1) Written request
– (2) “Reasonably describe” the
records sought
– (3) Follow agency regulations

• Look at the agency
regulations/website.
• How do you know where the
agency regs/website are?

Drafting Your Request
•

Your request must be specific enough so that a government
employee familiar with the subject area can locate the
records with reasonable effort.

•

Consider:

•
•
•

The tradeoff between the scope of records you are
seeking and the time it will take to get a response.
Keywords, dates, individuals, and locations/offices can
all be limiting factors.

After you write your request, try reading it from the
perspective of the records officer.

Two Kinds of Requests . . .
•

The Targeted Request
•
•

•

Asks for something specific that you already know exists.
Provide details you have (the date, title of the document,
author, office that generated it, etc.)
BUT think about how you know the record exists . . .

Two Kinds of Requests . . .
•

The Exploratory Request
•
•
•

Asks for records in the hopes of finding something
interesting.
*You must still satisfy the specificity requirements of the
relevant law.
Consider keyword searches with relevant time frames:
• For example, a request for all records that mention
or reference “Nelson Mandela” since January 1,
2017.

Examples
•

The Targeted Request
•

•

“The April 13, 1958 memo from J. Edgar Hoover to the
Deputy Attorney General titled [x].”

The Exploratory Request
•

“All emails from Kirstjen Nielsen to email addresses
ending *.com that were sent between June 1, 2017 and
July 30, 2017.

•

“All text messages sent or received by Steve Mnuchin
that contain the word “eclipse.”

Records Systems
•

Sometimes it can be helpful to include information about
agency records systems (where records are stored) in your
request.
•
•

•

For RTKL requests, consider researching records
retention schedules from state archives, the Secretary of
State.
For federal FOIA requests, check out
www.foiamapper.com and foia.wiki

The FBI’s Central Records System (CRS)

Records Formats
•

Specify the format that
you want the records
released (e.g.,
electronic records).

•

FOIA requires agencies
to “provide the record
in any form or format
requested . . . if the
record is readily
reproducible by the
agency in that form or
format.” 5 U.S.C. §
552(a)(3)(B).

Expedited Processing
•

FOIA permits agencies to use multitrack processing.

Expedited Processing
•

“[W]ith respect to a request made by a person primarily engaged in
disseminating information, urgency to inform the public
concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.”

•

If you do request expedited processing, you must include a
statement that the reasons for expedited processing are certified to
be true and correct to the best your knowledge and belief.

•

Not many requests for expedited processing are granted, but most
are denied in a short period of time.

Fees (FOIA)
•

Agencies may charge “reasonable” fees for the “direct” costs
of searching for and copying the records you request, unless
you are entitled to a fee benefit or a fee waiver.

•

If you are a representative of the news media, and the
records are not sought for commercial use, fees are limited to
cost of duplication.
• You also get first 100 pages free, then ~$0.05 $0.15/page after that, or the actual direct cost of the copy
(e.g., if in electronic form).
• Be sure you identify yourself as a representative of the
news media!

Fee Waivers (FOIA)
•

Agency must grant fee waiver “if disclosure of the
information is in the public interest because it is

likely to contribute significantly
to public understanding
of the operations or activities of the government
and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.”
•

Your FOIA request has to state why you are entitled to a fee
waiver.

Fees (RTKL)
•

Except as otherwise provided by statute, no other fees may
be imposed unless the agency necessarily incurs costs for
complying with the request, and such fees must be
reasonable. No fee may be imposed for an agency’s review of
a record to determine whether the record is a public record,
legislative record or financial record subject to access in
accordance with this act. 65 P.S. § 67.1307.

•

Duplication fees must be reasonable and based on prevailing
fees for comparable duplication services provided by local
business entities. Fees for local agencies may reflect regional
price differences.

Fee Waivers (RTKL)
•

•

An agency may waive the fees for duplication of a record,
including, but not limited to, when:
•

the requester duplicates the record; or

•

the agency deems it is in the public interest to do so.
65 P.S. § 67.1307.

Again, remember to ask for a fee waiver in your request!

Submitting Your Request
•

FOIA: Check the agency website and regulations (foia.wiki)
• Some agencies accept via email/electronic portal, some
by fax, some by snail mail.
• If mailing/faxing CLEARLY mark it as a FOIA request.

•

RTKL: Send your request to the Agency Open Records
Officer (check the agency’s website or the OOR database:
https://www.openrecords.pa.gov/RTKL/AOROSearch.cfm
• Some agencies have their own RTKL request forms; the
Office of Open Records has a standard form.
• You can submit via email, fax, U.S. Mail or in person.
KEEP TRACK OF ALL YOUR DOCUMENTS AND
CORRESPONDENCE!

Now What?
•

FOIA requires agencies to make a “determination” within 20
days following receipt of a request.
5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A). This deadline may be extended in
“unusual circumstances” by no more than ten working days.
5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(B)(i).

•

Under the RTKL an agency has 5 business days to respond in
writing to: (1) grant the request; (2) deny the request, citing
the legal basis for the denial or partial denial; or (3) invoke a
30-calendar day extension for certain reasons (e.g., off-site
location of records, staffing limitations, need for legal review
or redaction, complex request).

. . . Disappointment
•

Unfortunately, statutory deadlines are not always complied
with. For federal FOIA requests, they are rarely met.

•

Redactions and withholdings are increasingly common.

Addressing Delay
•

Follow up!
•

Ask for an estimated date of completion.

•

Consider negotiating/limiting the request.

•

Be persistent (but polite).

•

And, again, keep track of all of your correspondence and
contacts. (You will need everything related to your
request for any administrative appeal).

Administrative Appeals (FOIA)
•

What can you appeal?
• Failure to respond to a statutory deadline
• Sufficiency of the agency’s search
• Exemptions & segregability
• Lack of “foreseeable harm”

•

If the agency issued a determination on your FOIA request
you MUST appeal if you want to file a lawsuit.

•

You don’t need a lawyer – you can do administrative appeals
on your own!
• But consider running them by your editor, in-house
counsel.

Administrative Appeals (FOIA)
•

The time period to appeal will vary by agency (check the
agency’s regs) but will be “not less than 90 days after
the date of such adverse determination.”

•

FOIA requires an agency to make a determination with
respect to any appeal within 20 working days after its
receipt. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A)(ii).
•

The average processing time for the agencies that
processed the most appeals in FY 2017 was 26.08
days (DHS), 47.95 days (DOJ), and 177.21 days
(DOD).

Administrative Appeals (RTKL)
•

Appeal in writing to the Office of Open Records (or use the OOR’s
Appeal Form) within 15 business days of the mailing date of the
agency’s response to your request.

•

Appeal must explain why the record is a public record and address
all grounds asserted by the agency for denying the request.

•

The OOR has 30 days from the date of its receipt of the appeal to
issue a final determination.

•

When the OOR issues a Final Determination it is binding on the
agency and the requester. If either the agency or the requester
wants to appeal the ruling, the appeal must be filed with the
appropriate court within 30 calendar days of the mailing of the
Final Determination by the Office.
