• How much damage to our roads?
• What’s the cost and who pays for it?
• How do you catch them?

The first place to start to find out if overweight trucks are rolling through your state unchecked is your
own department of transportation, the state public safety department, the state highway patrol and/or
division of motor vehicles.
Find out when your legislature increases truck weight limits. It often means that your state highway
department will have to post more bridges, and many of them are likely not to do that. It’s politically
unpopular and it doesn’t attract very much attention.
Find out if your state has been weighing trucks for years as part of a pavement study coordinated by the
Federal Highway Administration. The North Carolina data was hugely helpful. It gave us a good idea of
the percentage of trucks that are overweight. You can’t get that number from weigh station data, because
overweight trucks detour around the scales. You can’t get it from portable scale data, because weight
officers weigh selectively, not randomly – mostly they weigh trucks with fat tires.
At the federal level check out the Vehicle Travel Information System, Federal Highway Administration.
Vehicle Weight data is collected at the state level periodically throughout the year using weigh-in
motion devices. The information is used by FHWA to evaluate changes in truck travel in order to assess
impacts on the highway safety; the role of travel in economic productivity; impacts of changes in truck
travel on infrastructure condition, and maintaining our mobility while protecting the human and natural
environment.
Data has been collected for 25-40 states from 1990-2005 – not every state is included in each year.
