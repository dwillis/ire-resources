- What is accountability journalism?
o Not just an ambush interview

o Not a simple explainer
o Not one and done
o We are advocates for the public interest, true watchdogs:
 “Accountability journalism encompasses all journalistic efforts
that strive to hold powerful people accountable for what they
say, what they do, and what they should be doing.” (Jane
Elizabeth, American Press Institute, Sept. 2017)
- Where do we find accountability stories?
o Open-source data, public records, etc.
o Human sources, inside information, whistleblower
o Audits, internal reviews (old & new)
o Follow-up to breaking or daily news coverage
o Viewer tips
 Solicit tips on website & after stories
 Tell people the types of stories you’re looking for
 Be accessible: list your email and phone number on social
media
 Prove to people that you respond (Ex: ‘This story came from a
tip...’)
- Where do I start?
o Learn everything you can about an issue/policy/topic
o Be efficient. Think strategy.
o Find the emotion (i.e. victim, public outrage, etc.)
- THE INTERVIEW….
o If they say NO?
 After your story airs/posted online- keep pushing for an
interview.
 Create a graphic: “Here are the questions we have…”
 Give me real numbers. “I emailed 12 times and called eight
times, over past three weeks…”
 Literally, show me what you did to get answers…
 Example:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh_yf4PjC4A&t=57s
o A few things to remember.
 Be patient. Go slow.
 Don’t give up…

- Before the interview – some things to consider
o First question is do you need the interview?
 Think about who the story impacts and the position of the
subject.
• Mayor? Yes, probably
• Shoe salesman, maybe not
• No need to be sensational
 Example
o Be transparent
 We don’t send questions, but we do send topics
 Send them what you have, no need surprises
• If you know your information is solid, then this doesn’t
ruin your story, it only gives them an opportunity to dig
themselves a deeper hole.
 They may decline after seeing what you’d like to discuss, that’s
a story too
o Prepare and practice
 Sit with your sources to better understand the subject
 What might they say? How might they respond? How will they
treat you?
 Run through scenarios – practice how you’ll open and close the
interview
 Don’t be a jerk!
- So, it’s time for the interview...
o Choose a public setting and if it’s not public then make sure it’s okay
for you to be there
 Know who else might be around and consider that impact on
your piece

 If they say leave, you go immediately
 Example: maintenance supervisor
o Scheduled Interview:
 If you’re with a photographer, send them ahead to set up
• “finishing up some calls” or “need to use the restroom”
 Make sure your notes are organized and clear – don't waste
time you might only have one chance accountability
interviews are rarely long
 Ask follow up questions don’t move on until your question has
been clearly answered
o Unscheduled interview:
 Always begin with an introduction, possibly hand your card
over
 Make sure you’re asking your question quickly, clearly, and
directly
 Understand the layout/landscape of the area
 Know when it’s time to wrap it up/let it go
• You've shown your audience the person is not going to
answer questions but you’ve made every effort.

Accountability when access not possible
•
•
•
•

Look for lawsuits against the agency or person you’re investigating and talk to the
attorneys who filed them.
Did they get insider documents or video through discovery?
Were depositions done?
Were they recorded? Yes! (goldmine)

Accountability for access to public records
• Hold agencies accountable to follow public records laws.
• Always, always, always insist they cite chapter & verse for records denials.
• Always read the law they cite to make sure it applies. It often doesn’t. That provides
grounds for an appeal, lawsuit, or simply pointing out the illegal lack of transparency in
your report.
Tips for doing unscheduled accountability interviews:

•
•
•
•
•

Give them warning that you’ll be approaching them in public. No surprise ambushes.
Be polite and professional.
Have your top three questions ready to rock as that’s the most you’ll likely get.
Build to accountability moment when you write story, so viewers are as frustrated as
you are.
Punch up. Not down. (Be thoughtful about who you are holding accountable. Those in
power – yes. Those already marginalized – no.)
