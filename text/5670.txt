History of NICAR
◼ 1989: The Missouri School of Journalism established the
Missouri Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting (MICAR)
◼ 1993: Investigative Reporters and Editors, also based at the
school, took over operations of MICAR. It was renamed the
National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting. First
NICAR conference is held in Raleigh.

A Buzzfeed News investigation found that the FBI and
Homeland Security use planes equipped with cameras,
"augmented reality" and cell phone trackers in order to monitor
U.S. cities from the air.
It also found that planes tended to focus on neighborhoods
with higher Muslim concentrations, especially neighborhood
mosques and other areas that have a majority Muslim
concentration.
Surveillance also signiﬁcantly drops on weekends.
