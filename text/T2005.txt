EDUCATION STATISTICS TIP SHEET
1. Chi-Squares
* How many black children passed the state’s 8th-grade test? How many
would be expected to pass if racial differences were not evident? A Chi-Square
answers such a question by testing numbers in separate categories with the expected
number if there were no variation.
* Created with a Contingency Table, as seen below. Cross multiply by the
totals in each row & column, then divide by the total. If 20 percent of the children
statewide failed the test, then the Chi-Square will fill in the total for 20 percent in
each category.
* Some variation is always expected, so how much variation is statistically
significant? That must be determined by using the Chi-Square statistic. Consult a
statistics textbook. Suggested reading: Chapter 15 of Statistical Techniques in
Business & Economics, Lind Marchal Mason, 2001 and Phil Meyer’s Precision
Journalism.

Example: (13,188 x 15,388)/ 86,565 = 2,344
2. Pearson Correlation Coefficient
* Designed to indicate how closely one column of data is related to another
column. For example: Is there a relationship between the amount of money spent
per student and SAT scores? Used only with two columns of data.
* The closer the Pearson score is to 1 or –1, the closer the correlation. Very,
very rarely is there a perfect correlation. There is a moderately strong correlation at
.5 or -.5. A correlation of .75 or -.75 are strong correlations.
* If there is a strong correlation, we can conclude there is a relationship
between two variables. We cannot say for certain that a change in one causes a
change in another.
* Excel formula is: =PEARSON(Array 1, Array 2)

3. Regression
* Designed to tell us the linear relationship between two variables. Designed
to tell us what proportion of the variation in the dependent variable can be
explained by, or accounted for, by variation in the independent variable. (Statistical
Techniques in Business & Economics; Lind, Marchal, Mason; 2001)
* Results best seen in a scatterplot, preferably in SPSS. Scatterplot identifies
outliers.
* R-Squared statistic (Coefficient of Determination) gives of the percentage
of change in Y that can be attributed to changes in X. For instance, an R-squared of
.58 means that 58% of the changes in a school’s mean test scores can be attributed
to the percentage of poor students in the schools. R-Squared is the Pearson
Correlation Coefficient squared.
