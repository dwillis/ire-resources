Recycle your data, viz
and code
Maximize the value of your work by doing things that
can be used again and again with quick updates.
THE FULL JOURNO NERD SPECTRUM IS WELCOME HERE.
These strategies work for: “lonely coders,” reporters just learning Excel,
programmers and data wranglers.

How this will work (we hope)

We’ll introduce ourselves
Then share a few examples of things we’ve recycled (or seen others recycle).
We’ll talk about how to identify these opportunities
And explain to editors why it’s worth your time.
We’ll spend most of the session in open discussion, brainstorming ideas that
we’ll add to a Google spreadsheet.
Or, at your suggestion, we’ll abandon this plan and do whatever is most
useful for you.

Identifying opportunities
●
●
●
●
●

What stories or products do I create every year or every quarter? Or topics
you repeatedly explore?
What kinds of information do I need for those stories?
What are ways I use (or could use) that info in presentation or reporting again
and again?
How often will it need to be updated to be relevant to work?
Can I save myself time in the long run by gathering/building/coding it now?

Making it happen
●

Write a memo to yourself (and your boss?) about what you hope to achieve,
how the investment now will save time later and improve your stories.
○

●

Document your process — even if it’s just a Word doc of notes.
○

●
●

If you can’t make a strong argument to yourself for your own time, it might not be as worth
your work as you thought.
Source of info and experts who know it.
Quirks in what it means or how it’s released.
Your steps for cleaning and building it.
Reporting observations and questions. Ask the same ones year after year or flag potential
folos for later.

Set a calendar reminder for yourself to update or use it again.
Share it with your team to make even more of your work.

or learning goals

Other code ideas?
- Salary database into charts, super
repeatable
- Simple “games” to explain any issue you
often find yourself re-explaining

Brainstorming!
Let’s break into small groups to toss around ideas.
We’ll regroup and share in a bit.
