Other Tips
✤

Spacing may vary, but easting and northing must be same length

✤

Reports will routinely omit the Grid Zone Designator in the body of
text (may be included in header metadata)

✤

Not all grid zones or 100km squares are actually squares

✤

Typos in report may geocode some coordinates to Antarctica

✤

I am not a map nerd. Someone else can tell how to use in ArcGIS.
