GET IT TOGETHER

☻Separate personal and work life, but
remain available w/laptop, smart phone
☻Lists!
☻Set personal deadlines
☻Export work, notes, reminders from
phone
☻Filter, folder, tag in email
☻Team code words "front burner"
"priority one" "red team"
☻Karina Ramirez, Spanish publication
Al Dia, completely declutters and
cleans her desk every.single.day, so
she can start every day fresh
☻Brandon Formby, business, creates
immaculate beat notes and budget lines
to help him focus and make his thought
process clear to his editor
☻Know your function, stay in your lane
☻Try new techniques, adopt what works
☻Color code
☻Keywords, naming conventions across
all files, drives
☻OCR PDFs for searchability
☻Backup across multiple drives
☻Sort so apples to oranges at least
become fujis to honey crisps
☻Find patterns in record data
☻Plan, but be flexible, and accept that
