Why data?

More and more, records are
kept electronically.
We can use them to…

 Uncover basic information.
 Test government officials, procedures,

regulations and promises.
 Enterprise reporting – do stories that no one

else is doing.
 Interactive graphics and services.

 Typically, the data or your desired end goal

will determine what tool you’ll use.
 If in doubt, start with spreadsheets then

move from there.

Test Policy

 Why are you here? What do you need to

accomplish?
 Go to the sessions that will get you where you

need to be.
 Network with those that can help you.

 Three different kinds of session at this

conference: Panels, demos and hands-on
 At each time slot, there are sessions available

for all experience levels.
 Mini boot camp & Build your first news app

vs. other hands-on classes.

Start Small, Stack Skills
 Start with Excel, keep learning from there
 Don’t try to know every program – nobody

can do this so don’t be intimidated.
 Use what ever programs work for you best.
 CAR work covers more than giant
investigations, just get started and keep
learning. Try Access or SQL.
 Schedule time for CAR the week you return
home — you can’t learn if you don’t do.

1. Act NOW:




don´t wait for everyone´s approval, be a first
mover and show others what can be done.

2. Focus on DATA:






everyone can understand data
Data is your raw material
make it reusable by others and by visualization
tools, share

Building our own DATA Repository
 181.000 - Wikileaks cables
 25,000- docs leaked in corruption case
 38.000 - National and 12 states, Official Bulletins
 4.500 - National Government Direct purchases

orders since 2008
 250.000 records of Monthly payments from the
Transportation Department to Bus Companies
 1.500.000 – Records of local fuel sales transactions
since 2003
 30.000 - Purchase Orders of two counties

3. Develop SKILLS
 Excel for databases + Stats
 Tableau Public
 other: Fusion Tables, Arcview (maps) and

Qlikview (database and BI).
 learn to speak the “Tools” language including

those you will never learn but should know
what can do – start with NICAR´s program!

4. Gather a data TEAM:
 and promote teamwork : internal and

external
 Internal: Journalists with programmers, designers.

Online with print news teams
 also… take the elevator to other departments
Business Intelligence and IT may be your new best
friends!
 External: NGOs, scientific and academic by topics
and expert readers or users

5. GET INVOLVED!
 Get involved and contribute: hackathons,

user groups, twitter lists, open data
movements.
 Detect experts to learn from, follow them

and help whenever we can.

6. PRODUCE big and small
 Quick little projects or impactful results, from

a unique data visualization (Tableau, Many
Eyes) or opening a dataset (Junar )
 To big projects as Wikileaks , detecting

corruption from a dataset or creating a
news app with data, everything counts so
everyone gets results.

 Go to the overview sessions to get a sense of

what’s possible.
 Go to the bar and strike up a conversation – just
remember that we don’t all have great social
skills.
 Go to hands on sessions for things you want to
learn – get there early and talk with the teacher
about ideas
 If you want to know more about what someone
talked about – make a date to see more of it.

 If you’re on the Web development side – go to

some more traditional CAR classes or
sessions
 If you spend most of your time digging
through data – go to some of the sessions on
interactive
 Find folks you can ask questions of AFTER the
conference.

 Some conversations you have will be over

your head. Don’t be discouraged: Focus on
the ones that apply to what you do.
 Go to the breaking news and “ideas” sessions
to get tangible ideas you can work on right
away.

 Start small.
 Think of CAR like a foreign language – you

have to practice and practice often.
 Get your editor/producer excited about what
you’re doing. If they don’t “get” CAR, teach
them.
 Teach someone else.
 Working on a story? Find similar ones done
elsewhere to help you get going on the
analysis and questions.

 If you’re struggling with something, reach out

for help. The NICAR list (archives) is great. Also
feel free to contact IRE at datalib@ire.org.
 Put crib notes up next to your desk to help you
remember things.
 Unless you want to be a news app developer,
remember that it’s about data analysis and
those skills.
 Don’t downplay the value and power of a
spreadsheet.

 Don’t forget to use IRE’s tipsheets and story

database.
 Check out the practice data sets on IRE’s site.
