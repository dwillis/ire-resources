“Tale of two ports: LA cargo volumes up in 2016, Long
Beach down”
– Daily Breeze
The fallout from Hanjin was
pronounced in December. Last
month, cargo imported into the
Los Angeles port climbed 22.6
percent compared to the same
time last year. Long Beach
experienced an 8.2 percent
drop.
Overall, container volume rose
10 percent across the United
States in December, according
to a report by Panjiva Research,
a global trade data firm. Driven
by a 32 percent rise in imports
from China and Hong Kong, the
Los Angeles port saw the
biggest jump in cargo.

“What’s at stake for U.S. in a trade war with China”
– CNN Money
Tensions are already high
between the U.S. and China
when it comes to trade.
The immediate concern is
that a trade war -- where
both countries hit each other
with tariffs -- would erupt
between the world's
two biggest trade partners.
Major U.S. industries, and
lots of jobs, could get caught
in the crossfire.
The U.S. exported $125.3
billion in goods to China in
the 12 months ending in
November, according to
Panjiva, a firm that tracks
global trade data. Top of the
export list: airplanes,
soybeans and cars.

“For the Trumps, ‘Made in U.S.A.’ May Be a Tricky Label to
Stitch”
– The New York Times
Factored into those prices is the cost of
materials and production, as well as shipping,
tariffs, marketing and advertising expenses.
Cheap production overseas means more coin in
the coffers of Ms. Trump and the shoe,
accessory and clothing makers that are her
partners, among them Marc Fisher footwear,
the G-III Apparel Group and Mondani. (Ms.
Trump’s company, which is privately held, does
not disclose its financials.)
Almost all of her goods are made overseas,
according to a New York Times review of
shipments compiled separately by Panjiva
and ImportGenius, two trade databases.
ImportGenius tallied 193 shipments for
imported goods associated with Ms. Trump for
the year through Dec. 5, mostly Chinese-made
shoes and handbags. Her dresses and blouses
are made in China, Indonesia and Vietnam,
according to a review of hundreds of clothing
tags and financial documents filed by G-III.
