Louisiana Public Records Law 2012
This table provides a side-by-side review of the text of the Public Records Law found in
Louisiana’s Revised Statutes and what that text actually means in plain English. The
comparison was prepared by The Public Law Center at Tulane University Law School and
is available here as part of PAR’s work with the New Orleans Coalition on Open
Governance (NOCOG) and through grants from the Open Society Foundation and the
Greater New Orleans Foundation. The side-by-side was a current statement of the law
when posted to PAR’s website but has not been updated to incorporate new legislation
passed or judicial decisions rendered since 2012. These copyrighted materials are used

requested record.

public holidays, for the exercise of the right
granted by this Chapter.

records are in active use by the auditor.

must also answer
questions that will help the
requestor locate and
review the record.

his custody or control, its location, what
person then has custody of the record and

discretion award him reasonable attorney's fees
or an appropriate portion thereof.
