In-house user testing process (good for daily projects)
●
●

●

●

Find someone not directly working on editorial projects — finance, HR, communications,
etc. — and show them the project you want to test
Conduct a quick interview
○ Don’t tell them what it is, but get their impressions of what it is. The more they
talk the better
○ Tell them that there are no right or wrong answers
○ Remain objective and try to understand why they think and do certain things, and
what would make it a better experience
Implement feedback
○ After just 2 or 3 people, similar points of feedback will probably emerge, pointing
out what works and what doesn’t work
○ Make changes to address the problems
Test again to make sure the changes worked

User testing process for longer-term projects
●
●
●

●
●
●

Decide which project we want to test
○ Especially which part of which project
Write an interview guide and a short script with boilerplate questions
○ See a sample interview guide ​below
Recruit users
○ Social media can be helpful
○ Might also reach out to newsletter email lists, check an existing database of your
readers/listeners, etc.
○ Recruit people who are not journalists or designers
Schedule 3-6 session for a given morning or afternoon
Set up a screen-sharing session in join.me (or the app of your choice)
Conduct the interview
○ Icebreaker: chat with the participant to get them comfortable
○ Brief description of the project and goals
■ “It’s important to note there are no right or wrong answers.”
■ “Everything you tell us helps us make the this better.”

Main interview:
■ Use open-ended questions
■ Good first question: “Can you tell me what your first impressions are?
What are you seeing here?”
■ Encourage the participant to explore on their own
○ Wind down:
■ “Great. What did you think of the information you saw?”
■ “That’s it for my questions. Before we wrap up, is there anything else
you’d like to tell me about what we looked at?”
Debrief as a group and decide what changes to make to address users’ feedback
Retest the project if you can to check if the changes were effective

Example of an interview guide (from an election project)
Warm-up script
“Welcome. Thanks for coming in today. I’m a researcher and it’s my job to learn about you and
observe how and why people use online tools. This is not a standard test, so there are no right
or wrong answers or actions. Please speak openly and honestly throughout the session, and
just imagine you’re putting your brain on speakerphone.”
Ask permission to record.
Before we start
● What are the top websites you visit the most?
● What do you know about WNYC?
● Have you ever visited their website?
● How often do you visit?
● For what reason? (Podcasts, streaming, on air (live), donation, etc.)
● Do you consider yourself an informed voter?
Show the prototype
Imagine Election Day is coming up in a few days and you’re going to vote. You see this link to
an election guide on your social media feed, you click and see this.
● “What are you seeing?”
● “What would you do next?”
Ask follow-up questions
On a scale from 1 to 10, how likely are you to use this? Why?
● What do you like best about this experience?
● What do you like least about this experience? Was there anything confusing?
● What information would you want to know about voting in elections?
● Did you think there was information missing from this guide?
● What would be your next step after using this guide?
