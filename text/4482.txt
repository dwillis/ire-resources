Tips for filing a military FOIA: Know who the record keepers are.
-If you send a request to the general Army FOIA, PREPARE TO WAIT MONTHS—EVEN MORE
THAN A YEAR!
-Find out what specific office is the keeper of the records. It will save you time.
-Don’t let FOIA officer scare you away from your request. Feel them out see if there are ways
to narrow your request vs. letting them dictate to you what THEY want to give you.
Military Service Records
This is probably one of the first places we go to background a soldier’s story. When you’re covering big
stories this is a great place to check their service record and honors received.
HOW/WHERE TO MAKE REQUEST:
Army: HRC, (502) 613-4213
Navy: CHINFO (703) 697-5342
Air Force: (703) 695-0640 (good place to start they’ll help get you to right place)
(210) 565-2334 (if active duty or reservist currently)
(314) 801-0800 (If member separated before 2005 national archives in St. Louis)
Marines: (703) 614 4309
What they’ll need: Full name, DOB, if you have info on last known location/service. Sometimes they
will ask you why you want the information so be prepared to give a brief description of your report or
that you’re trying to confirm what they’ve told you. (Army usually responds within day or faster)
Military Pay Records
-DFAS: Defense Finance and Accounting Service foia@dfas.mil
-We requested gross pay received by Nidal Hasan from 2009-April 2013 and discovered he had
collected more than $278,000 while he sat in jail awaiting trial and victims were struggling.
Under the Military Code of Justice, a salary cannot be suspended until they are proven guilty.
-Request took about two months
County Records
(Remember, not all records have to directly from the military)
-Bell County Jail records showed costs of jailing Hasan were about $540,000 (June 2013).
-Inmate requests: after the trial, Bell County released 21 handwritten requests showing the
types of things Nidal Hasan had requested during his time there. It gave a glimpse into his
world.
