Applying CAR to non-metro beats
** Even though you're off the city desk, don't discount government agencies as data sources. For
example, the Federal Communications Commission has data on every radio and TV station in the
nation. The Internal Revenue Service can provide financial data on non-profits, including local
arts groups. The Education Department tracks public libraries, and also collects data on college
sports programs. Also don’t forget campaign finance data – you never know which celebrity or
sports star might turn up.
**Mine Census data for features topics, such as living alone, marriage and family trends, etc.
**Be prepared to find very few “ready-made” databases. Data manipulation skills to transform
non-delimited files into databases and knowing how to build your own database are extremely
helpful.
Build-your-own database ideas:
n Create a local best-selling books list or a local best-selling albums list using data
from local stores.
n Collect salaries of local high school or college coaches and keep track of it from year
to year in order to track increases in salaries.
n Build a database of injuries at local concerts based on EMT or hospital reports.
**There may be some ready-made databases kept by private entities that you might be able to
negotiate for. Most often these entities are not experienced in filling data requests, so be prepared
for lots of “we can’t do that” when they really mean “we’ve never done that.” Brush up on your
data negotiation tactics from previous NICAR tipsheets and listserv messages.
Examples of private data you might be able to get:
n In entertainment, Soundscan, Bookscan and Nielsen EDI track music, books and film
box office, respectively. In some cases, they will break out data for your market.
n In sports, the professional sports leagues are private companies, but they keep
mounds of data and sometimes might cough some of it up for you. Statistical services
are a better source, if your company subscribes.
**Look at your beat like a hard-news beat, even if that's not your normal focus. For instance,
home editors often can get access to Multiple Listing Service records, which can lead to great
database stories. Think of every agency and organization on your beat and try to find out how
they keep records.
**Even if your beat is non-metro, try to do at least one revelatory/watchdog project a year. Do it
in bits and pieces for awhile, then convince your editor you need concentrated time to finish it.
Do it to help your readers, to help yourself learn new skills, and to produce something hard that
you're proud of.
