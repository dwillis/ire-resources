Investigating Unlikely Disasters:
Post‐Disaster Approaches

Many natural and manmade disasters
occur rarely but can cause terrible
harm: big earthquakes, tsunamis,
lethal tornados, large oil spills, nuclear
accidents, chemical explosions, etc.
“The absence of an accident does not mean
that you have a safe system."
Jim Hall, former chairman, National
Transportation Safety Board

Emergency preparedness plans are
predicated on assumptions about
two things

1) likelihood of disaster
2) potential severity

1) Investigate past accidents
AP INVESTIGATION: Oil rig blowout preventers have
long history of breaking down at other wells
By JEFF DONN and SETH BORENSTEIN , Associated Press Writers

HOUSTON (AP) _ Cutoff valves like the one that
failed to stop the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster have
repeatedly broken down at other wells in the years
since federal regulators weakened testing
requirements, according to an Associated Press
investigation.

2) Investigate latest accident
Workers describe failures on oil rig before
explosion in Gulf of Mexico
By Jeff Donn, Michael Kunzelman, and Mike Baker

Dozens of witness statements obtained by
The Associated Press show a combination of
equipment failures and a deference to the chain
of command impeded the system that should
have stopped the gusher before it became an
environmental disaster.

Investigate prevention plan
AP Exclusive: Fukushima tsunami plan a
single page
By JUSTIN PRITCHARD, YURI KAGEYAMA , Associated Press Writer

TOKYO — Japanese nuclear regulators trusted
that the reactors at the Fukushima Dai‐ichi
complex were safe from the worst waves an
earthquake could muster based on a single‐page
memo from the plant operator nearly a decade
ago.

3) Investigate future accidents
Gulf awash in 27,000 abandoned wells
By JEFF DONN, MITCH WEISS, Associated Press Writers

More than 27,000 abandoned oil and gas wells
lurk in the hard rock beneath the Gulf of Mexico,
an environmental minefield that has been
ignored for decades. No one — not industry, not
government — is checking to see if they are
leaking, an Associated Press investigation shows.

Investigate safety culture
AP IMPACT: Revolving door connects
Japanese nuke industry, sympathetic
government regulators
Justin Pritchard,Yuri Kageyama, Associated Press writers

An Associated Press review of Japan's approach
to nuclear plant safety shows how closely
intertwined relationships between government
regulators and industry have allowed a culture of
complacency to prevail.
