How does this happen?
• Both men were sentenced by the same judge in
the same courtroom.
• Each only had a single misdemeanor on their
records.
• They tallied the exact same points on the
scoresheets that set criminal punishment.
• Legleitner spent less than two years in county jail.
He is now free to golf and fish on the weekends.
• Lloyd is still in prison. He will be 47 upon his
release in 2034.
• The only obvious difference between the two
men is the color of their skin.

Florida’s court system
is rife with racism.

Blacks are found
guilty more often than
whites.

Blacks are given fewer
chances to erase their
convictions or enter pretrial
diversion programs.

And blacks spend far
more time behind bars –
often receiving sentences
that are two or three
times longer than whites.

Nowhere is the injustice
more glaring than with
non-violent
drug offenses.

Blacks are given more time than
whites in all but burglary

Breaking new ground
• No news outlet in the U.S. has ever taken a
comprehensive look at a statewide judicial system.
• We used a database with 82 million records that tracks
every criminal case in Florida from arrest through
appeal.
• The OBTS database allowed us to analyze guilty rates
and average sentence lengths for blacks and whites for
six different crimes and all felonies.
• We then checked those results against a second
database with 1.4 million records from the
Department of Corrections.
• The DOC data allowed us to compare sentences on a
much more granular level. We can see the points
defendants received in sentencing and compare them.

Florida’s sentencing system is broken
• Judges say they have little discretion when it comes to
sentencing due to the criminal punishment code – a
scoring system that assigns points based on the offense
and prior history. The higher the points, the more time
behind bars.
• The idea was to create uniform sentencing across the
state.
• If someone in Pensacola was convicted of the same
crime as a person in Key West, they would be treated
the same, no matter the race or economic
circumstances.
• But the system doesn’t work, and we will show
multiple examples of this throughout the series.

Implicit bias
• A Jacksonville judge was reassigned earlier this
year after saying that all blacks should “go back
to Africa.”
• But examples of overt racism are rare.
• Experts say the racial sentencing discrepancies
more likely linked to implicit biases.
• These biases stem from fear deeply rooted in our
racial history.
• Blacks and whites live in different cultures and
lack understanding of each other.

Judge Sherwood Bauer
19th Circuit, Martin, Okeechobee, St Lucie
Since 2009, he’s had 22 reversals on appeal.

• 574% more time to blacks for robbery
• 126% more time for felony drugs
• 95% more time for marijuana
• 67% more time for battery
• 62% more for first degree felonies
• 57% more for second degree felonies
• 51% more time for DWLS, third offense

Day 3
• Alachua County is known for zero tolerance
towards drugs.
• Law enforcement wages its war primarily in East
Gainesville, a historically black neighborhood.
• Meanwhile, the state’s flagship university and its
students have been left alone, despite rampant
drug use.
• College students are perceived to have a future
and high numbers of arrests will reflect poorly on
the university. The lives of blacks, on the other
hand, don’t matter.

Policing in East Gainesville
• Liberal county officials have been fighting to cut
down on drug arrests in East Gainesville, but law
enforcement won’t back off.
• That’s because they profit from the war on drugs.
• Since 2004, the Sheriff’s Office and Gainesville
Police seized more than $10 million in cash and
assets from drug offenders. They received
another $2.6 million in federal grants to combat
drugs.
