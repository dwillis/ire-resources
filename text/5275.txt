Create a story plan:
Creating a story plan is a helpful first step in keeping your story focused and organized with
reporting and storytelling elements. A solid story plan identifies:










The story’s premise (What is the story about?)
If the story will be done as a partnership (e.g. internal or external partnership, roles and
responsibilities, etc.)
The medium(s) to best tell the story (i.e. television, radio, digital text and/ or video,
social media video, podcast, infographs, etc.)
A list of the rules/laws that govern the issue
The data/documents that support the story
Facts, stats & interviews
Your photography/video elements
Your digital interactive elements
Your social media/engagement strategy
Graphics needed (digital, broadcast, social, etc.)
Target release date

Partnerships:
Partnerships within your organization or with an external partner can be very rewarding but
also quite tricky. In the initial discussions make sure everyone involved in the project is on the
same page. It’s important to identify who will take the lead on various aspects of the story and
for each platform. It’s often helpful to identify a person(s) who will oversee the coordination of
elements and keep the team accountable to a rollout plan.

Determine if your story will be told in a single report or in multiple parts. With either
approach, make sure there is a strong push to the web before and after the story airs.
If your organization/outlet covers multiple markets, consider customizing your reporting
based on data points unique to a particular market. It’s a great way to maximize the
breadth and depth of the story.
Less is often more. A story doesn’t always have to have numerous digital elements. The
digital presentation should help underscore your reporting, tease out key aspects and
inform your audience (in a creative/engaging way).

Consider multiple-part rollout:


Rolling out your investigation in multiple parts gives you more depth in each angle, and
can increase traction and results.
Tease ahead to your next angle
Call for impacted viewers to contact you and compile pertinent data from each
Break “results” stories as they happen, don't forget to include your process and show
your work

Consider going digital first:
What? I’ve spent the past three months nurturing my precious investigation and it’s not going
on TV first? WTF? Don’t think of digital as “less than.” It is not competing with, but rather
cultivating a richer television audience. So how do you pull it off?

Custom URL—research shows young news consumers don’t like to go to traditional local
news websites. So…? Create your own URL (i.e. bodycamtransparency.com) that piggybacks to a custom page on your station’s site.
Create a “movement.” By launching digitally and with a strong social push, your
investigation grows organically and becomes part of the social discussion.
What should the social push look like? There’s no one right answer. BUT TRY NOT TO
THINK OF THEM AS TEASES! Make them vignettes with information! With Facebook,
make sure to use visual copy points—research shows more than 85% of Facebook
viewing is done without sound!
Social infographics—these are compelling factoids—gold info nuggets that you or your
art department can dress up and make pretty.
Piggyback off stakeholder groups to reach a wider audience. Doing a police
investigation? How many followers does the local P.D. have? How about the police
union? ACLU? NAACP? Justice advocacy groups? Identify associations, affinity groups,
non-profits, etc. Reach out to them ahead of time and encourage them to share your
story on social media.
Incorporate the social discussion when you launch on TV. Instead of your anchor intro
being: “Now, a three month investigation into ____”, it becomes “Now to our three
month investigation that thousands are already talking about”…

After your story releases, follow-up with stakeholders and monitor engagement – you never
know if it’ll lead to a new story or a follow-up piece. When possible, track analytics as it can
help in the story planning process of future stories.
