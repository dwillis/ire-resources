Whether you work together every day on a long project, or just work together for one
day on a quick-turn, you can make your piece better by working as a team with your
photojournalist.
*think partnership: from conceptualization to final edit
*give ownership: from research to selection of interviewees to final re-write
*talk continuously: start to finish
*talk first, shoot later
*give photojournalist script early for “creative incubation” time
*work together on production techniques

Here are some production techniques to help make a cohesive, visually interesting
piece:
Keys to making documents interesting:
*select key words for maximum impact
*make sure track emphasizes those words
*try using lighting to point viewers eyes to key words
*using sound for emotion: sound effects; nat sots of documents
*discuss what you want viewers to feel
*match “read” to the mood

Keys to working as a team for better hidden identity interviews
*allow time for photojournalist team member to set up
*offer to change places with interviewee so they see how it will look
*work as a team to make people comfortable

Move the camera
*accommodate long section of track with movement in video
*try a dolly shot over a document
*use a specialized camera like a lipstick cam on documents for effect
*reporter: watch the production – be prepared to re-track to perfect timing as needed

Keys to using stand-ups effectively
*don’t be afraid to write a long stand up
*think segments; break a longer stand up into a series of stand-ups
*use props: think miniatures – dolls, toys, game pieces
*team discussion on how to interact with props
*use monitor shots – roll video in large screen in the monitor behind reporter in stand-up
*make it perfect. It’s the one thing you have control over
