Soft Money at the state level:
Contributions to political parties — given by unions, corporations and wealthy
individuals —for administrative expenses, party building and get-out-the-vote activities
that do not support or oppose candidates in federal elections. Contributors (including
those barred from giving “hard money”) can donate unlimited amounts of soft money.
The same activity takes place at the state level, however it isn’t always labeled “soft
money” since the traditional definition applies only to federal races. Unless a state has
specific laws that restrict the type of contributions to political parties, all of the money
those committees collect can be considered soft money. If Shays-Meehan is signed into
law, get ready to see even more money flooding this direction!
How to obtain data:
• State party contribution and expenditure data is available from your state
agency that oversees campaign finance. Usually this is the Secretary of State
office. Other times it is through the Ethics Administration. (see list of those
states with electronic data). States charge between 10 and 50 cents per page to
photocopy and ship the reports to you. The cost of electronic data varies by
state – some provide it for free, others charge for the processing time. The
most we’ve paid is $120 for Alaska and $100 for California (for 1 year each).
The hurdles:
• Very little of the data is in an electronic format. In some states, the paper reports
are handwritten and difficult to read.
• The forms for reporting contributions and expenditures vary greatly from state to
state. Most states do little to police either the submission of these reports or the
content. Sometimes committees within the same state will file forms that
physically look different.
• Dirty Data galore! Duplicates, spelling errors, amended records mixed in with
originals, missing information, inconsistency in how to label purpose of
expenditure or occupation of contributor.
• Avoiding double counting. Beware of funds transferred from one committee to
another – you might double-count money if you just total up all the money
received when looking at more than one committee.
• Expenditure data is particularly nasty. Most states don’t have consistent
guidelines (or codes) for how the committees list the purpose of the expenditure.

Studies by University of Massachusetts political science professor, Raymond LaRaja,
have tracked state party expenditures and are particularly insightful and easy to
