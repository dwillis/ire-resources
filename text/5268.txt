Who should I trust as
a foreign journalist
writing about
Afghanistan?
NPR journalists David Gilkey
and Zabihullah Tamanna died
a year ago ]ambushed on a
remote road in southern
Afghanistan while on a
reporting assignment
traveling with the Afghan
National Army.
]NPR find that the two men
were not the random victims
of bad timing in a dangerous
place as the report said but .
the journalists' convoy was
specifically targeted by
attackers who had been
tipped off to the presence of
Americans journalist.

investigative report about poppy or corruption

3. Do not shear information about your field tripe
