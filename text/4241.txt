Director of Congressional Budget Office, 2003-2005

What is Medicare Advantage?
• Known as Part C
• Created by Congress in 1997 as
Medicare+Choice
• Attempt to offer a privatization option
• Built around the Preferred Payer Option (PPO)
and Health Maintenance Organization (HMO)
models

So why is it called MA?
• Renamed Medicare Advantage by Congress
with Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003
• Changed the compensation and business
practices of private insurers that offer MA
plans
• Incentivized to take sicker patients based on
risk scoring

Remember
• Patients love it
• Therefore, Congress supports it

What you’ll need

Compared to what

http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/HealthPlans/MedicareAdvtgSpecRateStats/FFS-Data.html

Working with the data
• Joins in SQL or VLOOKUP in Excel to combine
the three tables together to get the Medicare
Advantage plans, MA enrollment at the county
level and the fee-for-service county data into
one table.
• Weight the MA plan risk scores by county
enrollment to compare MA and FFS risk
scores.

Caveats
• CMS calculations of the FFS risk scores, which
are done on a rolling basis in 5-year groups
rather than the single year calculation for MA
risk scores
• No patient information, such as diagnosis or
demographics
