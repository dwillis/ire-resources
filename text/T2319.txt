Central Personnel Data File: The CPDF is a database of all Federal civilian employees.
For more information about the database go to http://www.opm.gov/feddata/guidance.asp
This database is available from the federal Office of Personnel Management.

EEO-1 Data File: This database is from the Equal Opportunity Employment
Commission. This is summary data of employees of all private business with 100 or more
employees who fall under the Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Smaller
employers also have to report if they are part of a larger company whose workforce totals
more than 100 employees and Defense contractors with more than 50 employees and
more than $50,000 in contracts. The data is available by state, MSA, SIC and NAICS
codes. http://www.eeoc.gov/stats/jobpat/jobpat.html

Environmental Protection Agency’s Compliance and Enforcement History dataset:
A database of civil enforcements by the EPA. The data can be accessed at
http://www.epa.gov/echo/index.html . You can look up information online of all
enforcement activities at local companies or download the data as a comma delimited text
file. The data can also be ordered from the EPA. Mother Jones magazine used the data in
an analysis of federal contractors who violated federal environmental law. The article is
called “Unjust Rewards”.
CDC WONDER: Several datasets of public health data from the Centers for Disease
Control. The data is available online and can be downloaded. The datasets include
mortality data, injuries, etc. The data is available at http://wonder.cdc.gov/. The
Cleveland Plain Dealer used this data to look at health disparities by race across the
country.
Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization Services: Immigration data from the
agency formally known as the INS. Data is available by year and can be downloaded in
Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. http://uscis.gov/graphics/shared/aboutus/statistics/110.htm

Excluded Party List System: EPLS is the electronic version of the Lists of Parties
Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs (Lists), which
identifies those parties excluded throughout the U.S. Government (unless otherwise
noted) from receiving Federal contracts or certain subcontracts and from certain types of
Federal financial and nonfinancial assistance and benefits. The data is collected and
maintained by the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security. The data
is located at http://epls.arnet.gov/epls/servlet/EPLSSearchMain/1
Single Audit Database: The Single Audit database contains information on local
nonprofits and state or local government agencies that receive substantial assistance from
the federal government. The Office of Management and Budget requires audits of those
organizations if they reach a certain dollar threshold, typically $300,000, in federal
assistance. The database lists all the federal sources of the organizations' expenditures
and the amounts spent, starting in 1997. The data also includes notations about whether
the audits have revealed any problems, plus valuable contact information, including
names, addresses and phone numbers, for the organizations being audited and the
auditors.
The data is available from IRE at http://www.ire.org/datalibrary/databases/fedaudit/ or
can be searched at http://harvester.census.gov/sac/ . The Star Tribune used the Single
Audit database to examine spending by local Indian tribes after the tribes refuse to share
information on how it was spending federal dollars.

Bureau of Transportation Statistics Transborder Surface Freight Data: Established
in response to NAFTA, This database provides North American merchandise trade data
by commodity type, by surface mode of transportation (rail, truck, pipeline, mail and
other), and with geographic detail for United States (U.S.) exports to and imports from
Canada and Mexico. For example, you can see how much beef was sent from your state
to a province in Canada or state in Mexico. You can also do the reverse, finding how
much of a product from those countries were sold in your state. The data can be searched
online or downloaded in .dbf format from http://www.bts.gov/ntda/tbscd/prod.html

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s Electric Quarterly Reports: The
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission requires public utilities and power marketers to
file Electric Quarterly Reports which summarize all contracts and transactions. With this
you can see how much energy you local utility is selling or purchasing on the open
market. Files can be downloaded by quarter at http://www.ferc.gov/docs-filing/eqr.asp.
The Roanoke Times used these filings for a series called “A Question of Power”. The
newspaper was able to show that a local utility’s attempt to build a power line through
Southwest Virginia was driven more by energy sales than system reliability as the
company claimed.

National Fire Incident Reporting System: NFIRS is a national reporting system used
by U.S. fire departments to report fires and other incidents to which they respond. The
data can be order from U.S. Fire Administration or in most cases gotten from your local
Fire Marshal’s Office since nearly all fire departments uses the NFIRS software to
collected information. Information on the data can be found here:
http://usfa.fema.gov/nfirs/ . See The Boston Globe’s recent series on fire department
response times at http://www.boston.com/news/specials/fires/

Bonus site:
The Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse or TRAC:
TRAC collects dozens of database from the federal government under FOIA and post
them to its site at http://trac.syr.edu. Although this is a paid subscription site, there are
still tons of free reports and data available as well. TRAC is based at Syracuse University
and co-founded by former New York Times reporter David Burnham
