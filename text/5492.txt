WAIT A SEC… THIS PROBLEM ISN’T SPECIFIC TO
AFRICA, LET’S GO GLOBAL!

IN THIS SHORT PRESENTATION WE WILL:
➔

Learn what’s sensor journalism

➔

See examples from around the world

➔

Answer some of the questions you may
have about sensor journalism

➔

Invite you to contribute to the Sensor
Journalism Toolkit

WHAT’S SENSOR
JOURNALISM?

“Sensor journalism can be defined as the use of
sensors to generate or collect data, then analyzing,
visualizing, or using the data to support journalistic
inquiry.”

@Maid_Marianne @HeiDaHQ | #NICAR18

8

QUESTION FOR YOU:
What sort of data can
you collect with
sensors?

@Maid_Marianne @HeiDaHQ | #NICAR18

9

Sensors can be used to
detect just about any
physical element.

@Maid_Marianne @HeiDaHQ | #NICAR18

10

AIR QUALITY

WATER QUALITY

TRANSPORTS

TEMPERATURES

LANDSCAPE

ACCESS TO
MEDECINES

@Maid_Marianne @HeiDaHQ | #NICAR18

11

THREE SENSORS YOU MAY
ALREADY KNOW ABOUT
AND OWN

@Maid_Marianne @HeiDaHQ | #NICAR18

12

An accelerometer detects changes in gravitational
acceleration in a device it's installed in, such as a
smartphone or a game controller, to determine
acceleration, tilt and vibration.

@Maid_Marianne @HeiDaHQ | #NICAR18

13

A photosensor detects the presence of visible
light, infrared transmission (IR) and/or
ultraviolet (UV) energy.

@Maid_Marianne @HeiDaHQ | #NICAR18

14

“GPS units inside phones gets a ping from a satellite up in
space to figure out which part of the planet you’re standing on
(or driving through). They don’t actually use any of your
phone’s data, which is why you can still see your location when
your phone has lost signal, even if the map tiles themselves
are a blurry, low-res mess.”

22

WHERE DO YOU GET SENSOR DATA?

@Maid_Marianne @HeiDaHQ | #NICAR18

23

TO DO SENSOR JOURNALISM YOU CAN:
- USE EXISTING SENSOR DATA
- COLLECT DATA BY PUTTING SENSORS AROUND
- COLLECT DATA FROM SENSORS DEPLOYED BY
THE GENERAL PUBLIC

WHAT DOES SENSOR DATA LOOK LIKE?
MOST OF THE TIME, LIKE ANY OTHER

IT MAY REQUIRE EXTRA RESEARCH TO
UNDERSTAND THE FORMAT (BUT
NOTHING TOO DIFFICULT)

REMEMBER I TOLD YOU ABOUT OUR
PROJECT TO BUILD A SENSOR
JOURNALISM TOOLKIT?

@Maid_Marianne @HeiDaHQ | #NICAR18

45

WHAT’S OUR PROJECT ABOUT?

An easy-to-use sensor journalism toolkit that empowers journalists by
helping them understand, find or gather datasets using sensor tech.

@Maid_Marianne @HeiDaHQ | #NICAR18

46

WHY ARE WE DOING IT?

@Maid_Marianne @HeiDaHQ | #NICAR18

47

FOR ALL JOURNALISTS, EVERYWHERE
IN THE WORLD. FIRST IN ENGLISH,
THEN IN OTHER LANGUAGES.

@Maid_Marianne @HeiDaHQ | #NICAR18

48

An online platform gathering:
-

A Sensor Journalism Handbook in
English and French

-

A Sensor Guide

-

A template to visualise data from
sensors

-

A ready-to-use SMS query system for
to help journalists push alerts to the
public

-

A forum

@Maid_Marianne @HeiDaHQ | #NICAR18

WHAT’S IN THE TOOLKIT?

49

+ A PILOT
PROJECT

At launch, the Sensor Journalism
Toolkit will also feature pilot projects
showcasing the usefulness of this
initiative and the possible outcome of
sensor-driven journalism.

@Maid_Marianne @HeiDaHQ | #NICAR18

50

WHERE/WHEN WILL IT START?

We are looking for partners around the
world for a launch at the end of 2018.

What is remote sensing?

Gathering data and
imagery from a
distance with
satellites or aircrafts
RemoteSnsg-fig2.gif

Resolution
● Different data sources have different resolutions
● “15m” - 1px in the image corresponds to one 15m x 15m
square on the ground
● Free satellite imagery (Landsat, Sentinel) usually has
higher revisit rates for lower res imagery

Pansharpening
Panchromatic
sharpening:
Merging high-res
single-band
imagery with
low-res multi-band
imagery.

Mapbox

(Some) tools to get and process data
● QGIS / ArcGIS - for GIS
● GDAL - sort of like QGIS in the command line
● Google Earth Engine - for fast processing on
Google’s servers
● Photoshop - for rasters
● Illustrator - to put it all together

Don’t be afraid to reach out to data sources!
● GIS/data specialists at certain NASA/NOAA
agencies
● For-profit companies who are willing to provide
free data for newsrooms
● Cartographic researchers
