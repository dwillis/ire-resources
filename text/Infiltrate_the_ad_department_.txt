Infiltrate
the ad department!

Early 2010: Mobile traffic
exploding, and we wanted to cash in

Local advertisers weren't mobile yet,
not enough $$ to share with vendor

The pitch: We'll build you
an ad system that doesn't suck

Step 1) Put readers first

Goals for readers
● ads that fit the feel of the site
● ads that were useful in mobile
context

Goals for sales staff
● easy to build an ad without
designer
● easy to schedule and track
● sales tool: automatic landing page
for advertisers without mobile sites

Step 2) Treat ads as
data

Step 3) Hey, ads people like

Current status
● made some $$
● increased engagement with ads
● no reader complaints, but some
reader compliments ;)

● let advertisers change messages
via social media updates

ads in a variety of contexts

Ultimate goal:

suck.
