My CD gives you quick and easy access to selected statistics collected by the U.S.
Census Bureau’s 2014 American Community Survey 1-year estimates and 2013 County
Business Patterns (CBP) for the 114th Congressional Districts
Newest version of My CD with CBP was released in mid-February
Categories include: People (ACS), Workers (ACS), Housing (ACS), Socio-Economic
(ACS), Education (ACS), Business (CBP)
My CD not only provides household based estimates from the ACS, but also business
information from CBP. It gives you a holistic economic picture of workers (ACS) and
employers (CBP).
You can download information and/or embed widget on your own webpage

CBP statistics provide the only annual data at the local level on the number of
establishments, employees, and annual payroll for nearly 1,200 industries at the
national, state, county, and now congressional district level.
CBP data include the number of establishments, employment during the week of March
12, and annual payroll. CBP basic data are extracted from the Business Register (BR), a
database of all known single and multi-establishment employer companies maintained
and updated by the U.S. Census Bureau.
Primary causes of differences between CBP employment estimates and ACS estimates:
CBP does not cover the self-employed, public employment, and most agricultural
employment; CBP estimates are not based on a sample survey; they represent business
location as opposed to workers' residence in the district; use the week of March 12 as a
reference period; and use a business source to determine industry. - See more at:

Census Business Builder (CBB) provides selected demographic and economic data
from the Census Bureau tailored to specific types of users in a simple to access and
use format
CBB includes two editions: Small Business Edition (released in 2015) and Regional
Analyst Edition (RAE) (released January 2016)
CBB: RAE includes over 50 statistics from demographic/socioeconomic/housing
characteristics (2010-2014 ACS 5-year estimates – the map already shows this current
data and the report will be updated with the current ACS on 3/21), information for
employer businesses (2012 County Business Patterns, 2012 Economic Census),
information for nonemployer businesses (2012 Nonemployer Statistics), consumer
spending data (2015 Esri)
CBB: RAE allows you to build your region using one or more counties
Scenario: Reporter wants information for region composed of multiple counties for story

•
•
•

Go to https://www.census.gov/data/data-tools/cbb.html, then click on “Regional Analyst
Edition” link
Enter “Denver County, Colorado” in the county search box and click “Go to Map”
Expand the “Region 1” box in the lower left corner of the screen, then click “Edit Region”

Click on a neighboring county (such as Adams County, CO to the north of Denver), then
click “Add to My Region”
When you finish adding counties, click “Done Editing” on the left side of the screen
Click “Create Region Report”
The Local Business Profile opens in a separate tab. In the top right corner, it tells you
what the region is comprised of. In the top left corner, you can print the page. Note: this
tool aggregates characteristics for the counties you select (most tools don’t do this)
Scenario: Reporter wants to visualize where people with a certain characteristic (i.e.,
high income) live in a certain area

Go back to the CBB: RAE page. You can also use this tool to filter by variables.
In the upper left corner, change the geography to “ZIP Code”
Under “Select Map Variable,” change “Total population” to “Average income ($)”
(Primary CategoryàConsumer/Residential, Secondary CategoryàSocioeconomic
Characteristics, Map VariableàAverage Income, click “Select Variable”). You now see
average income by ZCTA mapped on the screen.
Under “Select Your Filter,” click “Add New Filter” and pick “Average income ($)” again
(Primary CategoryàConsumer/Residential, Secondary CategoryàSocioeconomic
Characteristics, Map VariableàAverage Income, click “Select Variable”). Next, click
“Select Variable.”
Select the filter value by sliding the bar to the right, then click “Apply Filter.” You should
now only see ZIP Codes shaded in that meet your filter requirements.
