Managing Up
Buy in/selling the story
 Be both a champion and a buffer.
 Be enthusiastic, but measured.
 Put the strongest face on what you know you have, but…
 Don’t oversell either the premise or the timeframe.
 Use the minimum/maximum approach.

Ongoing communication
 Meet frequently with the boss.
 Informal meetings are fine, if they take place regularly.
 If not, set up a schedule of update sessions.
 These sessions are addition to any formal, periodic project meetings you
hold with all managers.
Have an agenda
 Know in advance what one or two thoughts you want your boss to come
away with, Keep it simple.
 Distill problems as much as possible. Avoid technical/overwrought
explanations.
 Keep the conversation focused instead on the story, the journalism. Again,
keep it simple.
Bring a taste of what’s to come.
 A cool graphic or promising story top will get the boss juiced and convey
the progress you’re making.
Ongoing education of bosses
• Make it an ongoing process to elevate the level of understanding about
investigative techniques among senior editors.

•
•
•

Hold touchbach sessions post-publication – explaining how various
investigative approaches and techniques made the story better.
Build from one story to the next.
Hold constructive post-mortems on how it could have worked better, with an
eye toward the future

Building trust through reliability tops your job description.
• Establish a record of success.
• Make commitments that are challenging but livable.
• Know enough about your boss’s expectations and the investigative process so
that you make firm commitments.
• Set realistic deadlines and then hold to them, including interim deadlines.
• Don’t get squeezed into an unrealistic deadline box – you and your story get
nothing from that.
• If the boss doesn’t want to wait, be precise in explaining how that decision
will impact the story.
• If your story is CAR-related, set an early data deadline.
• Allow plenty of time for accuracy checks, such as field testing and talking to
experts.
• Coordinate with the rest of the newsroom – photo, graphics, newsdesk
copydesk, internet.
• Call the lawyers yourself; don’t wait for others to do it.
The good news: Senior editors are allies. The good ones know that investigative
stories are part of what differentiate us from other media. They know that today’s readers
expect added value from journalists, and these stories are a great way to showcase that
strength.
