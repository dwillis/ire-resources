Base functionality is super easy to use, but it's more configurable if you tap into the API
d3.js is a tough thing to learn if you want to code your own graphics from scratch. But
there are a bunch of d3 projects out there whose code you can adapt to your own use
just by swapping data and manipulating a few lines of code

All visualizations are responsive. Also functions as a data storytelling tool that can
incorporate images, video, embedded audio, download files, and text. Includes simple
mapping (Google Maps) that does not require geocoding. Allows beginners to generate
14 different chart types. 3k row size limitation. Best for small to mid-sized datasets.
Very nice integrated mapping. Easy to embed on third-party sites.
