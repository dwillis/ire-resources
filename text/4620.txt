 Algorithm: A set of instructions

 Pair up with 1 partner

 Draw a triangle, a square and a circle on a

sheet of paper
 Each of the shapes can be shaded or unshaded
 The shapes vary in size
 The shapes can be in any location (including

overlapping, inside each other, etc)
 DON’T let your partner see it

 Now instruct your partner on how to draw the

shapes
 They can’t look at your paper
 You can’t look at their paper

A variable stores information and has a name. There are several types.

•Day = “Thursday”
• Numbers: Numbers. Can be stored as whole numbers (integers) or decimals (floats)
•ConferenceAttendees = 400
•SessionLength = 1
•SessionFinished = .20
• Booleans: True or false values.
•isCircle = False
•isSaturday = False
•isAwesome = True
• Arrays: A collection of elements. Can be different types or the same type. Has length
•Kids = [“John”,”Kara”,”Paul”]
•luckyThings = [7, “Rabbit’s Foot”]
•electionYears = [2016, 2012, 2008]

 Numbers: Can be stored as whole numbers

(integers) or decimals (floats)
 Booleans: True or false values.
 Arrays: A collection of elements. Can be different

NICAR objects have four variables:
Name ( String)
YearsAtJob (Number)
FirstTimeAtNICAR? (Boolean)
NamesofColleaguesHere (Array)

 Variables: Name , YearsAtJob ,

FirstTimeAtNICAR, NamesofColleaguesHere
 Our Conditionals:
 1.

Performs different operations or actions based
on a if a boolean condition evaluates to true
or false
 If someCondition is True:
 Do something

 Else:
 Do something else

 If FirstTimeAtNICAR is True:
 Step forward

 Else:
 Do nothing

 If FirstTimeAtNICAR is True:
 Step forward
▪ Raise right foot
▪ Move right foot forward
▪ Put down right foot
▪ Raise left foot
▪ Move left foot forward
▪ Put down left foot

 Else:
 Do nothing

 Step forward()
▪ Raise right foot
▪ Move right foot forward
▪ Put down right foot
▪ Raise left foot
▪ Move left foot forward
▪ Put down left foot
A collection of computer statements that achieve a
specific purpose in an overall program. Can be called
many times without rewriting code.

 Lindsey is a coffee making robot

 She needs some information from you:
 LumpsofSugar (number)
 Roast (string)
 Lid? (boolean)

Function MakeCoffee (LumpsofSugar, Roast,
Lid )
//how do I make this?

For all the people in the room:
Function MakeCoffee (LumpsofSugar, Roast, Lid )
Loops: Repeat blocks of code while a condition is
true, or a certain number of times.

 Print out the numbers 1-100

 For numbers that are multiples of 3, print Fizz

instead of the number
 For numbers that are multiples of 5, print
Buzz instead of the number
 For numbers that are multiples of both 5 and
4, print FizzBuzz

For number 1-100 (loop)
If number divisible by 3 AND if number
divisible by 5
print Fizzbuzz
Else If number divisible by 3
print Fizz
Else If number divisible by 5
print Buzz
Else:
print number

R - statistics-driven language. Primarily used for data
analysis and statistical computing
 SQL - programming language built specifically for working
with relational databases. A great entry point into
“programming” if you are coming from an excel
background and want to work with larger data sets and
perform higher-level analysis.
 Python - general purpose language. Great for beginners
looking to learn basic concepts because its syntax is
simple and easy to read. Useful as both a tool for data
analysis and for the web. Useful when working with GIS
data.


 Ruby can also be used for data analysis, as its a server-side

scripting language like Python

Useful for data visualizations, graphics, interactives and web
programming in general
 HTML & CSS are the standard foundations of the web. Essential
for web design and development - impossible to make anything
for the web without writing any HTML or CSS.
 Javascript - Considered the “programming language of the web.”
Next step in learning web development after learning HTML &
CSS. Vanilla javascript is an important foundation for web
programming before moving on to more complicated visualization
libraries like D3.js


 JQuery falls under this as well, but understanding javascript without

the help of JQuery is important



D3.js - a javascript library used to manipulate and visualize data on
the web. Uses data to power SVG. Very popular for creating
graphics on the web.

Python & Django: Django is a web framework for Python. Has a lot
of flexibility and useful for data analysis as well. Not as easy to set
up or deploy as Rails, but since python is a very flexible language,
Django is also pretty flexible
 Ruby & Ruby on Rails: Rails is a web framework for Ruby. Very easy
to get set up and get started, so a common choice for people
interested in learning web development quickly, but sometimes
harder to understand next steps beyond basic setup.
 Node.js: A server-side language written in javascript, so a common
choice for front-end developers fluent in javascript looking to work
on the back-end without learning a new language.
 Ruby, Python and Node.js are all useful in building tools for
automation and setting up servers
