Building an AI Ethics Beat
With a Local/Community Focus

Journalists won’t necessarily find this groundbreaking, but these are some of the steps I’ve
taken to build my knowledge and sourcing and generate AI and Tech Ethics story ideas.
What Is AI Ethics?
AI Ethics is a discipline, arena of study or practice focusing on the ethical issues raised by the
design, development, implementation and use of artificial intelligence technologies.
Beat Building Process Suggestions
Read, Read, Read
I read – a lot, and still do. I read Cathy O’Neil’s Weapons of Math Destruction, one of many
books addressing algorithmic and machine learning technologies and their negative impacts.

I read reports from groups such as AI Now Institute and Data and Society and signed up to get
email updates from them. I read coverage of AI technologies. I perused government documents
addressing AI ethics topics – most from the past few years and most out of Europe. I
downloaded academic papers. I signed up for email newsletters such as MIT Technology
Review’s The Algorithm (https://go.technologyreview.com/newsletters/the-algorithm/).
I wasn’t doing anything special – just going where the rabbit hole led me.
News Alerts and Twitter
In the meantime, I created Google alerts – literally for the phrase “AI ethics” and keywords
related to specific topics such as facial recognition and AI bias. I made sure to read articles
touching on issues related to AI and the ethics questions – most addressed scary prospects like
robots taking our jobs and the use of discriminatory AI tools in law enforcement or hiring
scenarios. Through my own reporting, I aimed to fill some gaps addressing issues others were
missing.
To keep abreast of the social media discussion around AI Ethics, I followed people on Twitter
discussing AI ethics news, subject matter and issues. I followed people they retweeted if they

seemed relevant. I followed academics immersed in this universe and found people based on
the various stuff I was reading. This not only helps generate story ideas, becoming part of the
conversation lends those stories and my reporting legitimacy.
Events
What did people talk about when they discussed concepts related to AI Ethics? I began by
attending an industry-centric AI conference. How was industry addressing ethics questions? Not
surprisingly, they checked off the box with a keynote and one or two side panels in small
rooms. But it was a start. I scheduled some interviews and randomly chatted up other
attendees about issues that I was interested in knowing more about, such as whether complex
algorithmic systems can really explain themselves.
Of course, it’s important to schedule interviews with speakers or attendees before events when
you can, and come prepared with a few questions you aim to answer or build insights
regarding. Is there a local tech meetup in town where people are discussing AI or AI Ethics
topics? Check it out.
Talk
This may seem obvious, but sometimes new journalists forget about the most important part of
reporting, picking up the phone or setting up in-person meetings and just plain talking to
people. Even if someone doesn’t seem like they’ll be a go-to source in the future, it’s valuable
to learn about how people with various experiences view the issues you’re researching. Grad
computer science students will have a whole different perspective than a local AI tech startup
CEO might.

The Issues
It became clear to me early on that the conversation around AI ethics is driven by a relatively
prevalent set of issues. These issues are the common in guidance from governments, academic
papers, in social media discussions, in books and reports and more.
Transparent and Explainable AI
Can the steps and processes an algorithm takes toward making a decision be made visible enough to
inspect and explain it?
Fairness and Anti-Discrimination
Do algorithmic systems produce fair and equitable outcomes that do not lead to discrimination?
Privacy, Data Rights and Governance
Where does data used to train AI systems come from? Has privacy been protected and is the data
properly secured from hacks, inappropriate access or re-identification?

Accountability, Compliance and Liability
Who is liable? Today the focus on legal compliance and liability tends to be on autonomous vehicles and
potential property and injury by robots or drones.
Workers’ Rights and The Future of Work
More than AI automation killing jobs, how does automated management affect workers? What is the
hidden human labor of AI?

Generating AI Ethics Stories for Your Community
Municipal Government Use of AI
How is local government using AI and automated decision systems in law enforcement? Does
your city have autonomous vehicle and drone testing plans? Is government providing
appropriate information to ensure community awareness and meaningful opportunity for
community engagement? How does AI used by local government affect policy?
Local Laws, Legislation or Regulations

Are local or state lawmakers addressing AI technologies in legislation or regulations? Are local
law firms or local activist groups discussing these issues?
Local Tech Industry
Who’s developing AI tech in your city? Are companies in the local region creating an AI sector
offering specialized services such as cloud storage or data annotation?
Education
Do AI firms have relationships with local colleges and universities? How are local universities
teaching AI or machine learning ethics? Are code schools addressing data privacy and ethical
questions related to data scraping? Are local k-12 school kids learning about tech literacy, data
privacy or interactions with everyday AI like Siri and Alexa?
Local Labor
Are local AI firms hiring? Are local workers involved in the AI gig economy, or is AI use in the
workplace affecting local workers?
