Joint Fundraising Committee Basics

Joint fundraising is fundraising conducted jointly by multiple political
committees.
The political committees involved form a new vehicle that becomes the joint
fundraising committee.
These vehicles have been around for a long time, but the Supreme Court’s
2014 decision in McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission, which
eliminated some obscure but important campaign contribution limits,
effectively supercharged them.
There must be a written agreement that lays out how proceeds and expenses
will be divided between the committees involved, and when the committees
solicit money, they must tell donors how it will be divvied up.

So what?

JFC donors can write checks equal to the total of the collective contribution
limits of the participating committees. That can reach high six figure
amounts. That means politicians raising money for JFCs are mingling with
big-dollar donors.
Political parties, weakened by a ban on soft money, are using JFCs and
special party accounts created a few years ago to level the playing field with
super PACs and other big-money vehicles.
The money passes through multiple political committees, which makes it
harder to track, even though it’s disclosed in Federal Election Commission
filings.

How can I write stories about this?
1. Are your politicians taking big checks featuring lots of
zeros?
2. Are your local bigwigs writing big checks featuring lots of
zeros?
3. Where does that money end up?
4. How is it being spent?
5. What do the people writing the checks want?
