United States government sites/or government data:
U.S. Immigration and Citizens Services (formerly the INS) website
http://uscis.gov/graphics/index.htm
You’ll find press releases, of course, but also helpful annual yearbooks with specific
stats on where immigrants are moving, trends in enforcement and contacts for district
offices nationwide and overseas.
Also U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (formerly INS and customs)
http://www.ice.gov
Border Patrol – US Customs and Border Protection, links to spokesmen and local office
phones: http://cbp.gov/
Links to the Federal Court websites
Links to all federal courts are at: http://www.uscourts.gov/
These include federal district, appeals and bankruptcy courts. You can search federal
court cases for defendants’ names or company names nationwide and also search by
statute (i.e. with the code number for illegal re-entry or other immigration-related cases).
It makes sense to get to know the federal prosecutor and federal public defender in your
area who handle immigration issues.
Get a log-on and you can get court records for pennies a page – and view case activity
and get attorneys’ names, phones and e-mails for free:
https://pacer.login.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/login.pl?court_id=00idx
Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse
http://trac.syr.edu/
A non-profit that has successfully sued the U.S. Justice Department for tons of data and
makes it available to reporters and researchers. Some of it is free, the rest you get for a
subscription fee. The ICE section is valuable to check out your region and see how its
enforcement record compares to others. There is a whole section on immigration courts
and you can get reports on immigration judges too.
The Executive Office of Immigration Review (EOIR) of the Department of Justice
http://www.usdoj.gov/eoir/
It oversees the immigration courts (which aren’t part of the ICE, etc. though they are part
of the Department of Justice). Among other things, there’s a pretty up-to-date report on
court performance. Immigration court hearings are generally open, but records are not.
Also has lists of stats, sanctioned lawyers, court locations, etc.

US Congress – Members of Congress, their staff and committee chairmen in both
Mexico and the US congress are key contacts for reporters.
Find the list of the members of the Senate’s immigration subcommittee at:
http://judiciary.senate.gov/about/subcommittees/immigration.cfm Members of congress
can assist with getting information on individual cases, or statistics on INS manpower,
etc You can use the service Thomas to keep up with bills: http://thomas.loc.gov. A list of
bills related to September 11th is posted at http://thomas.loc.gov/home/terrorleg.htm
US Department of State –http://www.state.gov/
Alerts and advisories, contacts, etc.
Deaths of Americans Abroad data is now online as well
http://travel.state.gov/law/family_issues/death/death_600.html

FBI Offices – this page has a link to all of them. Each has a press officer and a
searchable archive of press releases.
http://www.fbi.gov/contact/fo/fo.htm
The FBI is also the best source of crime statistics for all border states and cities (though
state governments and individual cities have this too.)
US Census bureau: For information on border population trends, languages spoken,
changes in Mexican-born or all Foreign born population on all cities, places, counties,
states, towns and the US as a whole. www.census.gov

State governments:
U.S.border states: Texas, Arizona, California, New Mexico
Mexican border states: Tamaulipas, Nuevo León, Chihuahua,Coahuila, Sonora
Baja California Norte. Each state has its own webpage and “portal” for public records –
“transparencia”
Each state also has a Procurador General de Justicia del Estado – PGJE in Mexico or
State’s Attorney General in the US. Find their contact information and e-mails on border
state webpages.
Another list of border links – collected and updated by Molly Molloy, a researcher at
NMSU and IRE member: http://lib.nmsu.edu/subject/bord/laguia/
Molly Molloy also runs one of the best border list-serves (in English). To receive it, email her at mollymolloy@gmail.com

non-profit with a great archive on human rights issues on the border – including statistics,
