How looking at the
Fiesta Bowl’s finances
(990s) resulted in the
CEO going to prison

Elite culture.
The bowl is run by four
non-profits.
The bowl pays no
income taxes.

A 990 is an annual tax return that must be filed
each year with the IRS by tax-exempt, non-profit
organizations.
Places to find 990s:
*guidestar.org
*citizenaudit.org
*http://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/
Tax-exempt organizations, by law, also must let
you view their 990 forms.

 Revenues and expenses: Lines 12 and 18

on the first page of current 990s.
 Net assets: Line 22 of first page (Shows
financial health)

 Salaries and perks: Two areas in 990. Look to see

if a non-profit is providing first-class airfare,
housing allowance, club dues or personal
services. (Highest compensated employees)

 Independent Contractors. From 2000 to

2009, the Fiesta Bowl spent nearly $1.5
million on lobbyists.

 From 2000 to 2009, the Fiesta Bowl spent $2.6

million on the Fiesta Frolic, an annual golf
retreat at a Phoenix-area resort for college
officials. (See Business Transactions)

 The bowl provided

two executives
interest-free, non-secured $120,000 loan
so they could become members of an
exclusive golf club. (See Loans to/from
