What are 990s?
Annual report filed to the IRS by a non profit in lieu of a tax return.
Key contents include: revenues, expenses, assets and fund balances; statements about
activities and accomplishments; names of executives, board members and key
employees; salaries/compensations for the top five employees and top officers;
information about subsidiaries and affiliates; five highest paid contractors; statements
explaining the reasons for “public charity” or “private foundation” status.
Who files?
Most tax-exempt charities in U.S. file; many others nonprofits (one-third in all).
Exceptions – churches/religious nonprofits exempt from filing (some do so voluntarily),
also nonprofit businesses affiliated with churches are subject to file.
Until 2010, small nonprofits with gross receipts of $25k or less did not have to file. That
has changed under new rules (see below) for 2010.
990 variations:
-- 990 EZ -- Filed mostly by nonprofits with gross receipts/net assets less than $1million/
$2.5 million. (Form changes have moved threshold for using EZ to $200k receipts/$500k
assets)
-- 990 PFs – Variation filed by private foundations,
-- 990 Ts – schedules that detail any taxable revenues outside nonprofit’s core mission.
-- 990 Ns – e-filing for small nonprofits with gross receipts of $25,000 - $100,000
(largely did not have to file any forms prior to 2010)
Who files?
Most tax exempt charities in US file annual 990s, the report filed in lieu of an income tax
return. Many others nonprofits (one-third in all) also required to do so.
Exceptions – churches/religious nonprofits are not required to file. Some churches do so
voluntarily, also nonprofit businesses affiliated with churches are subject to file.
Until 2010, small nonprofits with gross receipts of $25k or less did not have to file. That
has changed under new rules (see below) for 2010.

--IRS Instructions for 990s http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i990.pdf
-- Independent Sector: An umbrella coalition targeting best practices for nonprofits.
Publishes journalist’s guide for covering nonprofits. http://www.independentsector.org/
-- Guidestar – FAQs http://www2.guidestar.org/rxg/help/faqs/form-990/index.aspx
-- Nonprofit Coordinating Committee of New York – has a great analysis of old (pre2008) 990 forms www.npccny.org/Form_990/990.htm.
Know your rights:
Under the “Taxpayer Bill of Rights,” 990s are public records, as are an organization’s
application for tax-exempt status (Forms 1023 and 1024) and the IRS Determination
Letter on an organization’s tax-exempt applications.
(See Taxpayer Bill of Rights II: http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/doc7394.pdf)
Once you request a 990, the IRS has 30 days to get documents to you.
Also, a non-profit must make their last three 990s available to you if you ask in person, or
within 30 days if you ask in writing.
Where to get 990s:
1. From the internet:
The premier online source for 990s is Guidestar, www.guidestar.com.
Free registration will get you the last three filings for nonprofits; the spendy “premium”
registration (several hundred dollars) will get you unlimited access (however many they
have). Great search functions include searching for nonprofits by name, keyword, city,
category, nonprofit type, income range.
If you don’t want to pay: Other online sites can be useful in obtaining free 990s going
back farther than what Guidestar may have. For instance, check out www.fdncenter.org.
2. From the IRS:
Fax 990 requests on media letterhead to IRS Ogden Service Center, 801-620-7896.
Include name and address of nonprofit and EIN (employee identification number) if
possible. (For copies of Forms 1023 or 1024, fax requests to the IRS Tax Exempt and
Government Entities Division, Cincinnati, 513-263-3434.)
3. From the nonprofit.
Under the tax code, tax exempt nonprofits must make available to the public its last three
990 filings. You can review these by going to the agency during normal business hours.
(Advantages – gathering first-hand information/observations about nonprofit. Example:
Seattle P-I investigation of King Co. Sheriff’s Office.)
Pitfalls, problems and limitations:
-- Snapshot of finances for one year only, without context.
-- Fraught with inaccuracies
-- Often incomplete – parts of forms, details often left out or blank.
-- Raw data can be bought, but needs to spot-checked against paper records (Hearst Boy
Scouts example)

Checking the data in 990s
If possible, try to compare 900s to audits, other available records
Check financial statements filed with state regulators (some states only)
Look for court filings by nonprofits, particularly bankruptcies.
Look at nonprofits websites – does the financial information match with 990 data?
Changes to Form 990:
The IRS introduced a major redesign of the IRS Form 990 for the 2009 filing period
(reporting year 2008). These are the first significant changest to the form since 1979.
.
Essentially, the old forms consisted 75 percent of financial information and 25 percent of
governance and operations. Under the new form, inverse is true: 75 percent of form is
governance and operations; 25 percent is financial.
Why the changes?
IRS focused on three primary areas:
 Enhancing transparency
 Promoting tax compliance
 Minimizing the burden on the filing organization.
Other reasons: explosion of nonprofits; inconsistency in reporting (defect of old form,
unstructured attachments, confusion in reporting instructions); recent nonprofit scandals
(United Way, Smithsonian) and Congressional inquiries, law changes.
Key changes:
-- Old 990s had nine pages in the core form and included two schedules (and up to 36
“unstructured” attachments.
-- New form has 11 pages in the core form and 15 schedules (several of them formerly in
attachments).
Other changes of note:
-- Compensation for top officers/employees need only disclose those making more than
$100,000 (Previously was $50,000).
-- Compensation also now focuses on salary (not expenses or benefits, unlike old forms)
-- Small nonprofits (with gross annual revenues of $25,000 or less) will now have to file
(previously were exempt from filing).
-- Disclosing “disqualified persons” – those in influential positions who were fired.
-- Conflict of interest and whistleblower policies are supposed to be reported.
-- Re-ordered form. Financial disclosures (mostly unchanged) dropped down farther into
report; signature block and summary brought up to first page.

What do changes mean for reporters?
 Changes in consistency for comparison:
Should look at least three for in-depth analysis – but do more if you can.
The changes make it difficult to do a line-by-line comparison because of re-ordering
of form; new information, etc.
 Still, basic information remains in tact – just need to find it.
Story ideas/what to look for when examining 990s:
 Look for major changes in revenues, expenses, assets – then try to determine why
those changes occurred? Financial problems? Hiding revenues/profiteering?
 Ratios: Public contributions vs. dependence on grants/loans.
Revenues going toward programs/services – how’s your charity stack up (talk to
experts)?
 Who are the board members? Is there turnover on board? (Politicians, prominent
community members, etc.) What influence do they have in organization? (MLK
examples-- councilman’s reasons for departure, nepotism by former politician)
 Comparing executive and employee compensation (in line with best practices?
(Talk to experts, various watchdog guidelines.)
 How has executive pay changed over time?
 Contracts – look at the highest contractors. Who’s getting them? Any connections
to board or staff (potential conflicts of interest, nepotism)?
