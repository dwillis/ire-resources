Bulletproofing your stories
Ziva Branstetter
Tulsa World enterprise editor

Is it a story in the first place?


Spend some time pre-reporting.



Bounce your theory off of the experts.
Look for real-world examples to back up your data. If you
can’t easily find anecdotal evidence to back up your story, it
might not be a story.

Build internal support for your project. Make sure
your top editors are on board. Talk with your editor
about how much time you will need, what resources
you need etc.
 What’s the minimum story and maximum story?

Provide a written project proposal and update your
editors regularly about your findings.


Before the story
Challenge the basis for key assumptions.
 Run your theory by experts, friends, family, critics.
 Create a chronology, either in text or spreadsheet
format, of each key event in your story. Link
documents to it.
 Track records requests. Which ones are outstanding?
What are the obstacles? What date did they promise
to give you the records? Take notes.
 On joint projects, create a common area in the
system for sharing files. Don’t have different versions
of the story or data. Google Docs; Evernote; Basecamp


Problem areas …
Conflicts of interest: Could anyone
possibly say you or your family have a
connection to the story?
 Axes to grind: Many sources have them.
But know what they are.
 Manage up: Prepare your bosses for
pushback, show key documents.
 Have clear ground rules about
undercover work or “posing”


Problem areas
Ask your source to sign a confidentiality
waiver over medical records etc.
 Truth checks: Ask about their background
and then match it up with the record.
 Background check – criminal, civil, social
networks etc. – any key figure, source etc.
 Vet anything you find through multiple
sources. It may be an official looking web
site but it may be a hoax.


Problem areas


Watch your tone
All communications must be professional,
neutral. Assume any communication could
be published.
 Voice mails, emails, social network
comments can come back to haunt you.




Partnerships


Make sure you clearly understand what is
being published with your name on it.

Checking facts
Before you publish, check every verifiable
fact.
 Retrace your steps. How did you get each
piece of key information? Can you document
it?
 Make sure everyone in the story has had a
chance to comment or take issue with your
reporting. Can’t reach someone? Send a
letter, knock on the door.
 Don’t be rushed into a story. Hold it if you
aren’t sure.


Checking facts
Ask people to read your story who aren’t
familiar with it. What questions do they have?
 Don’t worry about being a pest. Call back as
many times as you need to. Read back
quotes that could be misinterpreted.
 Don’t wait until the end to do key interviews.
 Be willing to send questions in advance if
needed.


Checking facts
Find reports to compare your findings to.
Have other people come up with the same
answers?
 Send key findings – the hardest-hitting stuff –
to all sources for reaction before story runs.
 No key point in your story should be a
surprise.
 Find an outside expert to review your
methodology, analysis.
 Consider letting people read / view an
advance copy but have clear ground rules.


Documenting your work
Save recordings of key interviews.
 Have a system with your notes. Inconsistency
is a problem.
 Keep a record of how many times you tried to
reach someone and in what way.
 You should seek comment from all parties,
even those you think won’t talk.


Writing investigative stories


The rolling investigation
Go with your strongest angle. Keep working on
the follow-ups.
 Write what you don’t know as well as what you
know. People are often motivated to help you fill
in the blanks.
 Be neutral when possible: “Did not return calls”
sounds worse than “Could not be reached.” How
hard did you really try?
 Go back and publish a recap story that connects
all of the dots for readers.


Writing investigative stories
Write with authority but be clear where key
info came from;
 Is the document authentic? Get it from the
source, not a summary or news clip.
 Post pdfs of key documents, data, links to
websites online.
 Be honest with your readers about limitations
of the story.




“What the records do not show is XYZ …”

Writing investigative stories
Look for the grey not just black and white.
 MAKE SURE YOU REVIEW ALL DOCUMENTS
BEFORE PUTTING THEM ONLINE.
 Social security numbers
 Home addresses
 Info on unrelated parties.
 Don’t build a case for removal of public
records.


Breaking news
Scanner traffic: Be very careful.
 Don’t just write over the mistake.
Aggregators can pick it up.




“Despite initial reports …”

Confirm deaths from multiple sources
 Understate death tolls and damage
estimates.
 Have a BN plan.


Breaking news
Read the comments and pay attention
to complaints about errors.
 Twitter contains lots of wrong stuff!
 Have a policy about using photos /
posts from Facebook and other social
networking sites.




If you use it, don’t say it was from John
Smith’s FB. Say it’s from someone who
identified himself as John Smith.

Corrections
Don’t hide from corrections. Own up to
mistakes quickly and thoroughly.
 Run the correction by the source to ensure it
addresses the mistake.
 Retractions / corrections / clarifications
 A follow up doesn’t equal a correction.
 If you wrote the story about the charge, be
willing to write the story about charges being
dropped.


Corrections
A small mistake (wrong age, date) can lead
to a correction and allow people to question
the integrity of the whole story.
 Sometimes people are wrong about their own
info.
 CQ phone numbers, URLs, addresses, dates
etc.
 Track patterns in corrections.




Same source? Same type of error? Same
department?

Avoiding lawsuits


Understand libel and the elements required:

False statement that identifies someone and
harms them.
 Plaintiffs must prove you were negligent (for
private individuals) or acted with actual malice (for
public officials).




Privileged documents and statements:

Court testimony, police reports, government
documents – must give fair and accurate report.
 Some public documents are still not “privileged”


Avoiding lawsuits
False light. Be careful when
repurposing old photos, video, reusing
old quotes.
 If you have to choose, it’s better to be
right than first.
 Stay current on media law cases so you
know where the land mines are.
