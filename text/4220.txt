This Won’t Hurt a Bit
Tips for researching origins of a medical
device

Brigham and Women’s Hospital/ the doctor’s notes for Amy Reed
9/4/2013: “This is clearly a benign diagnosis
10/30/2013: “Unfortunately and very unexpectedly, final pathology
revealed” a uterine sarcoma
“I talked about how the procedure of morcellation may modify the natural
history of the disease, increasing the probability” of the cancer spreading

Is this field doing something odd?
Inderbir Gill, chairman of urology at USC
School of Medicine: “I am totally blown away
that they were just whacking away in the
abdomen, not in a confined space.”
Dana Portenier, chief, general surgery Duke: “It
just seems like gross irresponsibility.”

Check patent filings
1990: Patent filing for protective surgical bag
described risk that morcellating cancer could
spread the disease
2000: J&J patent for a strong specimen bag.
Cutting malignant tissue “can lead to the
seeding and re-spreading of cancer.”

Did they use bag? Talk to the
trainers
www.orlive.com; J& J own website
Dr. Steven McCarus: J & J consultant: “If you don’t want to
spread things or don’t want to drop things, ideally you put it
in a bag. It’s a common sense thing to do.”
BUT, “We don’t use them. I don’t know of a good bag that
is available to do morcellation of the uterus.

Search SEC.gov for early evangelizers
FemRx’s David Olive, gynecologist, told us
docs would “lose” tissue: “Things get buried in
the bowel and spleen and stomach. It’s not like
you can turn the patient upside down and
shake them. Eventually people started leaving
little bits.”

Medical conference buzz
At Society for Gynecologic Oncologist
conference 2011: Korean study showed that for
women whose tumors removed intact, 19%
died within 63 months, 44% with morcellated
tumors died within 39 months.
Mayo Clinic doctor: “I don’t think there is an
acceptable safe morcellator out there.”
