 Law presumes records are open unless

otherwise closed
 Agencies generally have a duty to redact
 What is a record?
◦ “all documents, papers, letters, maps, books,
photographs, microfilms, electronic data processing
files and output, films, sound recordings or other
material, regardless of physical form or
characteristics, made or received pursuant to law or
ordinance or in connection with the transaction of
official business by any governmental agency.”

 Makes computer software exempt from

disclosure but not the data
 Records custodian “shall promptly make
available for inspection any public record not
specifically exempt from disclosure.”
 Within 7 days, must either:
◦ Provide the record
◦ Deny in writing, stating the basis
◦ Furnish form w/ time estimate to comply

Failure to respond is a denial.
 Agencies not required to create records

 Agencies are required to redact exempt

material, provide the rest.
 Public bodies can’t give otherwise public
records to a private contractor and deny
access.

 Payrolls, including employees’ names, titles,

hire date, salary;
 Budgets in electronic format. Compile
several years’ worth and see changes over
time;
 Emails related to any topic you are writing
about. From official address AND personal
address if covered by law;
 Personnel actions;
 Tort claims and lawsuits, including
settlement payments;

 The whole packet that board members or

councilors get, not just the agenda;
 Minutes of meetings, agendas;

community … nursing homes, day-care
centers, hospitals, jails etc.;
