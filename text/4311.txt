Roll Your Own Database
Hand data entry and data scraping as
tools for getting stories.

Key Considerations for Hand Entry
• Is the story worth the effort?

• Not all databases need be multi-thousand row
monsters that drive a major project. They can
be small, quickly entered jobs that add heft to
a story, or even drive a story.

Key Data Sources
• From public records on your beat
• Archival records that have never found their
way into a database
• Reports that were generated electronically,
but for which the source data no longer exist.
• From confidential sources

Scraping
Some key questions are same as for hand entry:
- Is the story worth the effort?
- Do you have the time and resources?

Other important considerations
• Use the simplest tool for the job. Why scrape
with a programming script if you can do it with
a lightweight command line tool (e.g., wget
and cURL)?

• Grab a few samples of the target data and
assess them for parse-ability *before*
investing time in a complex, time-consuming
scrape. (Badly formed HTML makes life hell.)

Data from scratch: When data don't exist.
You've got a great story idea but no one
tracks the data. Time to quit, right? Wrong.
We'll show you the tools, and the pitfalls, of
making your own data when no data exists.

documents (DGA), they start publishing “very noisy” and
“very empty” (+100) documents

Side Effects: Much more noisy docs

PriceCheck
A community-created guide to health costs

The problem
Insurers negotiate with providers to determine
how much they’ll pay for common procedures.
These contracts are sealed.

The problem
Insurers negotiate with providers to determine
how much they’ll pay for common procedures.
These contracts are sealed.
Unless you’re a patient.

PriceCheck mission
● With a Knight Prototype Grant KQED, KPCC
and ClearHealthCosts.com teamed up.
● Would users submit their health care
information?

YES
Hundreds of users
are submitting.

YES
Thousands more
are searching.

Just enough data
We didn’t need the whole data set, just enough
to make apples-to-apples comparisons.
● Reported on costs pre-launch,
● Surveyed local providers on costs,
● Focused early asks by geography and
procedure.

We found wide price disparities
Back MRI $255 or $3,700?
Mammogram $134 or $1,200?
X-Ray $20 or $988?
IUD $55 or $2,600?

Our community speaks
“This is outrageous.”
“Found out I could have had it done for half
the price only blocks away. ”
“I was going to be billed $830 through my
PPO for an MRI. The cash price? $500."

Impact
Insurers: Anthem Blue Cross cites PriceCheck
data in Stanford contract fight, affecting 10,000
people.
Doctors: Providers now want to share their
data, we are currently speaking with several
groups, including the California Radiological
Society.

Impact
Media: Articles in the Journal of the American
Medical Association and the New England
Journal of Medicine and Harvard Business
Review.
Coverage in Politico, The Washington Post,
Association of Health Care Journalists, The
Health Care Blog and others.
Expansion: Launched at WHYY in February

Partnership
Three teams, five locales? No problem!
Create a lean team with clear roles
Basecamp + Skype

User testing
Online testing,
speak aloud testing,
iterate,
try again.

What we learned: Clean data
Do the hard work for the user.
Autocomplete for
procedures.
Google Places for
providers.

What we learned: Clean data
Surveyed providers for comparison points.
Always collect contact information because
sometimes $3592.50 is $359.25.
Question? Contact the user.
When in real doubt, remove the data.

What we learned: Audience
Consistently engage the audience on all platforms.

What we learned: Audience
People submit more after hearing a personal
story. But we need data to build a story.
1. Social media and on-air callouts.
2. Reach out to existing audiences.
3. Push one ask at a time.

The future
Invest more time in engaging with the audience
and stakeholders.
Improve the feedback loop to strengthen
community engagement.
Add features informed by user feedback.
