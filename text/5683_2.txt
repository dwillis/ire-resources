GUN THEFT AND CRIME

Statistics
●
●
●

Between 2007 and 2016, at least 1.83 million guns were reported stolen in the
U.S. (FBI)
The vast majority of these guns were NOT stolen out of gun stores
In 2016….
○
○

There were nearly 9,300 guns stolen out of gun stores
That amounted to less than 4 percent of all the reported guns stolen

What happens to guns after they are stolen?

You can answer that question with data…..

Missing Pieces
●

The Trace and NBC obtained data that reflected gun records from more than
1,000 law enforcement agencies spread across 36 states.

●

Using that data, we identified about 23,000 stolen guns that were recovered
by law enforcement during an investigation.

●

We released all the data on The Trace’s website at
thetrace.org/missing-pieces

What data do I need?
●
●

Data that contains the serial number, make, and other identifying and case
information on guns reported stolen
Data that contains the same information for guns that were seized,
confiscated, recovered, etc. from suspected offenders, or otherwise came
under the custody and control of the local PD.

Public Records Requests
Common reasons for denial:
●

“We’re simply not capable” or “doing so would constitute creation of a new
record”
○

●

Serial numbers are protected law enforcement investigatory material
○

●

Make sure that’s true (policy handbook, evidence techs, crime analysts)
Ask how, and point out that serial numbers have been released by other agencies in their
state, and are typically contained in court documents.

Serial numbers are “private” information
○

Argue that serial numbers are assigned to property, not individuals

There are two ways to identify stolen guns that were
used in crimes
●

Find serial number/make matches
○

Serial numbers are not unique, but must be used in conjunction with the make, or another
piece of identifying information

1996: The Dickey Amendment prevents the CDC from collecting gun data for
the purposes of gun control advocacy. Today, we have very little national data
on gun injuries and gun violence.
2004: Congress allows the 10-year-old national ban on assault weapons to
expire.
2005: Congress passes the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act,
which protects gun companies from most liability suits when guns are used in
crimes.
2006: A NY private equity fund buys Bushmaster, the first of a dozen gun
company purchases, and combines them into the Remington Outdoor
Company.
