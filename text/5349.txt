Not every good story would make a good podcast. Look for stories that have broader
significance nationally or internationally. Why does your story matter and what are the
stakes?
Plan for your ideal project, but be willing to scale back. Once the news starts moving,
you’ll be struggling to keep up.
Preserve incidental audio that normally doesn’t make the cut in a radio story. It gives
listeners information that direct quotes sometimes don’t, making the story feel real and
setting the scene.
Have a system for labelling and organizing your audio so it’s accessible and you can
easily trace its source.
Remember the visceral nature of audio. Just because it’s a sensational or raw recording
doesn’t mean you should use it. Treat sources with respect.
Ask for help from journalists and podcasters near and far. Listening sessions are your
friends.
Don’t be afraid to tell a story. A long-form audio piece needs a narrative structure that
keeps the listener's attention while still giving accurate information. Storytelling is an ally
of journalism, not an adversary.
Keep the narrative straightforward. Listeners only get one chance to understand what
you’re talking about.
Be honest with your listeners. Don’t play dumb as a narrative device.
Have a formal process for fact-checking. It will prevent you from publishing any
inaccuracies (of course) but also help streamline the story.
Don’t try to sound like someone other than yourself. It’s OK to talk like a real person, with
all the quirks that sometimes entails.
Let data guide reporting, but be aware that it’s hard for listeners to absorb too many
numbers, so use numbers sparingly. Focus instead on what the numbers mean.
