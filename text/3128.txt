PRESENTATION STARTS AT THE BEGINNING
It can’t be an afterthought to the project and it’s got to be on everybody’s
radar all the time. Reporters, photographers, designers, graphic artists and all the
editors should be assigned and on board from the beginning.
A TEAM EFFORT
And everyone needs to be treated equally. Reporters, photographers,
artists, designers are all journalists.
PLAY TO STRENGTHS
When we were looking into the Seminole tribe of Florida, early on we
chose a feature writer and feature photographer, both of whom were nonthreatening and sensitive and we knew that left to their own devices they would
come back with the goods. They did.
PUT FACES ON THE NUMBERS.
Think beyond the database to the people the numbers represent. A
television station reporter crunched the pistol permit numbers in their state last
year and came up with how many gun licensees lived where and the most
popular first names of the permit holders. Megan O’Matz and John Maines
crunched the Florida numbers, they wanted to know: Who are these guys? So
they compared the identities of 443,425 license holders with databases of felony
convictions, domestic violence injunctions, arrests, warrants, clemency
proceedings, jail bookings and sex offender registries. They also analyzed
21,180 disciplinary actions the Florida Division of Licensing has taken against
permit holders. And then they went and found victims.
LET THE REPORTERS REPORT, THE PHOTOGRAPHERS PHOTOGRAPH
AND THE DESIGNERS DESIGN.
