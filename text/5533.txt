“Cast your beat broadly -- cultivate sources and
look for stories beyond the accepted sources of
power and authority.”
-- Paige St. John, “The Beat Investigation”

Finding sources
▶ Organizational charts
▶ Internal contact lists
▶ Public salary databases
Go back a few years

Build your network
▶ Look for a sherpa
▶ Ask trusted sources introduce you to other
trusted sources
▶ Find the watering holes (where do they meet
to talk frankly?)
▶ Find the “formers”

Other tips
▶ Not sure about a source’s correct email? BCC
all possible options
▶ Do some research before cold-calling a source
-- find some common ground
