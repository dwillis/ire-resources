Common UltraEdit Commands

Find (Control-F or Alt-F3): UE’s Find command has several features that most text editors or
word processors don’t. Perhaps the most important is the first check box, labeled “List Lines
Containing String”, which will do exactly that – retrieve each full line in which your search
criteria is found. This may not sound like much on paper, but give it a try and you’ll see how
powerful this can be. Once you have a list of lines, you can double-click on any line in the
smaller box and it will take you to that line in the full file. Very useful for spot editing and
checking. You can also click the “Clipboard” button and it will copy the contents of the smaller
box – all the lines that contain your search terms – onto the Clipboard, meaning you can paste
them into another file.
Replace (Control-R): UE has all the features you’d expect from a search and replace command,
but it adds a few more, too. Radio buttons allow you to perform the replace within highlighted
text or across all open files in UltraEdit, in addition to the currently open file. You can also tell it
to match only whole words or be case-sensitive.
Regular Expressions (used in Find or Replace): Regular expressions are powerful tools that can
help you perform only the find or replace commands that you exactly want, thus not ruining your
file in order to use it. UE supports traditional Unix regular expression syntax, but you may want
to start out using the regexp syntax that comes with UltraEdit:
Symbol Function
% Matches the start of line - Indicates the search string must be at the beginning of a line
but does not include any line terminator characters in the resulting string selected.
$ Matches the end of line - Indicates the search string must be at the end of line but does
not include any line terminator characters in the resulting string selected.
? Matches any single character except newline
* Matches any number of occurrences of any character except newline
+ Matches one or more of the preceding character/expression. At least one occurrence of
the character must be found. Does not match repeated newlines.
++ Matches the preceding character/expression zero or more times. Does not match repeated
newlines.
^b Matches a page break
^p Matches a newline (CR/LF) (paragraph) (DOS Files)
^r Matches a newline (CR Only) (paragraph) (MAC Files)
^n Matches a newline (LF Only) (paragraph) (UNIX Files)
^t Matches a tab character
[ ] Matches any single character, or range in the brackets
^{A^}^{B^}
Matches expression A OR B
^ Overrides the following regular expression character
^(…^)
Brackets or tags an expression to use in the replace command. A regular
expression may have up to 9 tagged expressions, numbered according to their order in the

regular expression.The corresponding replacement expression is ^x, for x in the range 1-9.
Example: If ^(h*o^) ^(f*s^) matches "hello folks", ^2 ^1 would replace it with "folks hello".
