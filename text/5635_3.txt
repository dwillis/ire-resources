Get the data, get the
story!

Census and other government data can help you ﬁnd
the immigration stories in your areas -- a selection of
stories easy to customize for your town!
Some recurring favorites:
--Border crossings to show very recent trends in how
many are coming as unauthorized from south of the
border with Mexico
--Estimates of annual immigration to each county
(nothing about countries of legal/illegal status)
--Newest immigrants (here a year or less) by state
and birth country from American Community Survey
microdata
--Workforce data showing pay
--FOIA for administrative records

Border crossings

Bring home the border crossing story
●

How many unaccompanied children are coming to host families in your state or county?

●

What’s changing right now? Find the local agencies, usually immigrant advocates, who are contracted
to recruit host families for children. Are they having trouble recruiting families because of new rules
allowing ICE to investigate and deport host family members?

●

Why are children fleeing? Hear their stories in your state’s version of family court -- Special Immigrant
Juvenile Status hearings are open and on the record and children testify about conditions in the home
country that prompted them to leave
Some states are friendlier than others in this process; check state legislation for laws that may extend
parental custody to 21 for this purpose -- it allows the status for older youth.

US Census Estimates estimate annual immigration (International Migration) as one of the
components of population change along with births, deaths and moving within the country.
