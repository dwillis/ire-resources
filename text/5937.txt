Tips for stories on surprise medical bills:

 Patients, patients, patients. Find the patients who are suffering as a result of this. Many will be happy to
talk to you.

 Consider crowdsourcing. We started showusyourbills@9news.com in 2015 and, to date, we have
received more than 1,600 submissions. Put out calls for patients on Facebook or Twitter.

 Must know how to read an EOB and understand that charges are NOT what patients typically end up
paying. Here is a good place to start: https://www.fairhealthconsumer.org/insurance-basics/your-bill

 Half of all states do NOT protect patients in any substantive way. Here is a good place to start to find out
about your state: https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2019/state-efforts-protect-consumersbalance-billing

 Legislators have becoming increasingly savvy to this issue, but most are woefully ill-prepared to
understand the root of the problem. Find the expert on this subject in your state legislature and press
him/her as to why your state hasn’t passed comprehensive protections.

 There is NO federal law on the issue of surprise/balance billing. Congress is seriously considering
legislation this year. President appears in favor of doing something. But the lack of federal protection
keeps most of us unprotected, even if we live in a state that has passed legislation (google ERISA to better
understand why).

 State attorneys general are increasingly considering flexing their muscles here. Ask your AG what your
state is considering doing to protect patients.

 Most of the pushback comes from physicians and hospitals. Don’t be afraid to demand interviews with
your state’s hospital association and/or medical society.

 Use claims databases like https://www.fairhealthconsumer.org/ to establish reasonable payment
schedules

Covering Sins of the Church
There are 197 Catholic dioceses in the United States. Only 127 have released lists of clergy
“credibly accused” of child sexual abuse. There are stories to be done both before and after
your diocese releases its list:
Before the list is released:


Tell survivor stories. Many have waited years, even decades for the Church to
acknowledge their abusive priest.



Find them through http://bishopaccountability.org/, SNAP (Survivors Network of Those
Abused by Priests) or lawsuits (county and federal). Search for keywords: father,
reverend, Rev., Catholic, church, roman, diocese, archdiocese, bishop, Jane Doe (as
plaintiff), John Doe (as plaintiff)



Find your diocese annual directories and scan. Also find access to the Official Catholic
Directory (local library or university library) which contains assignment histories of ALL
priests in the United States. Start building a database of priests potentially on your
diocesan list to be released.

After the list is released:


How transparent is it? Are the number of victim/survivors listed? The year(s) of the
abuse? The parish(es) where it occurred? A summary of the abuse? Find the gaps and
point them out (utilizing the data you have already compiled from above), plus you have
collected lawsuits which often provide great detail about the abuse.



Where priests shuffled around? This is where your directories come in handy. You have
a priest’s assignment history, so now you can see if he hopscotched from parish to
parish (likely to keep the faithful in the dark about his abuse).



Look for credibly accused priests in other dioceses NOT named on your diocesan list.
Why? Some dioceses only list priests where abuse occurred within its geographic
boundaries. But again, the shuffle game comes into play. We found a priest with a
sordid past in Fort Worth, TX, who later served in Houston parishes for a dozen years,
and never appeared on the Houston credibly accused list.



Where are they now? Check out Facebook and Twitter. You’ll be surprised at the lives
accused priests are living now. We found one having a good ol’ time playing keyboard at
local bars in jazz bands, and another swimming with dolphins on his 25 th Caribbean
cruise.

Turning a GA Story into an Investigation
1) Pay attention to daily news (go to the am meetings, watch the newscasts, talk to the

desk often)

2) Read ALL the comments (Facebook & Twitter)

3) Trust your gut

4) Sell the idea for a deeper dive to your manager(s) with examples

5) When data doesn’t tell the story get out there

Bonus Tip
** When everything goes wrong start over **
