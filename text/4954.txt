What is a
flythrough?

Video: BBC News coverage of Paris attacks
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34824435

Why use flythroughs in visual storytelling?
• Quick, easy way to produce a visual story
• Good way to show a progression of events over time
• Help people to locate themselves in an unfamiliar place
• High quality satellite imagery
• Cheaper than drone footage
• Can form the basis for something more complex

How are they being used?
• BBC News – Paris attacks coverage
