Social Search Tips: Facebook
Use a cocktail of sources combined with social media sites, like public records,
web searches, Spokeo, etc. The following variables may be searchable for
someone on Facebook, and you can apply them to finding people on other social
platforms, or anywhere:
● name, hometown, phone, email, username, current and past employment,
aliases, family members, friends, birthday, posts, photos, groups, likes, current
and previous residence, schools attended, sexual preference, gender,
relationship, anniversary, languages, places visited, events attended or plan to
attend, networks

● Use the site operator site:facebook.com (add keywords, or names)

Access to Closed Groups: Message or Friend the Admins

When Friends are Hidden
● If the person’s Friends list is not visible, you can often still see who has
commented on (or liked) profile pictures, etc.
