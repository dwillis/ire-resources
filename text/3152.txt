Investigating Public Health Agencies & Programs
Performance in a crisis (or during a drill)
When called to respond to a major public health event, how well did your local or state health
department perform? Such events can include illness outbreaks, contact tracing of people exposed to
an infectious person, floods, hurricanes and other disasters.
Most agencies use some kind of “after-action” report to assess their own performance – after
an event or a drill. The emails and other correspondence of government employees involved in the
event also can provide insight. Make sure to get a copy of the official agency plan for handling such
an event: Was it followed? Most state health departments have conducted drills for such things as
pandemic influenza and emergency/bioterrorism preparedness.
Notifiable diseases
Certain diseases are required by law to be reported to your state health department. Are local
doctors, hospitals and laboratories filing required reports – and are they filing them as quickly as
they’re supposed to? Despite such reports being critical to quickly identifying outbreaks and
preventing the spread of disease, they often are filed late – and sometimes not at all.
• State notifiable disease databases contain information such as: Disease, date of onset,
date of report to health department, whether the person died or was hospitalized, date of
death, county of person’s residence, name of hospital where treated.
• Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s MMWR (Morbidity and Mortality Weekly
Report), released Thursdays. http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/ Reporters can get on a list to
receive an embargoed copy early Thursday morning by contacting CDC’s press office.
Tallies number of new cases reported by state health departments to CDC in the previous
week and cumulatively. Provides comparison stats for the previous year.
• State/county death certificate databases. Can be helpful in identifying people who died
of specific diseases.
• Disease support group web sites, local medical associations/specialty associations.
Money
Just as there are great stories in how City Hall spends taxpayer money, there are plenty of
watchdog opportunities examining the fiscal activities of local and state health departments. What’s
the public getting for its money?
• Tobacco settlement funds. What is your state doing with this windfall of cash? Is it going
toward tobacco prevention – or things that have nothing to do with public health? How
does the amount of money your state spends on tobacco prevention programs compare
with what the CDC recommends?

index.htm
•

Funding disparities. Is your state being shortchanged in the amount of federal public
health funds it receives? Why? Is it applying for everything it could? An annual report
compiled by the Trust for America’s Health is a great starting point for this research:

•

Bioterrorism funds. After 9/11 and the anthrax attacks, the federal government boosted
its efforts to increase the ability of state and local health departments to respond to a
bioterrorism attack. While many news organizations have written about funds the U.S.

Department of Homeland Security has given to local police and fire departments, few have
examined what local health departments have done with a separate pool of money
distributed by the CDC. Many states aren’t spending the money they’ve been given,
according to this HHS Inspector General’s report:
http://www.oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region5/50500031.pdf CDC recently evaluated each
state on its emergency/bioterrorism preparedness:

•

Assess individual programs. How effective are public health programs in your
community? Some areas to look at: STD and TB control, lead poisoning prevention,
obesity, anti-smoking youth programs, teen pregnancy and HIV prevention, pandemic flu
preparedness, dental health, immunizations. Is a government entity running the programs?
Or is it a nonprofit? What have they accomplished? Periodic reports usually are required
from the program operator to the funding source. Look for reports not just at the local level,
but also from the local level to the state and from the state to CDC or another federal
agency. The HHS Inspector General has cited CDC for funding HIV/AIDS groups even
though they have reported few accomplishments or their performance was considered
“abysmal.” http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region4/40308011.pdf

•

Examine lab safety and competence. Is your state health department’s laboratory
capable of quickly and accurately identifying key pathogens? Are local private and
university laboratories following safety procedures and keeping dangerous germs secure?
Look at the handling of potential bioterrorism agents, called “select agents.” An HHS
Inspector General’s review of a small sampling of labs found security issues:
http://www.oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region4/40601033.pdf. Look for drills and tests of
your local labs – hundreds of lab workers nationally were potentially exposed to a
weakened strain of a bioterrorism agent when samples were routinely mishandled during a
recent national readiness test. Were labs in your state among them?

•

Investigate lab animal welfare. Labs receiving U.S. Public Health Service funds agree to
follow certain animal welfare rules and the National Institutes of Health Office of Laboratory
Animal Welfare monitors compliance: http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/ . Other oversight
organizations: AAALAC (a private group, but their reports would be public if filed with a
state agency or public university), USDA. Look for reports from the lab’s Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee, which would investigate animal welfare complaints and
violations of approved research protocols.
