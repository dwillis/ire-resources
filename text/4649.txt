What is Autotune?

A centralized management system for
interactive storytelling elements.
quizzes, charts, image sliders, tables, etc.

Background
●

launched June 2015

●

open source

●

in active development

●

maintained by Vox Product’s Storytelling Tools team

●

https://github.com/voxmedia/autotune

How does it work?

Terminology
●

Blueprint - Autotune-friendly tool templates.

●

Project - Instance of a blueprint + data

●

Theme - Colors, fonts etc.

Workflow

Workflow
●

Blueprints are git repos with extra info
○

Required inputs

○

How to build it

●

Built projects deployed to Amazon S3

●

Resque and Redis used to keep track of async builds and syncs.

Data
Model

Why Autotune?

Unified destination for creating projects and
collaborating on tools.
Editorial users

Developers

●

clearly defined place to find out what
tools are available

●

one location for developing and
maintaining tools

●

identical project creation process for all
tools

●

easy to find project and provide
assistance should the need arise

●

easily able to access the project at a later
date should the need arise

Scalability
●

A blueprint can create an infinite number of projects

●

All projects are version controlled

●

Discover a bug? Fix it once and only once.
○

After upgrading the blueprint in Autotune to include the bug fix, any number of previously
created projects can upgraded to use this newer version of the blueprint.

Ease of use
●

Standardized process for creating, publishing, and embedding projects

●

Fast and easy for editorial users to update and preview projects (that are
live preview enabled)

●

Eradicates need for copy and pasting custom CSS & HTML into articles
since all projects are embedded using iframes

●

Embed code never changes - even if the project is republished, the embed
code will remain the same

What’s next for Autotune?

More open source blueprints
Image slider and headline generator are currently the only existing open source
blueprints for Autotune
We want to change that.

Autotune features
WYSIWYG editing
●

Builds on the recently added live preview
ability

●

●

Built in themes
●

Supplemental to or in replacement of the
current form UI for creating & editing
projects

Currently theme list is baked into
Autotune; Blueprint provides
implementation

●

Change to built-in-themes

●

Define styles once. Use with any blueprint

Will allow for greater customization in
projects (e.g. adding annotations to
points on line charts)

●

Make it easy to create open source
blueprints
