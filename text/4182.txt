Lessons from the field (and off): Covering the NFL and its intersection with local governments
The Statistics Are Clear: Sports Stadiums are Money Losers for Cities

85 percent of economists agree that local governments should eliminate subsidies to
professional sports franchises.1
Taxpayers contribute an average of 75 percent to build and operate new professional sports
stadiums and arenas in North America.
Taxpayers have helped finance every new or every major renovation of NFL stadiums.
Only 20 percent of public facility owners are making money on their leases with pro sports
franchises.2
Los Angeles is the NFL’s ultimate leverage. If any team has had a problem getting a city to pony
up for a new/renovated stadium, the going-to-LA rumor pops up.3

What Can You Do As a Reporter?

Counter all rosy, team-funded economic studies with facts and independent experts. The team
or the city will put out a study that claims an economic bonanza from having a new stadium.
These studies typically ignore three economic facts. Substitution effect. (Money spent on
stadiums could be directed elsewhere.) Crowding out. (Sports tourists tend to make other
tourists go away.) Leakages. (Not all money spent on sports stays in the area. Athletes/owners
could live out of town, for instance.)4
Find all the costs. Many ways stadium deals cost the public money are hidden. Some examples:
Bond debt on new stadiums, bond debt on old stadiums5, police costs, fire costs,
redevelopment money, land, transportation infrastructure, stadium operations6, stadium
maintenance, state-of-the-art clauses7, cost overruns on construction, foregone property taxes
for stadiums on public land.8
Change the conversation. Don’t think about stadium deals in terms of economic benefit.
Instead, think about them in terms of the financial risk to the public. Report out the financial
worst-case scenario and understand which costs are fixed and which might change depending
on the economy, etc.
Follow the news. The Field of Schemes website (http://www.fieldofschemes.com/) and Twitter
feed (@fieldofschemes) have daily updates on stadium deals across the country.
