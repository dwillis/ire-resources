RSS Feeds:
Many government and private web sites offer RSS feeds to automatically alert you when they
issue reports, press releases, articles, blog items or other posts. You can view the feeds using
a free RSS Reader such as The Old Reader, Blogtrottr, or Feedly.
Example of RSS Feed:
Federal Elections Commission
http://www.fec.gov/rss/RSSFeeds.shtml
Massachusetts State Audits
http://www.mass.gov/auditor/recent-audits.html
Alternatives (email lists, Twitter):
Many government web sites also use mailing lists or other ways to sign up to receive news
alerts. It is worth checking to see whether any agencies you care about offer email lists and sign
up.
Examples include:
* Boston emergency alerts
http://www.cityofboston.gov/oem/alertboston.asp
* FDA news
http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/ContactFDA/StayInformed/GetEmailUpdates/ucm2005606.htm
In addition, many government sites are increasingly breaking news on Twitter first, rather than
with a traditional press release. The Department of Justice maintains a list of US Attorney
Twitter accounts across the country: https://twitter.com/TheJusticeDept/lists/u-s-attorneys-ontwitter/members
Monitor web sites:

If sites don’t offer an RSS feed or email list, you can use a tool to automatically check for
updates on the web site. (One caveat: You will likely get alerts even when minor changes are
made to web sites -- not just a new info you care about.)
Examples:
● Firefox plugins: SiteDelta & Distill Monitor
● Chrome monitor: Page Monitor
● Several web sites will send email alerts, including: changedetection.com,
www.followthatpage.com, and watchthatpage.com

Advanced alert services:
Some web sites allow you create customized alerts when new items are added. Some
examples include:
● SEC filings. Several sites allow you to receive alerts when companies file new SEC
filings that match your criteria, including secfilings.com (free) and Morningstar Document
Research ($802/yr.).
● Election/legislative information. The Sunlight Foundation has developed some
tools to send out alerts on election filings, legislative bills...etc. Check out https://
scout.sunlightfoundation.com/ & http://realtime.influenceexplorer.com/alerts/
● Google Alerts. You can have Google email links whenever it finds new articles either in
its news search or more general newsfeed Web search. You can set the alerts to either
alert you “as it happens,” once a day or once a week. https://www.google.com/alerts

In-house tools:
Many newsrooms have built their own specialized programs to automatically check web sites
and send story tips to reporters, such as:

The Lens has built a variety of tools to alert reporters (and provide information for
its web site) when government agencies add new records to their public databases.
For instance, it monitors local government contracts and real estate transactions.
vault.thelensnola.org/
The Boston Globe built a tool that scrapes the state court web site several times a day,
checks for new criminal and civil filings, and sends an email to reporters summarizing
any new cases
The Marshall Project built an internal news app called "Klaxon" that automatically
checks several web pages, such as the Department of Justice site, for changes .
The Montreal Gazette uses a tool to send out alerts when readers add data to a Google
form (in a crowdsourced project) or their local data portal adds new databases
The Baltimore Sun used tools to scrape court appeals decisions in Maryland and grab
forfeiture items from Justia.com's RSS feeds and post them on Twitter and send alerts to
reporters.

A Propublica reporter scrapes lobbying reports, adds data to a Google spreadsheet and
issues news alerts.
The St. Louis Post-Dispatch built several scrapers to generate story leads. One checks
911 calls every 15 minutes for shootings, suspicious deaths and other high-profile event
and emails reports. Another checks Pacer RSS feeds for new filings in specific cases. A
third scraper checks a state campaign finance site for donations of $5,000 or more.
