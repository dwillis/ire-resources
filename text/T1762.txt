Boise home to some of Idaho’s richest, poorest

The richest and nearly the poorest neighborhoods in Idaho can be found within the Boise city
limits. The large homes of the Boise Foothills represent the area with the highest median income in the
state. The runoff from those manicured lawns trickles down to the Boise River, which bounds the
opposite end of the income spectrum — the neighborhood that includes downtown and the River Street
area. Includes a list of Idaho’s richest and poorest cities.
‘Stepchild’ area fights blight

In the shadows of the grand football palace known as Invesco Field at Mile High, and just west of
Interstate 25, lies a sliver of a community called Sun Valley. It is by far and away metro Denver's poorest
neighborhood, a stultifying blend of blight, crime and impoverishment.
Every day, about 300,000 cars pass within a stone's throw of the neighborhood. Few in those
autos know Sun Valley exists, except as a shortcut to work or cheap parking for Broncos games.
Sun Valley's annual median household income is about $7,500, according to the latest census
figures. That's about a fourth of the Denver metro average and an astonishing $10,000 lower than the
region's next-poorest neighborhood.
Grandparents’ rights under review

What makes Ginny Barton different from a foster parent? Nothing, she says, except that foster
parents receive government financial support for raising children who are not theirs. Barton, who is
raising three of her grandchildren, does receive some assistance, but she said it isn't enough to cover the
costs.
Unlike some states, Virginia does not provide money -- called guardian subsidies -- to
grandparents who take responsibility for their grandchildren when the parent is unable to do so. Subsidies
are one of several changes that grandparent advocates would like to see in Virginia. With first-time data
on grandparents released by the Census Bureau this spring -- and with the resulting media coverage -many are using the attention to ask lawmakers to rethink how to best serve those who unexpectedly
become parents again.
Searchlight in dark over census
Figures just don't add up and have Nevada natives shaking their heads
Las Vegas Review Journal, 7/29/02
http://www.lvrj.com/lvrj_home/2002/Jul-29-Mon-2002/news/19282077.html
SEARCHLIGHT -- No one here, not the local bartender, not the grizzled old miner, not even the
Realtor who prides herself on selling her hometown, can call themselves a native Nevadan.
So says their federal government, anyway.
"That's a big bunch of hooey," said Ella Kay, 90, the oldest resident of a town that is home to
scores of abandoned mines, two casinos and a busy highway, not to mention the birthplace of a U.S.
senator. "We've had a lot of babies born here."
Kay herself doesn't give lie to the statistics from the 2000 Census, which reflect that none of
Searchlight's 576 residents -- or is it 768? -- can call Nevada their birthplace. She was born in Utah. But a

stop by the local bar, the only fast food joint or just about anyplace else in this bump in the road between
Las Vegas and Laughlin easily turns up a few natives.
Small towns: A passing way of life
Toledo Blade, 5/5/02
http://www.toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?Category=SRMAIN
An exodus is under way in most small towns across Ohio and the nation. It's happening in West
Millgrove, and in Beaverdam and Alexandria and Elgin and Grover Hill, too.
While some small Ohio towns near big cities thrive, those in remote rural areas - particularly in
the northwest corner of the state - are home to fewer and fewer residents. It's not that small towns have
changed too much. It's that they really haven't changed at all. When larger cities nearby were opening
superstores and new businesses, these small places were trying to maintain their quiet ways.
Census: Asians gaining wealth
Minnesota Public Radio, 9/17/02

New data from the U.S. Census show Minnesota's Asian population is economically well-off
compared to other minority populations in the state. While the '90s were a prosperous time for Minnesota
as a whole, the numbers show many minority groups did not prosper as much as their white neighbors.
The new round of figures also pinpoints the number of Somalis in the state for the first time. The figure
mirrors other official estimates, but is much lower than what some Somali leaders say.
Census: Minnesota leads nation in Somali residents
Star Tribune, 9/18/02

http://www.startribune.com/stories/1507/3238538.html
Just a decade ago, Somalis didn't figure into the Minnesota landscape. There were no Somali
malls, no Somali restaurants, and there was no camel meat for sale at ethnic food markets.
"When I first came to Minnesota in '92, there were maybe two Somali families here," said Abdi
Samatar, a geography professor who had come to teach at the University of Minnesota.
After a one-year absence from the state, Samatar said, he returned in the fall of 1994 to find that
the Somali community had grown considerably to about 3,000 residents.
By 2000 their numbers totaled 11,164 in Minnesota, according to census data released this week.
Of the 40 states whose data are available, Minnesota has the largest number of Somalis, and most of them
-- 8,933 -- live in the Twin Cities metro area.
Suburban students lead private schools charge

Denise Clapper lives in one of the state's top school districts. Norman students' scores on the ACT
college entrance exam are second-highest in the state, and scores on other state-mandated tests also are
soaring.
But Clapper and her husband are among a growing number of parents living in metro area
suburbs who are bypassing the local public schools and enrolling their children in private schools, new
Census figures show.
All the larger suburban districts in Oklahoma, Canadian and Cleveland counties saw increases in
the percentage of students choosing private schools, according to estimates by The Oklahoman based on
census data. The percentage of students in the Oklahoma City School District choosing private school is
declining.
