IRE 2015 TIPSHEET: Broadcast: How to Get People to Talk

Techniques For Landing Three Types of On-Camera Interviews We Often Need:
1.
2.
3.

The Victim/Family/Protagonist
The Insider or Key Source
The Reluctant Official

Victim/Family/Protagonist Interviews:
-Before you pick up the phone: It’s homework time: Learn everything you can about the person, the subject matter, previous coverage of the
issue. People may take your request more seriously if you show them you will work hard to understand the topic not just trying to get an
interview to meet your deadline.
-Meet in Person Whenever Possible: If you’re asking someone to share a personal story, they are more likely to do that if you connect with
them in a personal way. Show them you are a real person not just a reporter behind a camera.
-Address Reluctance Head-on: Ask, “Why are you hesitant”. Sometimes the reasons for reluctance may be different than you assume. Provide
examples of your previous work so they can gain comfort with the quality and style of your reporting.
-Explain Why They Should Talk to You: Psychologists have found people are more likely to say “yes” if you give them a reason to say yes.
Explain why their story is so important for people to hear and what it would mean to your reporting to include them in the story.
-Be Upfront About Topics You Plan To Cover: People are most comfortable when they have a clear understanding about what you expect from
the interview.
Insider/Key Source Interviews:
-Many of the same victim/protagonist techniques apply: But remember an insider’s reluctance may be greater because they could fear fallout
including retaliation, legal action, or being shunned by people around them.
-Address Risks/Concerns Directly: Ask about their worst fears. What might happen? Pledge that you will continue to report on any
retaliation/repercussions that might occur.
-Appeal to Their Sense of Right & Wrong: Ask questions that focus them on right and wrong: It seems like you’re in a unique position to tell
this story? It sounds like you have information few other people have? If you don’t share it who will? What will happen if this information is
not brought to light? Will this problem/injustice continue if you don’t speak out?
Reluctant Officials:
(Our General rule: public officials who work for taxpayers have an obligation to answer questions about serious issues of public safety or public
trust.)
-Be Transparent About the Topics You Plan to Cover: The more they know about what you expect from the interview the more comfortable
they may be. Explain that interviews help you to gain the most information possible to make the story fair and complete.
-Ask Nicely Even if They Are Not: Be firm but not emotional. You are just trying to get answers on behalf of the public/your viewers.
-Document Your Calls and E-mails: Keep records to show your many attempts to reach/meet with them.
-If No Response – or Negative Response: Consider an e-mail/letter that explains: 1. We have made X# of attempts to reach you for an
interview. 2. We believe public officials have an obligation to answer questions about serious matters of public safety/trust. 3. We will make
every attempt to meet with you to discuss the issue in-depth. 4. We want to be fair and complete in our reporting. 5. If you are unwilling to
meet to answer these important questions be aware we will approach you in a public setting to ask these questions – that is not our preference
– but because you won’t respond we may need to do that to gain a response on behalf of viewers/taxpayers.
