Ten questions editors should ask on computer-assisted reporting
David Boardman, The Seattle Times, and Richard Galant, Newsday
1. Do we really need to use CAR?
What will we learn from computer analysis that we can't find out from ordinary
reporting? Are we simply playing with a new toy, or is it in fact the best tool?
2. Who should do the data entry and analysis?
Is the "grunt work" better handled by entry clerks and data-crunchers, or should
beat reporters be involved to spot things that might otherwise be missed?

3. How much will this cost us?
What will the monetary cost be, in hardware, software, data-acquisition, staff
time?
4. How much time will it take?
What's the timeline for the project? Can we establish milestone dates for
acquisition of data, analysis, launching of street reporting, writing? And what will
be the opportunity costs during that time?
5. What do the experts say?
Are there people in this field who would be reliable advisers ta us on how to deal
with the data? Can they tell us what the potential traps are, as well as the potential
gold mines?

6. Are our minds open?
Are we going into our analysis ready and willing to be surprised, or are we setting
out to prove a point?
7, Where do we add the flesh and blood?
Where, when and how can we put life in the numbers? What's our strategy for
finding people who illustrate what our CAR work discovers?

8. How do we tell the story?
Is our data better presented in a graphical format than in traditional story form? If
it is more traditional, should it be more anecdotal, or explanatory?
9. Are we prepared for fallout?
Almost any good CAR story will be criticized. Have we explained our
methodology clearly? And will the experts hang with us when the storm begins?

10. What do we do for an encore?
How do we follow up on this subject? When and how do we revisit this data?
