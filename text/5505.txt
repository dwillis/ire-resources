Backgrounding strategies
●
●
●
●

Become a student of your subject’s life
Always verify information found online with primary source documents or
interviews
Be prepared to sift through a lot of hay to find your needles
Let your curiosity guide you

Make it a habit
●
●
●

Background yourself to test website accuracy
Background relatives, dates, babysitters, neighbors, etc.
Develop a set of newsroom protocols (checklists are good)

Keep in mind
●
●
●

There is no “magic” website
People aren’t that creative
Extensive backgrounding is key for one-shot interviews

Keep in mind
●
●
●

Good backgrounding can lead to a story
Back up online sleuthing with shoe-leather reporting -- verify and extend what
you find online
“Is there anything in your background I need to know about?”

Stay organized
●
●
●

Use bits of information as keys to unlock new data (e.g., DOB)
If relevant and you have time, expand your search to family, business partners
Log dates/facts/sources/notes in a spreadsheet

Think through your subject’s life
●
●
●
●

Service calls to personal/business addresses
Property/tax records
Obituaries (to find siblings, relatives)
Wedding registries

Social media accounts
Run phone numbers and online handles through search engines, social media
sites, Craigslist

or email addresses into Facebook’s search tool to find other people. That was being used by
malicious actors to scrape public profile information, it said.”

“The one word journalists should add to Twitter searches that you probably
haven’t considered”
How to find breaking news on Twitter

Think like a tweeter
For human disasters (terrorist attacks, shootings, explosions, war, conflict, train
collisions, etc.), try searching for: explosion, terror, attack, horror, OMG, OMGGGG,
WTF, fuck, holy, shit, crash, shot, shots, shooting, terrible, shocking, WOW, people,
run, running, someone, police, bus, car, plane, train, killed
Twitter example: “wtf OR shit OR omg AND explosion OR shooting”
