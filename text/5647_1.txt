UNDER PRESSURE
TIPSHEET
FOR BREAKING NEWS AND DAILY TURNS

• There IS news in the newsroom
(this doesn’t mean someone doesn’t have to go to
the scene but you can help from newsroom)

• Stop
• Keep a level head
• Take a deep breath
• Meet and make a plan
• Talk it out with people whom you respect
• Think creatively
• Be OPEN to possibilities
❖

ASK:

❖ What don’t we know after the
obvious “nuts and bolts”?
❖ What do we WANT our viewers to
know? What should they know?
❖ What would help viewers/readers
understand this event more (put into
context)?
❖ What will help our organization’s
coverage provide that context and help
us stand out?
• Think outside the box to answer above
questions.
• What data might be available?
• How easily is it accessed?
• Is it in a form I can understand and
analyze?
• How fast can I understand and analyze it?

• What value could it provide to our
coverage?
• Where do I go to get data?
✓

DO

when breaking news hits

once a month or once a quarter
• Try using data and responding BEFORE
event happens

• In the effort to get on the air\publish forget
to ask basic who, what, where, why AND
how did I get this information? questions
