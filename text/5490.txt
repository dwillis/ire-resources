KINDS OF VOTING DATA
•Voting registration
•Election participation
•Election results

WHAT ARE WE NOT TALKING ABOUT?
•Campaign finance
•Redistricting
•Lobbying
•Legislative tracking

WHERE DO YOU FIND VOTING DATA?
•Federal, state and local
•Mostly state
•Current vs. complete

STATEWIDE VS. LOCAL
An example… which candidates are going to run for legislature?
• Candidates file in only one county
• Each county election board sends candidate lists to state board three days after
the end of the filing period
• State board has 10 days after filing period to certify candidates and send names
back to the county boards, which then print the ballots.
• Also true for city elections in cities that cross county lines.

STATEWIDE VS. LOCAL
An example…
Which field in the database is the voter registration number?
• voter_reg_num
• ncid
ANSWER: Both.

LOCAL VS. LOCAL

ELECTION DAY IS ESPECIALLY LOCAL

DOCUMENTS THAT
CREATED THE
DATA
That’s Reynal Caldwell’s
signature.
The other writing is not.

DOCUMENTS THAT
CREATED THE
DATA
Even the envelopes are
(eventually) public record

GROUND TRUTH
Address of absentee
ballot was a boarded
up house. No ballot
was cast from the
address.

THERE’S NO SHORTAGE
OF BAD/CONFUSING
VOTING DATA

ARE THESE ’VOTERS’?
•Moved From County
•Moved Within State
•Removed
•Merged Duplicate

TODAY ISN’T YESTERDAY’S
DENOMINATOR
•Voter registration file overwritten every few weeks
•Voter participation file appended after each election
•So ‘REMOVED’ voters appear to have participated in past
elections
•Voters registered in Orange County voted in Wake County
… when they lived there

OTHER MESSY DATA THINGS
•One voter has already voted in the 2018 elections.
•Sometimes “absentee” is a column. Sometimes it is a
row.
•Precinct ‘???’
•Voters whose duplicate records were merged appear
to have voted twice.

OTHER MESSY DATA THINGS
•5,340 supercentarians in N.C.
•98% of which have birthdays of 1/1/1900 or
1/1/1901
•But… half are in one county

BUT ‘MESSY’ ≠ FRAUD

BUT ‘MESSY’ ≠ FRAUD
•Publicly available voter rolls can’t
be used for all that much.
•Is your area one of the 248
counties that recently received
letters from PILF?
