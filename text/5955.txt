COVERING THE MILITARY – A SOURCE & TIP SHEET
By Carl Prine, Sig Christenson and Sam LaGrone
@CarlPrinetweets, @saddamscribe and @samlagrone

Covering the military is tricky. Although it’s a hierarchical bureaucracy, the pathway to a
good source or even an official spokesperson often will prove painful.
This is especially true when you’re on deadline.
Let’s say you really don’t know where to start looking for information about a
subject. Or you need an official statement about something you’re scribbling. These
are probably the places where you could start your trip, but they likely won’t be where it
ends.
The good news is that if you started off at the wrong spot they’ll usually direct you to the
right command.
The bad news is that in today’s highly politicized environment, you might get the
runaround.

CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE
In the last year, CRS reports have become available to the public. These reports are
prepared on behalf of members by CRS to provide a simple explanation to complex
topics. The reports on military hardware and international relations are excellent primers
for beginners and a collection of resources for other sources. It’s also a cool barometer
to see what Congress is interested in.

OFFICE OF ECONOMIC ADJUSTMENT, DEFENSE SPENDING BY STATE
The OEA is little known Pentagon office that tabulates defense spending down to the
county level in every U.S. states. By and large, each county is touched by military
spending in some manner -- either through a military installation or through the defense
industry.

CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE -- CBO
The CBO is a great resource to get a realistic sense of military budgets. Their
shipbuilding report has correctly predicted cost overruns in the Navy’s budget with a
small margin of error for the better part of a decade.

DVIDS
The Defense Visual Information Distribution Service is a clearinghouse for military
imagery that’s searchable by unit and location. You have to apply for a login, but it’s
worth it for the information in the captions alone.

INDIVIDUAL UNIT/COMMAND FACEBOOK AND TWITTER PAGES
In the last two years, the big Pentagon has pushed notifications on deaths, unit
changes, etc., more to individual unit pages than from the main Office of Secretary of
Defense press announcements. You have to check the pages because the people on
the other end of the phone might not now.

Carl’s Story Ideas

Yeah, that’s why you’re really here.
Because I’ve done so much reporting over the years on national security issues, I’ve
encountered pretty much all the uniformed services, plus the U.S. Department of
Veterans Affairs, the Department of Homeland Security and no small number of state
agencies. Nothing surprises me now!

I’m not putting these stories down as an ersatz brag sheet but rather including them
because I can blueprint how I did them and that might help you figure your articles out,
too.

much limned the basics of it in 2013, but I probably should mention how hard the FOIA part of
the story became. Fort Bragg officials never fulfilled even one FOIA request. Not one. When I
tried to get the CID report from the Army after the investigation was officially closed, officers
lied to me and said it didn’t even exist. The only reason why I was able to get the report was
because I already had been linked large sections of it and told the military that if they didn’t fork
it over I was going to put everything I had online, without redactions to protect classified
information or confidential Army sources. That shook it loose. But in the end I relied far more
on the leaked material. If you can’t cultivate trust with whistleblowers or your news outlet won’t
go to court to finagle documents that should be available under FOIA, probing the armed forces
will be difficult.
I’ve written a lot of stories about the VA. I predicted that the cascade of initial claims for
disability pensions would become a flood of appeals, a problem still dogging the agency. And I
figured out how to track medical records privacy violations to show how the VA system is
probably the worst hospital network nationwide at protecting sensitive data. For the former, I
used the online appellate court docket to build (unfortunately largely by hand) a database to track
thousands of veterans’ deaths as their cases languished in the system. For the latter, I built a
mammoth database with tens of thousands of fields to analyze the sheer magnitude of the
problem – and to find interesting voices for my story.
For Wounded Warriors, a series of stories about the horrible care wounded soldiers received
after returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, I was leaked reams of inspection reports on Warrior
Transition Units nationwide. They were an unflinching examination of how the military had
failed its most vulnerable troops, warehousing them in barracks that made the Walter Reed
campus look like Disneyworld. I was able to break it by cultivating sources inside the Pentagon's
Office of Wounded Warrior Care and Transition Policy. It should be mention that the documents
I obtained by FOIA from the agency were redacted in such a way as to appear the exact opposite
of what they were saying. It’s why I relied on secret records the armed forces didn’t want me to
see. Leakers are your friends.
This is a story I turned in days. I’d been tipped off that the nonprofit that ran San Diego’s Fleet
Week was flat broke and the annual celebration for the Navy and Marine Corps was in
jeopardy. I used 990s and California’s charity filings to construct just how badly the organization
was doing and then started asking hard questions about what drove it into the ground. There was
nothing nefarious about Fleet Week, but if you start sniffing around the charities that claim to
help the armed forces and veterans, you’ll find some shady nonprofits.
If you ever want to break the internet, write about a SEAL who moonlights as a porn star !!
