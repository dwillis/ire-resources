CAR requires ‘data state of mind’
 Approach stories expecting to quantify or

measure something
 A belief that data
◦ exists
◦ you can access it
◦ it will give you more power
 some answers
 better questions

 Thinking of data as ‘raw material’

Business == Data
 Business measures everything
 Doing business generates data/documents
 True even if business is "private"

Corporate paper trail


Licenses to operate various
types of businesses (local,
state, federal)

Limited partnership
records (local)



Financial statements (public



Mortgages (local)





Lawsuits (local, state,

Labor union relations (federal)



Environmental permits
(local, state, federal)



Starting points
 What questions do you want to answer?
 Obviously, different stories need different

approaches
◦ Is this a story about a particular company?
◦ Is it a general story about an industry?
◦ Is it a story about the economy?

Banking example
 Banktracker
 Data comes from FDIC quarterly reports

◦ Each bank reports quarterly to FDIC (“call
report” or “condition statement”)
◦ Reports are public
◦ Hundreds of variables per bank
◦ This is clean data
◦ You can find a single bank’s report on
FDIC.gov
◦ Also could do state, city, etc.

Manufacturing employment project
 Our story
 40 years worth of data

◦ Had to go back to paper records
 Actually the Statistical Abstract of the United States
 Historical volumes scanned by Census
 Collected manufacturing employment/total employment
for each state
 Also used Bureau of Labor Statistics web site
 And the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank (FRED) site

 Helped create this interactive map
 Data integral to story
