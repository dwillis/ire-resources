Takeaways
• Start simple and small
– You can easily create an interactive using any
number of tools, from Open Flash to Google
Fusion tables or Tableau Public.

• Work with your artists and designers
– I build an interactive, then they have design
editing power and tell me to change colors,
fonts, layout, etc. I am not a designer or a
graphic artist.

Where to start
• Google Fusion Tables
• Google Charts, with tutorial
• Microsoft’s new SkyDrive WebApps
• Tableau Public
