A few experts with perspectives not often seen/heard in mainstream media:
* Lisa Bero, Ph.D., a professor of health policy and clinical pharmacy at University of
California at San Francisco who researches conflict-of-interest and industry influence on
research and clinical practice. She’s also the Co-Director of the San Francisco Cochrane
Center. bero@medicine.ucsf.edu (415) 476-1067.
“In August 2006, Bero co-authored a paper drawing on rarely available internal
pharmaceutical company documents, showing how one drug manufacturer hired
companies in the 1990s to create continuing medical education programs urging
physicians to prescribe the seizure drug gabapenetin for far broader, unapproved uses.
The company sponsored medical advisory boards and consultant meetings to promote the
expanded uses, and paid the moderators and participants; funded a large study aimed to
familiarize doctors with the idea of using the drug in higher-than-approved doses;
discouraged publication of unfavorable results; and sponsored apparently independent
scientific publications in the medical literature on topics that paralleled their marketing
goals. Many of the activities were organized through third-party companies paid by the
drug company with ‘unrestricted educational grants.’ “
