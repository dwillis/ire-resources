Organize your newsroom around data
- organize your data
- organize your colleagues

How it shouldn’t work: data as research assistance
business

data

sports

education

investigative
politics

How it can feel: the symptoms

● being called in for help when the requests
stall out
● being asked to clean up a spreadsheet
someone else has been fiddling around in
● being asked to make sense of or make
graphics of data at the end of the reporting
process

How it can work better
business

politics

If you build it...
- centralized repository of good data
- standardized codes
- documentation
- audit trail

They still won’t come
… but it’ll be a lot easier to entice them

If you build it: central repository

If you build it: documentation

If you build it: audit trail

Getting them to come: organizing your data community
●

Identify someone from each work group who has some affinity for spreadsheets and a desire to
learn
○ get them comfortable with the basics
■ overview/review courses on data structure AND TERMS!
■ course on spreadsheets
■ course on SQL: with a handout/manual!
○ work with them to identify good datasets to pursue
■ useful for a really great story
■ useful for many stories
■ we check it every day and it’s not well organized
○ get them access to the data
■ baseline: a way to access the spreadsheets
■ better: a way to access them via SQL

Ok, but really: getting them to come

Pursue them
○ suggest story ideas for them in data sets that you could acquire
○ walk them through the process
Show them
○ Tableau + MySQL = graphics = excitement
Don’t do it for them
○ help them build the query
○ provide them with documentation
○ help them sort the spreadsheet
○ … but make them do it (unless it’s a crazy deadline)
Scare the hell out of them
○ MAKE SURE THEY KNOW THAT THERE ARE PITFALLS SO THEY DON’T GO
HUNTING ALONE!
Backstop them
○ Be there to check their work

Show them

And one last thing...

Keep pursuing them!
