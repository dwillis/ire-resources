When there is not data, we need to build our own.

Building your own data
Building or extracting from documents
• Physical surveys or observations
• Testing
• Questionnaires, polls and surveys
• In all of this you may have to use sampling
•

And sometimes data is not in rows and columns

Sampling
Determine the universe
• Methodology for gathering docs/data
• Size will depend on:
•

Level that you will want to break down the data
• The level of accuracy you need
•

Sample types
Random sample – Ever item has an equal chance
of being included.
• Systematic sample – Pulling every Nth record.
• Stratified sample – pulling your sample based on
another underlying number – such as population.
• Oversampling – pulling more of a particular group
to do further research with that group
•

Building/extracting from
documents
May need a random sample
• If you need data entry
•

Services like Mechanical Turk
• Crowdsourcing
• Don’t have just one person enter the data
•

Building/extracting documents
Random sample – or start with one to
test your hypothesis
• Data entry
•

Use verification
• Test before digging in
•

•

Extracting
PDF converters: xpdf, tabula, cometdocs
• Documents/pdfs should be clear
•

Physical surveys
Understand the proper procedures
• Develop guidelines
• Make sure everyone is using the same procedures
•

Physical surveys or testing
Understand the proper procedures
• Use the right equipment
• Consider how you will verify
•

Other examples
Counting vehicles in traffic lanes from official
count points
• Build a database of murders from news reports
• Physically checking work sites, bridges, dams
and just about anything else
•

Get help
ICIJ worked with a lab that could do genetic
testing to determine species of fish bought
at Spanish fish markets.
• Applied random sampling to purchase
various fish offered for sale.
•

Surveys
How will you define sample
• How will you contact people and ensure
responses
• What survey format (online, phone, etc…)
will you use
• Get help developing survey
•

These are NOT scientific surveys
Web polls
• Radio or TV call-in polls
• Man or woman on the street
•

•

America’s Got Talent

When data exists, but it’s bad
Collect your own data to challenge the “official” record

Beyond the basics
Check with experts
• Triangulate – combine surveys and documents
to report from various angles
• Research others’ methodologies
• Oh, and make sure actual data really doesn’t
exist
•

Other uses of sampling
To test a theory before diving into a massive
records hunt
• To double-check your analysis – you should get
roughly the same results from a sample of your
data
•

Find the right methodology
Read research reports
• Find an existing model
• Find an expert
• Duplicate or do spot checks
• Keep detailed notes so you can explain what you did
• If you’re doing a survey or poll – test run it on a few
folk before full launch
•

Communicate to readers / viewers
• Nerd box
• How many surveys did you send and how

many were answered?
• Be up front with caveats

My role as a data journalist for this story:
•

Create system for tracking records requests
• Parsing information as it arrived from different
formats – text, xls, PDF
• Standardizing information. Are we talking about
total people who received aide for the month,
or people receiving it at a given moment in
time?

Many stories about the economic benefits of the
North Dakota oil boom
Fewer stories about the environmental issues, and
those usually about individual spills or incomplete.
NYT sends correspondent to size up the situation,
hoping for quick turnaround story.
Once she realizes extent of the issue, and how
difficult it will be to document, she partners up with
me.

There were no official stats on oil spills — the Federal
Government regulates pipelines, everything else is left
to the states.
North Dakota had lots of public info on oil production,
but it’s mostly in PDF monthly reports.
Spill incidents posted online, but only a few fields of
info, and not searchable – the rest locked in PDFs.
Enforcement actions kept only in file cabinets of
bureaucrats

Creating our own database
1) Downloading the incident records required a scraper. In this
case we used a browser emulator to go through the site and
download the pages
browser = Watir::Browser.new :firefox
browser.goto
'http://www.ndhealth.gov/ehs/foia/spills/defaultOGContained.aspx’
opening_page = Nokogiri::HTML.parse(browser.html)
2) Cleaning up the mess — standardizing company names,
incident types, correcting errors — initial report said zero spilled,
but full text of incident said something else.

Becoming well known that U.S. companies
insert “arbitration” clauses in many consumer
and employment contracts curtailing rights to
bring lawsuits
But how did this come about? And how often
does it happen? And what happens in
arbitration cases?
Investigative reporters start to dig in but realize
they need help
Robert Gebeloff -- @gebeloffnyt- IRE2016

One U.S. state – California – passes law
requiring all firms that conduct arbitrations to
file “disclosure” files for all cases they handle
in the entire U.S.
But these files are a mess. No standards in
what fields the firms disclose, or the data
format.
Solution: Ability to convert any format into a
tabular information; Reporting to determine
which fields of information are comparable
across companies

Reporting shows that the biggest impact is at
the Federal level, with “class action” lawsuits –
multiple small plaintiffs pooling their resources
to take on large corporations.
To get at this: Custom search of Westlaw
(commercial service) U.S. court dockets;
Converting text of dockets into tabular data;
Reading each case and collecting additional
data – what type of case? What did the judge
decide? Etc.

•

The Times investigation was based on thousands
of court records and interviews with hundreds of
lawyers, corporate executives, judges, arbitrators
and plaintiffs in 35 states.
• Since no government agency tracks class actions,
The Times examined federal cases filed between
2010 and 2014. Of 1,179 class actions that
companies sought to push into arbitration, judges
ruled in their favor in four out of every five cases.
• In 2014 alone, judges upheld class-action bans in
134 out of 162 cases.

But by assembling records from arbitration firms
across the country, The Times found that between
2010 and 2014, only 505 consumers went to
arbitration over a dispute of $2,500 or less.
• Verizon, which has more than 125 million
subscribers, faced 65 consumer arbitrations in
those five years, the data shows. Time Warner
Cable, which has 15 million customers, faced
seven.
• One federal judge remarked in an opinion that
“only a lunatic or a fanatic sues for $30.”
