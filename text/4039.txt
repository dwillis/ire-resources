Rifling through the mapping toolbox

Stay flexible
What you need is a tool to solve the problem.
No time for obsession.
Arcmap, QGIS, SQL Server and PostGIS had
troubles creating traditional geodesic buffer.

Euclidean distance!
Wouldn’t work in many situations (longer
distances).
Isn’t as precise.
But it works for this specific instance. That’s
what matters.

Your tools play nicely together
GDAL: Command line, QGIS, Python, TileMill
PostGIS: SQL, GeoDjango, QGIS, TileMill

Geocode all the things!
Step 1: Read the terms of service!
Step 2: Read the terms of service!
Step 3: Relax, and have a home brew

Geocoding terms of service gotchas
Are you required to use the lat/lngs on X
company’s maps API?
Are you allowed to cache the points?
Is there a rate limit?

Geocode all the things!
Google Geocoding API
ArcGIS online geocoding/U.S.A. streets shp
Oatmeal Geocoder (Python) or Ruby Geocoder
● Use the same code for with ESRI, Bing Maps and
Mapquest geocoders

Cuidado!
Pay attention to precision.
Just because the geocoder returns a lat/long
doesn’t mean it is right.
Geocoders will seemingly return lat/long for
anything.

Finished product
We had to eliminate a number
of sites that we could not
confirm.

Many sites were hand coded
using satellite imagery with
street addresses.

End result: Not all sites
included in analysis, but we
didn’t have to worry about
corrections.

Have you tried?
● Mostly transparent tiles
● Tiled data (UTF grids)
● Great for static maps
