CAR for TV: Getting Started
NICAR March 2004

There are dozens of stories you can do with very little CAR experience and very little time
invested in crunching data. Many local and state databases are clean, easy to get, free or
inexpensive, and are also valuable later as look-up tools. For example, after you see who’s using
their city cell phone the most, keep the cell phone number list in your rolodex. NICAR is also a
great source of data that is already clean. Someone else has already negotiated the learning
curve, too. You can also download data off the Internet into an Excel spreadsheet.
You will need to learn Excel and Access software. Both are Microsoft products. You may already
have them in your newsroom. You can learn these through NICAR Boot Camps, at your local
community college, or teach yourself by following the software’s tutorials and using books you
can buy at your local bookstore. NICAR also has exercises you can practice with on its website.
You will use Excel to perform sorts, calculations, and “do math” on data. You will you use
Access to compare two or more databases to each other. For example, you can compare a list of
convicted sex offenders to a list of state employees, or a list of school bus drivers, or EMT’s.
How do you get the data? Ask. Go to each department, whether it’s voter registration, tax
assessor, state purchasing, state or city payroll, etc. Ask them how they keep their data and
what’s involved in your getting a copy of it. Know your public records law. Tennessee, for
example, can only charge what it costs to produce the data. Start early. It’s almost never an
instant process. Don’t promise your news director you will have the project for the next book
until you are done. You will hit snags. There are many useful tips for negotiating for data on the
NICAR listserve. Subscribe. It’s free and very worthwhile.
Here are some simple stories you can do using Excel:
Budget and payroll.
Who’s paid the most? Who got the biggest raises? Who makes the most overtime? Is the payroll
growing or shrinking? All questions that are fairly easy to answer with Excel and the government
payroll.
The state of Tennessee said times were hard; they would have to lay off 200 – 250 people. I had
a database that was about a year old of everyone on the state payroll and their salaries. I asked
for a new database after the layoffs had been made. Use Excel or Access to count the total
number of full-time employees. For the heck of it, calculate the total payroll. Then do the same
on the new database. Hey, I thought there were layoffs -? Where did all these extra people come
from? How come the total payroll is MORE now, than before the layoffs? That’s where you start
asking questions. That’s when you start doing the TV part.
Here’s what the data looked like:

We compared the new data to the old and started asking questions. Here’s an excerpt of how the
finished story came out: (remember, the basis of the story was that the state said it would lay
off hundreds of workers)

(Amons) tape 0335
Our I-Team investigation also discovered that since Governor Bredesen took office: the state has
hired more than 1700 full time workers. 1700. Now, some are replacements for workers who
resigned.. but about 300 hundred were hired for brand new positions. DCS for example.. added
46 new employees ...like caseworker Odessa Helmer. The caseworker training her is glad to have
the help.
(Georgianna Hooker)
"It DOES feel good. And it's created an upbeat environment, throughout the office."
(Amons)
TennCare also added employees... 29 paralegals. Some had been private contractors who now
work for the state.
(Amons)
"How is it we just laid off people but we're hiring other people?"
(Goetz)
"Well because in something as complex as state government, you have different types of needs
in different places."
(Amons)
A shell game? Goetz says no.. just redistributing the workforce.
(Goetz)
"I know it's confusing, but it's the way it works."
<<I-Team animation>>
Excel is very good at finding stories by doing simple sorts. Who gets the most campaign
contributions? What PAC gave the most money? Who uses the state plane the most? Where are
they going? Who had the highest expense report? Who gets the most parking tickets? Once you
have the data in a spreadsheet, it’s simple to sort by the biggest number.

The I-Team looked at how the state’s fleet of planes was being used. We found the third-highest
user was the Board of Regents. This is a database we got from the state of Tennessee’s
Department of Transportation. They keep a record of every flight. It looks like this:

See the field:chg code? That’s what department booked the flight. Flt time is how much time the
plane spent in the air. Using these logs, we could add up which department spent the most time
in the air. (In Excel, sort by chg code, subtotal flt time). When we pulled the detailed records
from each department, we found members of the Board of Regents were flying to their quarterly
board meetings. Most of them brought their husband or wife, which meant the state had to send
extra planes to accommodate them all.
Here’s an excerpt of one of our stories:

Board of Regents Flights 03432
(Amons)
Tennessee's private planes fly members of the Board of Regents to their quarterly
meetings. But who else is flying along for free .. and what's it costing YOU the
taxpayers? State records show most of the Regents bring along spouses.. or family
members.
(Frank Barnett)
"This plane had two empty seats. So what's it cost to put an extra body on board."
(Amons)
Nothing. And it's perfectly fine to do that when there's an empty seat. State policy says so.
(Amons)
"But our I-Team investigation found so many spouses fly to these meetings... they run out
of seats. The state sometimes has to send a second plane... or even a third. . And YOU
pay for it."
Here's one example. December 2002. The Regents meet at a community college in
Blountville. The state's King Air picks up regents Bill Watkins and Maxine Smith in
Memphis. Watkins brings his wife, taking up a seat. The plane then continues on to
Jackson where it picks up Regent Jonas Kisber. Then on to Sparta where it picks up
Regent Noble Cody.. and his wife. The plane heads to Blountville.. six of the eight seats
full, two of them with spouses. So the state sends a second plane to Sparta... to pick up

Regent Jessica Whitehead and her mother Carolyn. That plane also goes to the
Blountville meeting. Three more Regents from Nashville need to get to the meeting. but
the third state plane they had planned to use is needed by another department.. so they go
commercial. Chancellor Charles Manning and Regents Arles Greene.. and John Rose..
fly American Airlines.. 262 dollars each. If the Regents hadn't brought their spouses and
family members.. there would have been enough room for everybody on one state plane.
The second plane and the commercial tickets cost the taxpayers an extra $2792.50.
The story is hard to follow in print, but the graphics and animation made it understandable.
Invest time in telling the story. You use the data to find the story, but you still have to tell the
story.
Another simple spreadsheet story is how many sex offenders in your community are unaccounted
for. If your state has a website where you can look up a sex offender by name, ask for the raw
data that they use to create the website. It will have names, addresses, the crimes they
committed, and other information. A simple story to do is find out what percentage of sex
offenders are listed as having “address unknown.”

Larry Wayne Lay is a convicted sex offender... one of dozens in Montgomery County that
Investigator Sande Olds keeps tabs on.

"He's in compliance right now.."
She means.. he's reporting his address to the TBI every three months, as required under
Tennessee's Sex offender registry law. His landlord.. had he looked on the Internet.. could have

read about Lay's history.
"Did you know he is a convicted sex offender?"
(Carrol Poole)
"Goodness knows! You're kidding!"
(Sande Olds)
"My experience is, they don't know."
The TBI keeps files on more than 53-hundred sex offenders listed on the state's registry.
(Elaine Bomar)
"These are monitoring forms that have been recieved..."
The good news: the TBI has current addresses for about 4-thousand of those required to
register. The number Elaine Bomar isn't so happy with... how many addresses are "unknown."
(Bomar)
"There is 1,046."
More than a thousand convicted sex offenders who didn't send in their quarterly forms are listed
as "address unknown". That's a thousand offenders that you the public has no way to track.
Sometimes, no database exists for a story you want to investigate. You have to build your own.
You can use Excel or Access. Using Excel to build a timeline has helped me grasp stories that
would have gotten away otherwise. Enter the date something happened into a field, then a
description of the event. Sort by the date to help you understand in what order something
happened. If I had not set up a timeline on a state contract story, I might never have realized
that the competing bids weren’t “scored” and “evaluated” until AFTER the contract had been
awarded to “Jungle Marketing,” the highest bidder - the state official’s friend.
