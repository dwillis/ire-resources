Humanity through
Numbers

It’s a unicorn
life ;)

We’re talking about
people. We can’t get
lost in the numbers.

I’m not saying charts are inherently bad. Plus,
sometimes that’s what editors want.

Look for
other
questions
around
the story to
visualize
too.

Rather than just showing the numbers, allow
your readers to get into the story.

Just because you can use something
awesome like D3 to make a chart. . .

How do we represent people?

#OscarsSoWhite

Find the people first. Learn about them. These are
their numbers — not yours.

Often, you’re fighting between a looming
deadline and having the time to integrate
empathy into your story.
There’s not always going to be time to do both.
But it’s something we need to really think about.
