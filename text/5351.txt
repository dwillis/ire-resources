Hands on with health data
NICAR 2018
Charles Ornstein & Ryann Grochowski Jones
(This tipsheet can be found at ​http://bit.ly/nicaropioids​)
For our hands on class, we will be working with data sets released by the ​Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services​ (CMS) and the ​Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention​ (CDC). Medicare is the federal public health insurance program for
the elderly and disabled. Medicaid is a state-federal public health insurance
program for the poor. The CDC is the main U.S. agency dedicated to public health.
The data for this session are available here:

Dataset #1: Part D Opioid Geographic Data
This dataset can be downloaded at the link above or here:
https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-an
d-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/Downloads/Part_D_Opioid_Geographi
c_Data.zip
When you unzip the file, you will see an Excel spreadsheet. In it are worksheets
for State, County and ZIP Code. This data represents 2013-2015 data from
Medicare Part D, Medicare’s prescription drug program. As of March 2018, this is
the most-recent data. The program covers billions of prescriptions to seniors and
disabled people.

We will use this data to work on sorting and filtering.
Dataset #2: Medicare Part D Opioid Prescriber Summary File
This dataset can be downloaded at the link above or here:
https://data.cms.gov/Medicare-Part-D/Medicare-Part-D-Opioid-Prescriber-Summ
ary-File-201/6i2k-7h8p
This is a large file. When you download it, you can look up prescribing patterns of
individual doctors in the Medicare Part D program. This data includes only 2015
data, but CMS publishes it for 2013 and 2014, as well. Once you have identified a
state or ZIP code of interest in the first dataset, you can drill down into the data,
looking for individual doctors, in this dataset.
Again, we will be working on sorting and filtering.
Dataset #3 and 4: CDC data on opioid prescribing rates
This data covers 2015 and 2016.
First, you will want to open up a new Excel workbook. ​Then, and this is very
important, you will want to go to Column C, highlight it, right click, select format
cells and select text. ​It will look like this:

The reason you want to do this is that we will be pasting data into this column
that we want to be ingested as text. If you do not do this step, it will come in as a
number (and Excel will drop the leading zero.)
Next, go to this website:
https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/maps/rxcounty2016.html
Scroll below the map and highlight everything beginning with “County” until the
bottom of the spreadsheet:

Now, go back to Excel and paste this into your workbook. ​DO NOT PASTE IT
NORMALLY. Rather, paste it special. And select text. You do this by clicking on
the triangle under the paste button. Do not click the paste button and don’t use
Control V.

Your data will look pretty:

At the bottom of the Excel workbook, title your sheet 2016.

Now open another worksheet and do the same thing for the 2015 data.
https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/maps/rxcounty2015.html​ Remember to
reformat column C. Then label this spreadsheet 2015.
At this point, you should have two nicely formatted sheets.
For this assignment,​ we will go over sorting, filtering and VLOOKUP. We’ll also
talk about the importance of comparing measures over time.

Using lookups in Excel
One of the most powerful tools in a database manager is the ability to join tables.
Excel has some tools that allow you to join data from multiple sheets.
In the CDC datasets, we’re going to use a tool called VLOOKUP, which will let us
pull data from 2015 into our chart for 2016.
First, we have to get our data ready to join. To do that,
1) You must have followed the steps above to prepare your data.
2) Next, you’ll need to create a unique ID field upon which to match the
sheets. Luckily, our datasets have a FIPS code, a unique ID for counties and
states. ​NOTE: It is necessary to put your unique key in column A for this to
work.
3) In your 2015 sheet, cut Column C and insert the cut cells in Column A. This
will move your FIPS code to the first column, which is required for this task.
This is what each spreadsheet will look like:

Do the same thing in the 2016 file.
Now you are ready for the VLOOKUP.
We want to compare prescribing rates in 2016 to 2015. They are in different
sheets. So in the 2016 sheet, you want to add a column to the right of column D
and call it, “2015 prescribing rate.”
In cell E2, we’ll add our formula:
=VLOOKUP(A2, 2015!A$1:$D3144,4,FALSE)
Let’s walk through this formula:
A2​ is the cell that contains the location ID in the 2016 file.
2015!A$1:$D3144 is the range of cells in the spreadsheet called 2015. The dollar
signs are there because as you copy the formula down, Excel will want to
increment them. This prevents the formula from changing to A2:C112 and
A3:C113 and so on…
4​ is the column that contains the information you want to pull in, in this case 2015
prescribing rate. The lookup code MUST be the first column. You actually need to
count the columns and not use the column letter.
False​ means that your data has to match 100% (remember, nerds in closets
invented this software – it’s not always intuitive)
Just like with most formulas, copy it down to the bottom of the spreadsheet.
Check out what you’ll see.

One last thing you’ll want to do is add a Column F and call it “DIFFERENCE.” (Write
the word “DIFFERENCE” in cell F1). Now in F2, enter this formula =D2-E2. What
this is telling Excel is
= We are doing math
D2-E2 Take the value in D2 and subtract the value in E2 from it. Take 2016’s rate
and subtract out 2015’s rate.
Finally, you’ll want to filter out the #VALUE (This happens because you aren’t
subtracting numbers.)
You can now compare prescribing rates in 2016 to 2015 without going back and
forth among different spreadsheets.
With thanks to Jennifer LaFleur for the VLookup template.
