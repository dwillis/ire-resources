The data
• CMS Plan Payment Data: Includes the Medicare Advantage Part C
records at the plan level with contract and payment data.
• CMS Monthly Enrollment: Includes aggregated Medicare monthly
enrollment records at the county level.

• Fee-For-Service Data: Includes risk scores for traditional Medicare
program at the county level.

Mash up the databases
• Import into a database manager. We used Microsoft SQL Server.
• Clean and test data integrity.
• Join the three tables and select columns for analysis.
• Export to Excel as a single table for analysis.

Methodology
• Plan C costs and payments to private insurers are based on risk scores.
• FFS data includes calculated risk scores for comparison.
• Plan C data is at Plan level; FFS data is at county level.
• For comparison, weight Plan C data to calculate risk scores at the county
level.
• Calculate risk score gaps between MA private insurance plans and FFS.
• Calculate growth in risks scores over time and growing gaps over time.
• Calculate costs associated with gaps and growing risk scores.

Advice
• Understand risk scoring: Risk scores explained.
• Understand weighting.
• Know the limitations in the data. There are many.
• Be comfortable working with estimates and what you can conclude
from those estimates that actually constitutes evidence of risk score
upcoding.
• You are reducing uncertainty, not calculating an exact score.

Visualization reduces complexity
• How risk scores changed.
