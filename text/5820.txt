Keeping your career lit while raising
humans
@MeganLuther

Biggest Problems…. In order
• The Shift
• Mental Load
• Parental leave
• Travel
• Unfriendly workplace

THE SHIFT
• You are in a progressive, equal partnership…. Until you have a kid

Carrying the “mental load.”

When you ask you partner to do a household task, you are the
manager of the household.
• “Ask for help”
• Reminding my husband, does not lessen my mental load. Still leaves it on my
list.
• Realize the lengthy list of what your partner doesn’t know: diaper size,
daycare schedule,
• Outside influences don’t help: daycare provider, family

How do we lighten?
• List you load
• Give up complete control (start small)
• Prepare for failure (and be okay with it)
• Birthday parties not medical
• Sports
• Close to breaking point….transfer something big
• Train outsiders. “Actually, my spouse is in charge of xyz”

Stop the guilt
• “Are my sons alive?”
• “Are my sons making meth?”
• Helps no one
• Remember: You are setting an example

• Be honest with yourself:
I would be a shitty stay-at-home parent

Parental leave
• Fight for it (before expecting)
• Negotiate with manager instead of HR
• Get it in writing
• Take it all
• Establish that bond
• Realize your worth while you are gone

• Do a memo before you leave: shows you and your boss your contributions

Travel
• Negotiate a travel cap
• Mental load shifts by default
• Be consistent
• #NICAR19 meltdown
• I nix souvenirs: I don’t want my kids to think it’s an apology gift. I did nothing
wrong by traveling

Ideal Workplace
• Flexible hours
• Not just understanding boss… SUPPORTIVE boss
• “Get shit done” boss
• Cognizant of co-workers/bosses who are not parents
• No longer hide: Family-related questions should be part of your interview
• Take your kids to work (good for them, coworkers, boss) even if that means flying
• Consider negotiating fewer hours. 30 the magic number
• How your boss handles a miscarriage, predicts how family-friendly they will be

Present Parenting
• When I’m there, I’m present
• “Do you want to play?” No.
• Tuck away the laptop/phone each
night
• Work stays while I’m on vacation

Sacrifice something
• Meals
• Activities/Sports (only one
activity/sport at one time)
• Organization/Cleaning

Multiple kids? Divide and conquer

While working on investigations…
• Explain age-appropriate “why mommy has to work”
• Kids think shit is cool
• Communicate
• Adjust the schedule
• Daddy bonding time
• F “time management”
• Read during TV/playtime
• Children help with sources
