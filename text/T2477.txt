υ PREVIEW THE MAIN ELEMENTS
You’ve shot dozens of tapes, numerous interviews and plenty of b-roll. How do you
make that compelling television, especially in the critical first 30 seconds? For our
“Picture of Deception” investigation documenting an identity theft ring, we summarized
our best elements on the first page of the script without giving away the entire story. By
highlighting what’s to come, you draw the viewer into the story without getting bogged
down at the start. The story also called for creative production techniques for pacing and
clarity. We used chapter dividers to make the chronology easier to understand.
υ BUILD THE MAIN CHARACTERS
Less is more. A complicated investigation can be told through a few powerful characters.
In our “911 Disconnect” series, we showed how the Broward Sheriff’s Office was taking
a long time to answer emergency calls. The extensive data we analyzed proved just that.
We found good examples, but none more compelling than the parents of a toddler who
died after the nanny tried to call 911 three times and didn’t get an answer.
υ MATCH THE GRAPHICS TO THE SUBJECT
In an investigation called “Death Under Fire,” the documents were crucial. But there
were hundreds of them, so we had to identify the most important ones to visualize. We
took the fire department theme and adapted it to the documents by incorporating a helmet
and other items. In effect, the documents became “characters” through this visual
technique and made the story easier to follow.
υ PRODUCE CREATIVE STAND-UPS
All too often there’s a tendency to use a stand-up to explain something where there’s no
video. That doesn’t mean you can’t think out of the box. For example, we used aerials to
visualize multiple locations in a story about police using the same radar gun to issue
tickets around the same time.
