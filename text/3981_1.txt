But Megadeals Are Surging

And So Are Their Costs

Case Study: Nissan in Mississippi
 A Good Deal for Mississippi? Report by

Good Jobs First, commissioned by United
Auto Workers
 Phil Mattera,
Good Jobs First
Research Director
(former business
journalist, longtime
IRE member)

Key Findings
 Special state legislature vote (known) was

$295 million

 But actual cost (unknown) is ~$1.3 billion
 $160M in workers’ personal income taxes!

 Cost per job ~$290,000
 Extensive use of temp workers

 Fiscal stress for localities

Research Methods
 Exhaustive Nexis and Factiva search, build

chronology

 State and local agencies: FOIAs (tax

credits never revealed) and minutes

 Consultant report, dissertation, compliance

audits

 City-county tax-base tensions, interviews

Megadeals
 240 deals @ $75 million to $5.6 billion
 Number and cost up sharply since 2008
 Average cost per job: $456,000

 Only ½ to manufacturing
 New York and Michigan top spenders
 Sources beyond online disclosure

Linking Campaign $ to Subsidies
 Problem: City officials often drive deals, but

big $$ are from state, schools, and county

 Problem: Local campaign $ disclosure is

inferior

 Problem: biggest subsidies are prospective

(not yet disclosed)

 Solution: find a place w/o government-

layer problems

WAMU: “Deals for Developers”
Julie Patel & Patrick Madden

Key Takeaways
 10 developers dominate campaign $, hog

subsidy trough of $1.7 billion

 Land sold at fire-sale prices to big donors
 Timing of campaign $ tracks subsidy

grants

 Responses: public campaign financing bill;

WaPo editorial; mayoral candidate veers

Relations Mapped, Sequenced

Direct Pay-To-Pay Uncovered

Method Advice
 Organize around big subsidy and land

deals

 Then build out the corporate ties (LLCs,

employees, spouses, children, etc.)

 Verify relationships with targets
 Excel, pivot tables (“manual” matching)

and Fusion tables
