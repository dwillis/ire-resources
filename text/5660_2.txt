state. And reported to the US DOT.
◼ Are federal dollars in play? Local spending
can be reported to federal agencies.

Work?
….
And How Do They Really Work?
◼ A government agency that claims it

oversees things
◼ An industry that touts self-regulation
◼ Laws written to address problems
◼ What might seem fair
◼ Contrast how things are done elsewhere
or in similar endeavors

Tips and sources
◼ Whistleblowers. Examples: State

Farm, oil spill, wikileaks
◼ Tips from sources.

◼Experts. Be careful of those with

agendas.

Evaluating stories
◼Impact
◼Importance
◼The public stake

◼Originality
◼Scope

◼Real harm
◼Wrongdoing
◼Naming names and going deep

Diana’s list
◼ It’s illegal.
◼ It’s improper, like questions of conflicts or

rules.
◼ It’s wrong. There is no law but should be.
◼ It’s perverse. A law that has unintended
consequences.
◼ It’s hypocritical.

The thesis
◼ What is your story about? Think of the nut

graph. Or the evening news promo. How
might it go?
◼ The maximum: How grave are matters?
◼ The minimum: If all goes wrong, what will
you have? If it’s nothing, recognize it
could be nothing.
◼ Scope

The verifiable truth
◼Follow the money
◼Follow the document trail
◼Apply a document frame of mind

◼Create your own documents
◼Using databases

◼Mining research and library sources
◼People sources
◼Storytelling

The Document Frame of Mind
◼ The Outer Circle: Secondary Sources

– Clips, reports, experts
– (Also check who’s trampled on this turf
◼ Primary Sources:

– Insiders, whistleblowers
– primary documents from incorporation
records to financial filings to enforcement
actions to lawsuits
