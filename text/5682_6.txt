The problem:
No one knows what stuff costs
in health care.

Our solution
• We’re telling people real health-care prices.
• An MRI: $300 or $13,389.40?
• An ultrasound: $120 or $1,325?

How we do it
• We survey providers on prices to pre-populate
our database
• We use government data to show what Medicare
pays for a given procedure (benchmark)
• We put our interactive widget on partners’ sites,
allowing community to both share and search
• Call people to come over and contribute (or
search)
• Make great journalism
• Lather, rinse, repeat
