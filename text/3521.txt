Building a Watchdog Culture
IRE National Conference
Orlando, Florida
June 2011

PUT THE RIGHT FRAMEWORK IN PLACE
•
•
•
•

Look hard at your newsroom: If watchdog work is important to you, does your
structure reflect it?
Analyze beats and team structures. What should you stop doing to put more
emphasis on exclusive enterprise? On investigative work?
Do you have feet on the street? Isn't that your priority?
Aim for an I-editor or I-team if you can. Somebody has to set the agenda.

INFUSE WATCHDOG IN YOUR NEWSROOM
•
•
•

Evaluations and written goals should emphasize what you want.
Plan for it. Do your weekly meetings emphasize exclusive enterprise? Do you call
a timeout -- and brainstorm -- when you notice that budgets are focused on
yesterday's news?
Give feedback -- especially applause.

HAVE A STRATEGY TO FREE UP TIME
•
•
•
•

We're ALL too thinly staffed. But refuse to let that be an excuse.
Engage your staffers for their ideas on how to carve out time -- a day here, a day
there -- for investigative work, big-bang enterprise.
Everybody's swamped? Devise a strategy to rotate a team of reporters on and off
a project so no single person gets tied up. That keeps the beast fed and beats
covered while your staff produces thunderclap moments.
If you can't free up one editor to oversee a project full time, can you share editing
duties among a team of editors?

PROVIDE RESOURCES AT NO COST, LOW COST
•
•
•
•

Do you share reporting tools with your staff on an intranet?
Look at what IRE offers (along with SPJ, others) to provide Web-based
resources and tools for reporters. See Doug Haddix's tips on great Web tools for
investigations (www.mediafire.com/haddix<http://www.mediafire.com/haddix>).
Do you make it easy for readers to feed investigative tips through your Web
site?
Look for cheap training -- IRE Webinars, regional workshops.

SELL YOUR BOSSES ON VALUE OF WATCHDOG
•
•
•
•
•
•

Investigative reporting is good business.
Great watchdog work drives audience.
Thunderclaps create buzz in your community.
Readers give you credit -- watchdog elevates your news organization in their
eyes.
Show the publisher examples of how great watchdog work is an investment in
growing and retaining readership.
Make the business case for investing in tools and training.
