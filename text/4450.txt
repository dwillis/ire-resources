Story planning
» Do you have a story that fits independent testing?

» Does someone already do the testing, but is it
rarely seen by the public?

» Is there reason to doubt the government testing?

» Is it practical to do your own?

Do your homework
» What am I testing for? Don’t think: “Let’s test
water” – Do think: “Let’s test water for
pharmaceuticals.”
» Know the regulations. What are max/min or
threatening amounts?
» Research what’s been done already and
methodology and find a lab that fits.
» Ask the experts, answer “how many” question
because mileage may vary
-Ellen Gabler, Joanna Lin, Andrea Rock IRE ‘11

Restaurant inspections
“A contractor discovered
“hundreds” of cockroaches and…
inspectors found that employees
weren’t properly washing their
hands, raw food was sitting out
and the restaurant was in general
disrepair.”

» No need for independent testing
» Same with other government inspections, but
many rarely see the light of day: gas pumps, retail
prices on shelves, scales for produce etc.

Pool water quality
“Of the 36 pools, about half had
tests come back as
‘bacteriologically unsafe for
swimming’ this summer.
About half had tests come back
positive for pseudomonas, a
nasty bacteria that causes
swimmer's itch and other skin or
ear infections.

» Already tested independently, but no public access
» Lots of pushback, you’re threatening their business
» Quality improved after report

Do it yourself
» Some “testing” doesn’t even need a lab, just data

» Stay organized. Take photos. Log entries in Excel.
» Remember the “so what” and answer in advance

Loud rock concerts

» $60 tool from Radio Shack
» Good for bar noise in neighborhoods
» Boat noise or other noise complaints

Old tires

» NTSB investigating + Brian Ross (‘08 and ’14)
» Tires shouldn’t be sold six years old and older
» Easy project to walk into your used tire sales center

Get the lab involved
» Make sure lab is accredited and understand exactly
what you’re looking for.

» University labs will offer free/discounted rates

» Get price estimate early. Some are $10, some are
$600 each individual test.
» See if there’s a cheaper “screen” instead of test

Dirty beer tap lines

» Bacteria “infects” beer and spoils it.
» Tap lines should be cleaned every two weeks

Toxic skin creams
Creams promising to lighten skin,
eliminate age spots and zap
freckles contain high levels of
mercury, a toxic metal that can
cause severe health problems, a
Tribune investigation has found.
The newspaper sent 50 skinlightening creams to a certified
lab for testing, most of them
bought in Chicago stores and a
few ordered online. Six were
found to contain amounts of
mercury banned by federal law.
-Chicago Tribune 2010

» Important to test for right kind of mercury
» This one can be spendier due to costs of testing

Contaminated water
Nationwide, water is screened for
lead by checking the first sample
of water from homeowners'
faucets.
But results of recent federal
testing in Chicago show that
although all homes passed that
first test, nearly 45 percent had
lead levels spike when more
water samples were taken
directly afterward.
-Chicago Tribune 2011

» Good example of not trusting local results
» EPA results (shielded until appeal) were better
