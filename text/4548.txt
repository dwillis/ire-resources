sent out the draft for comments,

Pharmacies Fought Controls
Industry at the Focus of Meningitis Outbreak Beat
Back More Federal Oversight
By THOMAS M. BURTON, JAMES V. GRIMALDI

Lawmakers eventually abandoned their push after
deciding the issue wasn't important enough.
In a newsletter to members, the academy
described how it defeated a 2007 bipartisan draft bill that
would have given the FDA more authority to regulate
compounding pharmacies after hundreds of its
pharmacists canvassed Capitol Hill urging lawmakers to
abandon the proposed legislation. …
