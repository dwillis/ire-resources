Investigating Outbreaks
( I t ' s not just about food)

Pandemic influenza: I s your state ready for H I N l v sreturn next fall?
Health experts expect the new H l N l swine influenza strain will return to the U.S. when the flu season
returns next fall and winter. Despite years of planning for a potential pandemic, many states and cities remain
unprepared. Some resources and tips for investigating the capabilities of local officials:,
Examine your state health department's performance in the weeks following the identification of the
new H I N l strain. When were they notified by the CDC? When and how did they notify local health
departments, hospitals and doctors? Did they provide clear guidance on testing protocols? Did the state
have a planlpolicy for the use of school closures and cancellations of large public events? Request
documents.
Look closely at laboratory capacity. Was your state lab able to handle the surge in samples needing
testing? Ask for testing logs to calculate backlogs and delays. Examine unfilled positions and the
impact of furloughs. How long did it take your state to be certified by the CDC to run the H I N l test?
Ask for any "after-action" reports generated about the lab's performance, lessons learned and what
needs to be done to improve performance.
Are schools prepared to make needed closures to slow an outbreak? Do they have policies in place?
Does the state have the legal authority it needs to order school closures? If any schools closed due to
H I N1 this spring, request copies of correspondence among school and health officials: Was there
confusion? Are there any after-action reports?
Investigate the availability and distribution of antiviral medications (such as Tamiflu) during the spring
outbreak. Did the distribution system work? Were there shortages? Many states have failed to fully
stockpile federally subsidized antivirals for use in a pandemic:
www.pandemicflu.gov/plan/states/antivirals.html.
Request copies of all reports on pandemic drills conducted by state and local agencies. How well did
they perform?
HHS Assessment of Pandemic Preparedness: www.~andemicflu.uov/~lan/states/state
assessment.html.Ask
your state health department to release documents and correspondence with CDC about this evaluation.
Trust for America's Health report on lessons learned about pandemic preparedness in health officials'
initial response this spring to the emergence of the new H I N1 strain.

CDC's 2008 evaluation of each state on its emergency/bioterrorism preparedness:
http://www.bt.cdc.aov/publications/feb08phprep/Use your state open records law to request follow-up
correspondence between your state health department and the CDC. Also request any more recent
evaluations.
Lab capacity is critical to identifying outbreaks. What has your state public health lab done with the
millions of dollars it was given to make it better prepared for a bioterrorism attack or a pandemic? Has
your state spent the money it was given? htt~://www.oin.hhs.nov/oas/re~0rts/re~ion5/50500031

Sick passengers
Federal regulations require airlines to immediately notify health officials of any passenger or crew
illness involving diarrhea or a two-day fever or any fever with a rash, swollen glands or jaundice before their
flight reaches an airport. The CDC has requested that airlines also report anybody who has a fever plus
difficulty breathing, headache with stiff neck, reduced level of consciousness or unexplained bleeding. Such
symptoms "may indicate a serious, contagious illness." But it rarely happens. How often are people with
serious illnesses traveling through your airport?
Request the database of EMS runs at your airport. How did EMS and airline response change after th
H l N l outbreak was ide'ntified?
Check out CDC's proposed rules on airlines and communicable diseases:

Notifiable diseases
Certain diseases are required by law to be reported to your state health department and CDC. Are local
doctors, hospitals and laboratories filing required reports - and are they filing them as quickly as they're
supposed to? Despite such reports being critical to quickly identifying outbreaks and preventing the spread of
disease, they often are filed late -and sometimes not at all.
State notifiable disease databases contain information such as: Disease, date of onset, date of report
to health department, whether the person died or was hospitalized, date of death, county of person's
residence, name of hospital where treated. Some diseases, such as MRSA, aren't required to be
reported to CDC and are only collected locally. Each state health department has their own list and
their own timetables for reporting specific diseases. Ask for the database of individual reports (with the
nameladdress fields removed). Reportable diseases in California are listed at:

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's MMWR (Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report),
released Thursdays. htt~://www.cdc.nov/mmwr/Reporters can get on an email list to receive an
embargoed copy early Thursday morning by contacting CDC's press office. The MMWR contains tallies
of the number of new cases reported by state health departments to CDC in the previous week and
cumulatively. Provides comparison stats for the previous year.
Statelcountv death certificate databases - and paper documents. Can be helpful in identifying
people who died of specific diseases. Remember: The documents may have more information than the
data! Autopsy reports, when available, are also helpful.

School vaccination law compliance
State laws require children attending public and private schools be fully vaccinated against a variety of
diseases to protect them individually as well as prevent outbreaks in the community. Laws also cover day care
centers. Are the laws being enforced in your schools and day care centers? They aren't at many in Atlanta.

Request audit data (or paper forms) for individual schools and day care centers.
Look at the use of medical, religious and personal preference exemptions.
Examine outbreaks and whether lax vaccination has played a role.
