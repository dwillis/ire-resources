IRE 2004 Atlanta: Broadcast Skills: Finding Story Ideas
Nancy Amons WSMV-Nashville namons@wsmv.com

Databases are a great way to confirm a hunch, find a story you didn’t expect to find, or to get information without
officials knowing exactly what you’re looking for. They continue to be valuable for years as look-up tools, and as
comparisons for year-to-year changes in government. A database for broadcast is the same as any other reporter’s
tool; you still have to complete your research, find the people affected, do your interviews, and write your story. The
story is not the database. The best TV stories, and the best print stories, usually make only a passing reference to the
computer aspect of the story.
A database is a collection of fields that have different pieces of information. Make sure you know what each field
means. Ask for a data or record layout. You may find a hidden story in a field you didn’t expect.
For example, while doing a story on speeding tickets, I noticed a field that indicated whether or not the ticket was
reported to the state Department of Safety. There’s a story. Why are certain tickets NOT reported to the Department
of Safety? Are there people who’ve gotten a number of tickets, but keep their license? Is there a field that indicates
whether a person has been to traffic school? Do some people go to traffic school more than once?
I set out to do a story about people caught driving more than 100 miles an hour. The city gave me a database of
some 300,000 tickets written over a three-year period. After doing my first story, I mined the database for other
stories. By doing a simple sort by driver’s license number, I found a dozen or so people who had more than 10
tickets each. By looking at the field that indicated the disposition of the ticket, I found that some people were
allowed to repeat traffic school several times a year. By checking their state driver’s record, I found that those
tickets did not appear on their licenses. Some were keeping their licenses by going to traffic school over and over
again. I also matched databases from several jurisdictions to find people who multiple tickets in jurisdictions that
weren’t reporting them to each other.

This is a story that can be done in every state where driving school information is not reported to a central authority.
So – find the story in the database. Then look at the other fields that you might use for hidden stories. Finally, keep
the data for future stories. You might want to analyze the vehicle registrations to find people caught speeding in
government-owned cars. You might want to do a traffic analysis five years later to find out if people are driving
faster than they were. The database is also handy as a look-up tool. Say you have a tag number and you want to
know who it belongs to. Check your database. Say you have a name and you can’t find the person. See if he’s had a
speeding ticket.

Another example of finding hidden stories in databases: I set out to look at who was using executive aircraft for the
Tennessee Valley Authority. I asked for a database of aircraft use. Unfortunately, all I got was the paper records, so
I set out to create my own database. It ended up looking like this (I’ve eliminated a few fields):

The obvious story was that the chairman was using the TVA plane to fly back and forth to his home in Tupelo,
Mississippi. We calculated the cost and did one story on that. I noticed a lot of weekend travel, and started to pursue
where else the TVA plane was going on weekends. Why go to Bristol, Tennessee, on a Friday in May? That’s
where the story got a new set of wings. TVA, we found out, was hosting expensive parties at a racetrack that they
called “economic development dinners.”

TVA said it was a "dinner meeting" "for economic development"
Where exactly, we asked? That's where the story revs into high gear.
<<video of Bristol motor speedway>>
This is Bristol motor speedway where, twice a year, high above the track, TVA
entertains in its skybox.
The I-Team has obtained pictures of that August 2002 event. The one TVA
described to us as an "economic development dinner"
It was a party, on race day.
(Amons) "Is that a business dinner?"
(Glenn McCullough, TVA Chairman)
"Bristol Motor Speedway is a unique venue. In the TN Valley. There is
no other venue like it. So TVA and economic development officials, our
power distributors, host people at the Bristol Motor Speedway, and I'm
pleased that a number of the people have invested in the valley and
created jobs."
Lots of companies wine and dine clients for business purposes. But how many
of the people at this party are from businesses being courted by TVA? Is the
event worth the cost?
(McCullough)
"The Bristol Motor Speedway is a unique venue to showcase the
valley.” "
(Amons)
"Not just drinking and partying?"
(McCullough)
"The Bristol motor speedway is an opportunity for us to put the TN
valley advantage before site selection consultants from all across the
country and the world.
(amons) "Not just drinking and partying?" (McCullough) "The Bristol
motor speedway is an opportunity for us to showcase one of the
unique venues in the Tennessee Valley." (Amons) "I think I'm hearing
a recording, here."
<<tequila song, photos of employees shooting Tequila >>
This is Glenn McCullough in the third row.
These people lined up at the TVA skybox bar who appear to be shooting
Tequila? The ones wearing TVA shirts? None of them are hot business prospects.
In fact, half the people invited to the skybox, are TVA employees.
The party cost in excess of $100,000. You paid for it through your monthly
electric bills.

So again, mine your data for more than one story. There are hidden stories in every database, beyond the obvious.
When you run across data that deserves a second look, make a note of it. I keep an Access database with story tips in
it. If I see another possible story that I can’t get to right now, I’ll note it in my story tips database and get back to it
later.
Keep databases on hand. I got a personnel database of state workers one year. The next year, after the state
announced it had laid off hundreds of workers, I asked for a new database. I compared the two, and found the state
had, in fact HIRED more workers – many more than had been laid off. The bottom line was that the payroll had
gone up, not down.
To find stories in data, try mining state and local government databases. They’re usually free or cost very little. If
you want some ideas of databases you can ask for, just look in the government listings in your telephone book, or on
the state or city government website. From airports and agriculture to finance, workplace safety and veteran’s
affairs, most departments keep databases. Ask what they have. Look for the hidden stories.
Here’s an easy story to do with data from the Department of Agriculture, whose Weights and Measures Division
inspects gas pumps. Are you getting what you pay for when you buy a gallon of gas? Look for a field that indicates
a pump came up short. Sort by the pumps that were shorting customers the most:

It’s a story your viewers might find timely for summer vacation driving, with the cost of gas at record-high levels.

Browse for government databases that are available.
Find the obvious stories, then look for fields that have second or third stories
Match databases together: find bus drivers with DUI’s, school teacher felons, etc.
Keep the data as a reference for later use.
