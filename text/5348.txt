Corruptionville
County Needs
MONEY!
• Its schools, towns, villages, etc. decide to collect
property taxes to fund their budgets.
• How much they collect is called a levy.
• Together, they want to collect $10,000, but
Corruptionville only has two property owners…

Granny Bingo-Dauber
• Only income is Social Security
• Owns a modest home

Mr. Moneybucks
• Disgustingly rich
• Owns an office building..

What are the properties worth?

Taxable value on the assessment roll is $1 million, as determined by
Corruptionville County’s elected assessor. What could go wrong?

Assessment:
$100,000

Assessment:
$900,000

How large will the tax bills be?

• Hold on. We need to know the tax rate first.
• Divide the total of all the levies in the county, $10,000
by the total value of all the property, $1 million.
Answer is 0.01 or 1 percent.
• $10,000 / $1 million = .01 x 100 = 1%
• Usually, there are different rates for each government
• Sometimes, there are different tax rates for different
kinds of property, like residential or commercial

SOOO, how much!!!!????!!!

Moneybucks challenges assessment
• Moneybucks’s property is worth
$900,000 depending on which
appraiser you ask
• There is a margin of error in
assessing, and property owners can
take advantage of it in some states
• In Corruptionville, grievances can’t
result in an assessment going up,
and challengers can get even a small
reduction in their assessment
• They also get two chances for a
more favorable appraisal of their
property, one with a government
board and one with the courts
• What could go wrong?

Moneybucks gets a reduction
• He hires a wellconnected lawyer
• Government board
rules $899,000, but
Moneybucks appeals
• A judge he contributed
money to then sets an
assessment of
$800,000, even though
the property is worth
$900,000

Will governments lower their levies?

Granny strikes back!
• She can’t afford the increase on her
Social Security, but she knows
property tax exemptions lower
assessments or her “taxable value.”
• Sometimes offered to
homesteaders, seniors, clergy,
veterans or nonprofits or for home
improvements and many more
• Corruptionville has a generous one
for clergy, so what could go wrong?

Granny forms a religion
• Ordains herself in BingoDauberism
• Calls in some favors at the
assessment department,
bypassing controls.
• Gets $90,000 taken off her
assessment through the
clergy exemption.

Granny owns it.
