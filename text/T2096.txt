VOTER REGISTRATION
•
•

Available from the county, vendors or your library/research center.
Records will give address, and sometimes date of birth, place of birth and phone
number. Use the address to search for other individuals using the same
address. These names could be useful when searching, for example, phone
directories, property records and court records.
LOCAL NEWSPAPERS

•

Check the newspapers covering the areas where the individual has lived. If you don't know
what papers are online, go to http://www.ibiblio.org/slanews/internet/archives.html for listings by
state.

FREE PHONE DIRECTORIES

Here are the most commonly used sources. The first four are commercial databases that pull together
information from a variety of sources: telephone companies, government public records, credit header
reports and self-reported consumer. Cell phone and other hard to get numbers are sometimes available.
In addition to information on your subject, you might find neighbors, relatives, others at the same address,
property records, court records, FAA registrations, bankruptcy filings and more.

partial). (Most records do not have an SSN, so be sure to search by other criteria to find all
records for your subject.)
UCC filings (may include the SSN)
Bankruptcy (may include the SSN)

4. General biographical background

INTERNET
Here are several ways to determine if someone has an internet presence such as a web page, a
resume, authored an article, mentioned on a site, has contributed to a news group, or has an
email address. Email, domain registrants, and group postings are hard to find.
•

•
•
•
•

Whois – http://www.netsol.com/cgi-bin/whois/whois To find the owner of a web site, enter
the url here. Owners can opt to keep their contact information private, so this is not
comprehensive.
Accurint's Internet Domain search. Not comprehensive
Google groups can be searched to find postings
Internet Address Finder http://www.iaf.net/frames/freeresources.htm for email addresses.
In testings, it found few listings, and many were out of date. But it does sometime return at
least a city name, which might be useful.
Search Engine tips: Reverse order of name: “lastname firstname” (for possible lastname,
firstname entries), LastnameFirstname (no space in the middle), deliberately misspell name.
ARCHIVES:

•

Check the archives of the papers covering the areas where your subject has lived. Also
check any industry publications s/he might be mentioned in. Don't know what papers are
online? Go to http://www.ibiblio.org/slanews/internet/archives.html for listings by state.

Court Records Overview
(Criminal and Civil - Federal and State)
There are two kinds of courts in the U.S: Federal and State. Each of these is further divided,
based on the type of case (criminal, bankruptcy, civil etc.) and the structure of the relevant state
system. For a brief overview, refer to Understanding the Federal Courts ,
http://www.uscourts.gov/understand02/ . Consult one of the BRB books listed in the
RESOURCES section, or visit your state's main judicial site for more information
There is no central repository for all court records. They are scattered in courthouses and offices
across the nation. Some are online, but many are not, requiring an in-person search. The online
records, produced by different organizations, differ from each other in format, the information they
contain, and inclusion dates. There are services that claim to perform nationwide searches by
normalizing this information in their database but their databases hold only a fraction of the
records available, and have limited search or identification options..
Except for federal cases (more about that below) the most practical way to look for criminal or
civil cases is to concentrate on the counties in which your subject lived.

13. FEDERAL COURT RECORDS:
Consists of the U.S. Supreme Court, the Circuit Courts of Appeal, District Courts, Bankruptcy
Courts and a few specialized courts. Encompasses both criminal and civil cases
• PACER (stands for Public Access to Court Electronic Records) –
http://pacer.psc.uscourts.gov Inexpensive access to Federal records. Historically limited
to docket information, but full case documents are becoming more common. Parties’
identification information is stripped. Most states are included, although there are
exceptions. Ex: South Dakota’s criminal court is excluded.
There are two ways to search PACER: through a nationwide index (U.S. Party/Case
Index) or through the individual court. Before using the index, check the listing of
participating courts - there are some that are not included.
•
Federal Bureau of Prisons http://www.bop.gov Contains current inmates and those
released since 1982, but entries are sometimes quirky (no first name, just initial) and no
unique identifiers (SSN or DOB or address). Data updated daily.
• Lexis PACER data is available through other vendors, such as LexisNexis. It’s more
expensive, but there are some advantages, such as field searching.
• Findlaw: http://www.findlaw.com/casecode/ for links to federal courts.
• Federal sanctions, such as exclusion from federal contracts, Medicaid and Medicare
actions, defaulted health Education Assistance Loans, NASD disciplinary actions, and
SEC sanctions are available on web sites of the specific agency Lexis .

14. STATE COURT RECORDS
Many state courts systems are divided this way: Supreme, Appeals, Superior and County. (where
you find most arrest records). There are sometimes specialized courts for juveniles, divorces,
business, probate etc.
In most cases, online records consist of only the docket sheet. This is
the index to the materials - not the case documents themselves. A trip to the courthouse (or a
call to the lawyer or the court) is usually necessary.
Civil cases are usually the most difficult to find because typically there’s very little identification
attached to the record.
NATIONWIDE STATE COURT RECORD VENDORS (Online)
These vendors have much coverage overlap. State-level information (Inmates, Sex Offenders) is more
common than county. Unless noted, case information relates to dockets. The number of states covered by each
service changes frequently and may not be up to date.
•
Accurint - Department of Corrections records for 36 states, criminal court records for 21
states (entire or partial), arrest logs for counties in four states. Certain civil records are
available for nine states and parts of four others.
• AutoTrack - Criminal offenders from 45 states (incl. D.C.), court records from 9 (full and
partial)
• Courtlink/CaseStream – http://www.courtlink.com Affiliated with LexisNexis. Access to
all or parts of 30-plus states' court records (arrest, prison, civil etc.) E-mail alerts about
new case filings, automatic case tracking and courthouse retrieval service
• Lexis-Nexis – http://www.lexisnexis.com Case law advanced searching available.
• MerlinData - 38 states, in full or in part.
• Rapsheets - http://www.legaldockets.com/ Criminal information and sex offenders from
approximately 40 states (full or partial). Need date of birth and Social Security number to
search. For a free test account, call Camille Gamble at 901-528-5265.
• PublicData .com http://publicdata.com/ An inexpensive offshore service. Arrest and
prison records for 37 states.

COURT DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL SERVICES (Courthouse visits):
Sometimes you need to examine the actual documents - not just the online docket sheet.
Sometimes not even the docket sheet is online. In these cases, the courthouse is the only place
these documents are available. Sometimes a lawyer involved in your case can help out by
sending them to you. It’s also worth a try to call a clerk at the courthouse. If they can’t do it they
might have someone to recommend.
Here are other alternatives:
•

•

•
•

Visit BRB to find a list of national and local document retrieval firms: (click on Record
Vendors, then Sources and Search Firms) http://www.brbpub.com/pubrecsites.asp ( BRB’s
book, Local Court and County Record Retrievers is another option.) Quality, price and
turnaround time vary widely among these companies. Make sure you understand exactly
what you need and what's available before you contact one of them.
Larry Lopez recommends National Document Filing & Retrieving Inc., 800 829-5578 ("not
cheap but has proved reliable and is not as expensive as another good firm Parasec"). The
number for Parasec is 800 533-7272.
Larry also suggests trying law firm paralegals, public defenders or newspaper contacts
instead of retrieval firms.
Andrew Zimmerman (Zimmerman's Research Guide)
http://www.lexisone.com/zimmermanguide/#l recommends the firm Washington Document
Retrieval Service (800-728-5201), and for bankruptcy, FDR/Disclosure (800-874-4337)

15. Liens and Bankruptcy

•
•
•

Liens used to secure business loans can be found in UCC (Uniform Commercial Code)
filings.
Tax liens can be found in state or federal courts.
Mechanics (contractor) liens are filed in state civil records.
Bankruptcy suits are filed in the relevant Federal court.
