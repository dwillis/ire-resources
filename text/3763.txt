Project Checklist

Here’s my 10-point checklist for enterprise projects – stories that I choose to do. There are some
stories that are so important or timely that a checklist is irrelevant or misguided. But for
discretionary projects – ideas that begin from scratch – I find this checklist a failsafe compass:

Is it new?
* Can I bring a new twist to a familiar topic?
* Can I expose the truth of a popular belief?
Is there potential for change or reform?
* Is there a problem that needs corrected?
* Is there a reasonable or commonsense solution?
Can the issue be quantified?
* Can I specifically track the core issue with documents or data?
* Can I make specific findings?
Will readers care?
* Is the story relevant to readers – can I make them care?
* What are the thematic nut graphs?
Are there on-the-record victims to bring the story to life?
* Can I give voice to the story?
* Can I obtain visuals to go with the words?
Why this story, why now?
* Is this a topic that fits my region?
* Are we the worst or perceived as the best?
Is the minimum story good enough?
* If everything falls apart, what do I have?
Is there a unique source of new information?
* Do I have a whistleblower or new source with unreported information?
* Do I have a cache of unique records or data, or a way to craft a new twist?
Can I describe the story in six words or less?
* Example: Healthcare practitioners sexually prey on patients
* Example: Profiteers exploit and abuse the aged
Do I care?
* Is this a topic that I believe is important? Follow your gut.
