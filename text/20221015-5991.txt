Reporting
Narrative writing starts with narrative reporting. Do your research and identify possible
opportunities to do immersion reporting and witness scenes for your story.
Do your “get all the info” interview ​before​ these immersion reporting sessions when you
can. That way, you know what to key in on, and can avoid asking questions that interrupt
the scene.
Start the interview with, “I may ask you some weird questions, because I am going to try
to get a sense of what it looked like, felt like, even smelled like to be there.”
Work chronologically. Start at the beginning of the year or even day. What time did your
alarm go off?
The best questions: What did that feel like? How did you know? Can you describe that
for me? What were you doing right before that happened? Why is that?
Detail questions: What color was your shirt? Which kind of car did you drive? Why did
you choose that one? What time did your alarm clock go off? What were you expecting
instead of that? What was your facial expression? “What’s the name of the dog?
Do your research, but don’t be afraid to be the dumbest person in the room (or at least
play dumb). Asking simple questions gets the best answers.
Ask the subject to tell a story: “Can you tell me about …?” “Do you remember the
moment … What was that like?”
Allow for long pauses. This is when your best material comes.
Be a human. You are asking sensitive questions. Say, “I am so sorry this happened to
you” and “I appreciate how hard this must be to talk about.” It doesn’t make you any less
of a journalist.
Be transparent. Narratives often focus on people not used to being the subjects of
journalism. Explain what you are doing and what the impact could be on their lives.
Look to documents for additional narrative details. Can be public - court records, divorce
records in some states - or private - ask your subject to see yearbooks, letters. Lisa once
wrote a kicker off a drawing someone had made.
Take pictures or shoot video. They can help later when you are writing,
Writing
Write like you’d tell the story to a friend. What jumps out without opening your notebook?
How would you start the story?
Sum up the theme of the story in a word or phrase. Everything you include should push
the theme forward.
Create a timeline. Even if you are not writing chronologically, it can help focus a complex
story. A map c
When in doubt, write chronologically.

Make your beginnings and endings as strong as possible. The lede should grab and set
up the story/theme; the kicker should stay with the reader. End sentences on the
strongest thought. End scenes with a cliffhanger that leads to the next one.
Think of storytelling techniques. Narratives have conflict, rising action, a climax and
resolution.
Cut as many adjectives and adverbs as possible. Use muscular verbs. Let the facts you
reported set the scene.
Choose your details for a reason. What do they say about the character or the story?
Read your story aloud. Listen to the rhythm of your sentences and the flow of your
sections.
