Learning About Python
Basic Concepts
• Python runs on anything: Windows, Apple, Linux, Unix, even cell phones.
• Whitespace (indentation) matters. The standard is 4 spaces - tab characters tend to
make experienced programmers testy.
• Everything in Python is an object. Everything. That means everything can be used and
reused elsewhere and can have attributes.
• Even though Python is an object-oriented language, you don’t have to employ OOP
techniques unless you want to (and you will want to eventually).
• Most of the tools you’ll need are included in Python’s standard library (a library is like a
Perl module). However, there are many libraries you can use.

Python Objects
• Strings - “hello, world” is a string.
• Lists - collections of strings, numbers and other data. [‘hello’, ‘world’, 3] is a list.
• Tuples - an immutable list. (‘hello’, ‘world’, 3) is a tuple.

Basic Tasks
• Text processing. Python’s string and re libraries can slice and process text very well.
• Web processing. urllib and htmllib handle the retrieval of web pages.
