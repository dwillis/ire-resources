INVESTIGATIVE MATCHING

How to cross disparate databases and uncover hidden truths
Our case study:
When we began looking into
New Jersey's home healthcare industry,
we quickly turned up anecdotal
evidence suggesting that the state was
licensing criminals to care for the
elderly and disabled.
What we didn't know was the
scope of the problem -- were these
anecdotes merely isolated examples?
Or was there a more widespread
systemic problem?
To answer the question, we
obtained a database of licensed home
health aides and a second database of
New Jersey criminal court proceedings.
We ran a series of "matching" queries
that tied licensed aides to criminal
convictions. We found more than 100.
After fighting for, and winning,
additional information about the aides,
we ran our queries again and found
about 100 more aides who had been
convicted.
This CAR work enabled us to
assure readers that the cases we wrote
about in great detail were not aberrant,
and couldn't be dismissed as such. In
reaction to our stories, New Jersey
initiated comprehensive criminal
background testing for home health
aides.
Matching considerations:
Before you touch a computer,
it's really important to think through
the journalistic aspects of your
matching project, giving special
attention to the parameters of your
match.
Many matching stories are
similar to ours in that they pair up a
database of criminals with a database
of a crucial profession -- day care
providers, teachers, bus drivers, etc.

Others tie campaign contributors to lists
of state contractors, firearms-prohibited
felons to licensed hunters, and voter
registration lists to other address
databases (to see if voters really live
where they're registered).
No matter what you match, you
have to think about fairness first, and
establish rules that will produce hits
only when these journalistically relevant
conditions are met.
While it might seem pretty clean
cut that schools should not be
employing sex offenders, there are
some gray areas. Sticking with
criminals, for example, you might ask:

Is it fair to pull out all matching criminal
cases or just certain offenses? Try to
look at the matter as dispassionately as
possible. Does your community care
how many teachers have received
speeding tickets? Probably not. But if
you're matching speeding tickets with
school bus drivers, then you're
measuring something important

What's the time period you want to
examine? The legal system has rules

for determining when a convict has
paid a debt to society. So should you. If
you're using criminal data, you have to
be careful about looking back too far
into a person's past. A bus driver with
five tickets in the last three years would
probably be of more interest to your
readers than a driver who had five
tickets 10 years ago but none since.
Getting Technical -- Obtaining
Data
Now here's the tricky part.
Don't worry -- it's not TOO
tricky. But investigative matching can

get pretty complicated, and you
shouldn't promise an editor that you
can turn around a matching story for
tomorrow's paper. Remember, we're
usually talking about finding matches
in databases that were not designed to
go together. That means we have to
force the issue a bit here.
To have any chance of matching
at all, you need each of your databases
to have a piece of information in
common. Usually, for these types of
stories, both databases will have names
of individuals, and you can design a
query that links the two databases on a
common name.
But a name isn't the best field
to use in investigative matching. Names
are far from unique -- there are 39
James Smiths registered to vote in
Bergen County, NJ, for example. How's
your computer going to tell them all
apart?
And what if the person is listed
as Jim Smith in one database and
James Smith in the other? The
computer's going to miss that match.
Social Security Numbers are
ideal, because they are unique, but
what are the chances of you getting
two disparate databases with social
security numbers?
Usually, investigative matchers
rely on some combination of name
matching, date-of-birth matching and
address matching to do the job.
And there's sometimes a good
amount of data "cleaning" involved.
One database may have last and first
names separated, while the other might
have them together as one field. You'll
probably want to break apart the full
name field into pieces so you can
compare last name with last name and
first name with first name.
If there's a golden rule to keep
in mind, it would be: Make sure you

think about what fields you're going to

match and make sure you get them
when you request your data from the
government agency.

For our home health project, we
were handicapped when state
bureaucrats decided to redact DOB
data from the database of licensed
aides. More on the consequences
below…
Getting Technical -- Making it
happen
So you've got two data sets.
You've got some fields in common.
Now what?
Well, there are two strategies
you can try, what IRE member Paul
Adrian has dubbed "going wide" and
"going tight".

Going Tight: If you're working
on a project and expect a lot of
matches, or if you're lucky enough to
have good matching fields, then you
might want to start with a tight match.
This simply means running a query
based on an exact match between two
or more key fields -- such as last name,
address and DOB. If you get a match
on all three, you can feel pretty
confident about the results. Life is
good.
Going Wide: This strategy
involves casting as wide a net as
possible and then going over the
results to pick out the good hits from
the mistakes. It is also often your only
choice, because you often don't have
enough common data in the two
databases to go tight. Going wide
usually means a lot of work, but the
work will be well worth it if you turn up
something important.
In our project, we were saddled
with data that wasn't very conducive to
matching. For our licensed aides, we
had the name and address of each

license holder. On the criminal side, we
were working with two databases -- a
database of people charged with crimes
and a database of people sentenced.
Both had names, of course, but each
had only partial address information.
The sentencing data had a DOB for
each individual, but that wasn't of
immediate use because New Jersey
authorities had stripped the DOB out of
the aides database.
So I went wide. I set-up a query
that matched on the last name and the
first three letters of the first name (first
three letters solves many first name
problems -- it matches ron with ronald,
jon with jonathan, etc.). I also captured
the partial address information from the
criminal data and the complete
information from the database of aides,
and had this information listed in the
results of the query.
This produced a list of several
thousand potential hits. We then
eyeballed the results, keeping cases
that were likely to be good matches
and throwing out obvious mistakes.
Rich Smith of Mahwah (northern border
of New Jersey) crossed with Ricardo
Smith of Cape May (southern border)
was deleted. Any unusual names that
matched, and any name-address
matches we kept.
Then the real work began. To
ultimately confirm our matches,
reporters Tom Zambito and Mary Jo
Layton went into courthouses around
the state and pulled data out of the
paper files, data that wasn't included
in the electronic database. We obtained
complete address information from the
criminal files to compare with the
address of the aide in question. We
also looked in the docket for any
reference to the defendant being a
home health aide in the case narrative.
Which brings me to one final
area of discussion…

The Body Count
As you get involved in
investigative matching, you'll quickly
find yourself obsessed with one statistic
-- the number of matches you make. Of
course, that's one of the main reasons
for doing investigative matching -- you
want to see how many elements of
database A are in database B.
Your editors will likely be even
more interested They'll want the hit
count to be as high as possible,
because big numbers make for better
headlines.
Well, here's why bigger isn't
necessarily better. It's not worse -- just
not always better.
The primary goal of most
investigative matching stories is to
prove a point, not to generate precise
statistical measures. And often you can
prove a point just as well with 50
examples as with 500.
This isn't true for all cases, of
course, but it's definitely something to
keep in mind when planning a matching
project.
Also, some news organizations
are content go directly from computer
to project and report the number of
hits with little verification.
Obviously, you don't want to do
this if you're naming names. And
secondly, you should at least try some
secondary measure of verification to
make sure your data or your technique
wasn't flawed in some way.
