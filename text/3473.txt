` Official “races”:

◦ White
◦ Black or African American
◦ Asian
◦ Native American
◦ Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander
◦ Other race

` Hispanic origin is separate

` Since 2000, it is possible to be multi-racial

` Simple change (growth or decline) in numbers
` Segregation index
` Diversity index

` Easy to calculate (duh!)

` Look at both raw numbers and percentage

change
` Story ideas:

◦ Change over time
◦ Majority minority
◦ Changing neighborhoods: “Little Italy” becomes
“Chinatown”

` Simple concept: Chance that two people

picked at random are “different”
` Created by Phil Meyer and Shawn McIntosh of
USA Today in 1990; updated in 2000 by
Meyer and Paul Overberg
` Produces a number ranging from 0% to 100%
(at least theoretically)
` Can be used at any geographical scale
(neighborhoods up to the nation)

` Simple case hypothetical example

x Population is 80% non-Hispanic white and 20% Black

` Probability of first pick being white: .80

` Probability of both being white: .8*.8=.64
` Probability of both being Black: .2*.2=.04

` Probability of two of same race: .64+.04=.68
` Probability of two different: 1-.68=.32
` Diversity index is 32%

` Need to account for five races and two

ethnicity possibilities
` “Other race” is ignored
` Multi-racial is diverse by definition
` Diversity = 1-((W2 + B2 + AmIndI2 + A2+PI2) *
(H2 + Non-H2 ))
` Use the Diversity Index Calculator from
USAToday at http://www.ire.org/census/

` Concept is less simple: How well mixed are the

people within a geographical area?
` Based on the Gini coefficient, which is used to
measure income inequality
` Compares two groups: X and non-X
` Produces a number between 0 and 100

◦ 0 is perfect integration: Every neighborhood has same
mix as overall city
◦ 100 is perfect segregation: Every neighborhood is 100%
X or 100% non-X

` Interpret as % who would have to move to achieve

integration

` In each tract, calculate #of whites in tract by

total whites in city; same for non-whites
` Subtract the two numbers and get the
absolute value (i.e., make negatives positive)
` Add up all those absolute values
` Divide the total by 2
` Multiply by 100

` Calculate for different groups:

White/nonWhite; Black/nonBlack; etc.
` Note that the index is sensitive to level of
geography; the smaller the unit used for
“neighborhood”, the more apparent
segregation
