What is corporate fraud?
A few kinds of corporate fraud
•Securities fraud
• Ripping off investors
•Consumer fraud
• Ripping off customers
•Tax fraud
• Ripping off taxpayers (that’s you)

One definition:
“Business fraud is, very simply,
fraud in any business activity that
resorts to deceitful practices to
cause economic injury.”
-- Cochran law firm (plaintiffs’
attorneys)

Bottom line:
Fraud boils down to to saying one thing and doing another, for
profit.

Caveat reporter
•

No one red flag always indicates fraud.

•

Not every example that raises eyebrows
amounts to fraud.

•

Michelle Leder’s “mosaic”
principle.

•

Talk to the company.

Basics: The Filings
Key points:
•Mostly publicly traded companies
•Limited regulatory review
•Disclosure, not substance
•Dense, complex and long.
Where to find them
•SEC’s Edgar database: http://1.usa.gov/1f3TpOM
How to use them:
•Reynolds Center’s SEC filing primers: http://bit.ly/1f3Tt0P

Get a grip: The 10s
Primary financial and operational disclosures for established
public companies.

10-K
•Annual
•Audited
•Comprehensive
10-Q
•Quarterly (3x a year)
•Unaudited
•More incremental

The Verified Life
Check out:
•Education, especially:
• Prof’l Licenses: State Licensing Boards, esp. M.D.
• Diploma mills (http://tinyurl.com/brudsjy)
•Military
• DOD Form DD-214 (FOIA)
• Discharge (honorable or ?), tours of duty, “special forces”
•Litigation
• Corporate & Governmental/Regulatory (esp. Fin. Execs!)
• Personal (prof’l “character”: repeated litigation w/ excolleagues, stiffing creditors when affluent)

The Ties That Bind
Red flags: Listed in Proxy (DEF 14a), often 10-K’s too
•Look for: financial & personal relationships in/around business
• Related party transactions that baffle: offshore LLCs
• Material addition to exec. compensation
• Company assumes liability but exec. retains profit
• Company provides basic legal, accounting support
• Companies buying basic/commodity goods from RP’s
Bottom Line: Look for “One Way” relationship between Corp. &
executives

Ties That Bind: Family Affair
Curious:
•“The father of Mr. Dimon has been employed by the Firm
as a broker since 2009, and for 2012 received
compensation of $1,599,616, including annual salary,
commissions, and an equity award.” — JPMorgan Chase
proxy (2013)
Still…
•That’s up from $447,000 in 2011.
•He earned $505,324 last year and $576,951 in 2013

Ties That Bind: Map Quest
“In December 2008, the Company purchased an extensive
collection of historical maps of the American Southwest from
[Chairman & CEO] McClendon for $12.1 million, which
represented his cost. A dealer who had assisted Mr. McClendon
in acquiring this collection over a period of six years advised the
Company that the replacement value of the collection in
December 2008 exceeded the purchase price by more than $8
million. The maps have been displayed at the Company’s
Oklahoma City headquarters for a number of years, during which
the Company has been insuring the maps in exchange for their
display. ... Our employees and visitors appreciate the maps …
The Company was interested in continuing to have use of
the map collection and believed it was not appropriate to
continue to rely on cost-free loans of artwork …” — 2009

Ties That Bind: Buried Treasure
Aubrey K. McClendon, Chesapeake Energy

•$2.9 million in salary & bonus
•$16.8 million in stock
•$875,000+ in perks for 2010, including
• $500,000 in personal jet flights
• $375,702 of “other” perks, including:
“$250,000 for the costs related to personal accounting
support provided to Mr. McClendon by our employees, net
of reimbursement, and (ii) $119,135 for personal security
provided to Mr. McClendon and his family.”

Filings: What to look for
(Generally)
• Frequent reshuffling
• Strategies
• Core products & services
• Poor acknowledgement of costs or risks
• Repeated stock issuance (dilution)
• Unexplained & poorly explained capital raises

Measuring up: Financials
The basics:
•Income statement
• Profit & loss
• Revenue (sales)
• Net income (earnings)
•Balance Sheet
• Assets & liabilities
•Cash-Flow
• Circulatory system
Other resources:
•Reynolds Center 10-Q financial basics: http://bit.ly/1jskFFp
•Mark Tatge’s “Funny Money: How companies play games with
numbers”: http://slidesha.re/1jsjG8c

Measuring up: Receivables
Accounts receivable
Money owed to the company, generally by customers
•Big swings
• in dollar terms
• as a percent of revenue
•Collectibility (Judgement call—theirs)
•Concentration of risk
• Risk factors
•Footnotes
• Rising A/R should mean rising delinquencies, i.e. amounts
past due for 90+ days
• Or company may be hiding uncollectable sales

Measuring up: Payables
Accounts payable
Money the company owes, generally to suppliers
•Profitable company with rapidly increasing A/P
• Implies the company may not be paying its bills

Bottom line:
•It’s all relative
• 3% increase in revenues…
• but what’s happening with net income, receivables, etc.?
•It’s about change over time
• Big spikes? Sudden drops?
•Check the details:
• Has the change been disclosed? Related party?

Measuring up: Gaming Sales
Sales are supposed to be recorded in the quarter that the
goods/services are delivered if payment is likely to be received.
Possible games:
•Recognizing sales too soon
• “Accelerating” sales made early one quarter so they count
for the prior quarter
• Recognizing multi-year contracts all at once

•Recognizing sales too late
• Recording them early the following quarter, if this quarter is
already going well (AKA smoothing earnings)

Measuring up: Cookie jars
Reserves account for expected future costs:
•Some percentage of customers won’t pay their bills.
•Inventories become obsolete, spoil or otherwise lose value.
Reserve math
•Establishing a reserve reduces income (profits).
•Reversing part or all of a reserve increases income (profits)
• On paper

Cookie-jar accounting
•“Releasing” reserves to generate income
•Artificially inflating reserves for later release

Measuring up: More fun
Manipulating expenses
• Worldcom & capitalizing operating expense
Manipulating inventories
• Spiking inventory value, esp. coupled with big borrowing
Rearranging deck chairs
• new segments  hard to compare over time

Endless adjustments
• updates  uncertain accounting?
Ballooning debt with little financial growth to show for it

Measuring up: Bottom line
Big swings?

Bigger questions.

The Vitals: Cash Flow
• Cash from Operations: $ in/out from biz ops
• Cash from Financing: $ from stock/bond sales
• Cash from Investments: $ from sale/investment in PPE

The Vitals:Cash Flow
Companies that can’t generate cash from operations over
time have to rely on financing; the problem there is
that this gets more expensive and markets seize. Cash flow
problems are at the core of many gimmicks and frauds.
