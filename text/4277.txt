Foreword
This publication represents a compilation of state laws governing public records. Designed to allow access to
governmental documents while protecting privacy rights and maintaining public safety, open records statutes
vary from state to state. The format of this publication is intended to outline the key aspects of public records
laws and facilitate comparisons between each state.
The National Association of Counties published this report to serve as a reference tool for county officials
charged with keeping public records. The information found in this guide reflects the statutes as of the date of
this publication.
*Connecticut and Rhode Island are omitted from this report, as neither has counties with elected governing
boards.

National Association of Counties • Open Records Laws: A State by State Report •December 2010

Introduction
Governmental agencies and officials generate data,
information, and documents related to public
functions. Certain materials are required to be kept
by law while others are simply created in the course
of an organization’s operations. Though Congress did
not enact the Freedom of Information Act, which
applies to federal government documents, until
1966, most states already had statutes regulating the
release of public records. These vary in length from
a few paragraphs to a few dozen pages. Some states’
constitutions create a constitutional right to access
open records. This publication summarizes several
components of each state’s open records law.
The information is presented in a parallel structure
designed to enable comparisons among states’
statutes. Specific judicial decisions or opinions of the
states’ attorneys general are cited when case law or
opinions guide states’ open records practices where
the language of the law left room for interpretation.1
The general format of each summary is as follows:
• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ Some states place restrictions on who is
allowed to request access to public records.
These limitations generally apply to those
who:
▶▶ Are incarcerated,
▶▶ Are not a citizen of the state,
▶▶ Are not a citizen of the United States,

or

▶▶ Are not of majority age.
◈◈ Certain statutes define the term

“person” or “individual” to include
corporations, firms, associations, and
other forms of organizations.

○○ Many states’ open records laws do not allow

individuals to request materials for certain
purposes or limit the subsequent use of

1 This publication used the Open Government Guide
published by The Reporters Committee for Freedom
of the Press in conjunction with states’ official websites
and other sources to provide an accurate and up-to-date
compilation of common law practices and statutory
guidelines relating to public records.

6 • National Association of Counties

public records. Some of these regulated
purposes include:
▶▶ Commercial purposes,
▶▶ Political purposes, and
▶▶ Litigation purposes.

• Whose and which records are covered under the
law:
○○ Each statute defines the entities which are
subject to its provisions slightly differently.
○○ Every statute applies to the executive

branch overall, though some exclude the
office of the governor of the state or certain
executive functions.

○○ Likewise, no state exempts the legislative

branch in its entirety, though the state
legislature is sometimes subject to other
rules or procedures.

○○ The

judiciary branch is occasionally
exempt and is instead subject to common
law practices or constitutional provisions
that open its records to the public.

○○ Non-governmental entities which receive

public funding or have public officials as
members are subject to some states’ open
records acts.

○○ Multi-state or regional bodies and advisory

boards or commissions are sometimes
addressed within the statutes. Otherwise,
the courts rule as to whether these entities
must disclose records relating to public
functions.

○○ States’ statutes also define the term “public

records” in different manners.

▶▶ The format or physical characteristics of

the requested record is rarely relevant to
the openness of that record.

○○ Typically all records open for inspection

are available for copying. A few provisions
allow custodians to prevent the copying of
any record deemed too fragile to be handled
or too large to be copied feasibly.

• Fees and costs:
○○ Some public records laws create a schedule
of fees or establish a maximum fee that
custodians may charge for providing copies
of public records.
○○ Nearly every state’s laws require public

agencies to charge no more than the
actual cost of providing copies of public
records. These costs may be comprised of
one or more of the following components,
depending on the statutory provisions:
▶▶ Actual costs of direct materials used,
▶▶ The cost of mailing copies of records to

the requester,

▶▶ Overhead

costs associated
providing copies, and

with

▶▶ Personnel costs incurred in providing

copies of records.

◈◈ Often personnel costs may only be

charged if the request is for a tailored
format or requires a substantial
amount of a public employee’s time
to compile the record or segregate
confidential information from the
public portions requested.

○○ Several laws allow custodians to require

advance payment if the fee is likely to
exceed a specified amount.

○○ Agencies are not generally allowed to

charge individuals for the right to inspect
records during normal business hours.

○○ Fee waivers or reductions may be granted

at the discretion of the custodian in many
states. Some statutes require fees be waived
under certain circumstances.

○○ Most

statutes stipulate that the fees
established within the open records laws do
not supersede any other statutory provisions
dictating the charges for copies of public
records.

• Enforcement and sanctions:
○○ Most public records laws prescribe a
procedure for appealing denials of requests
for records. Appeals must be filed with
courts of specific jurisdictions and within a
certain time frame.

○○ The attorney general or an ombudsman

may play a role in enforcement, though in
many states, requesters must pursue action
on their own behalf. Some state agencies
may have administrative processes to
mediate disputes.

○○ Court-imposed sanctions outlined within

open records statutes may include:
▶▶ Attorneys’

fees to
prevailing plaintiff,

a

substantially

▶▶ Actual damages or punitive damages,
▶▶ Civil fines against the public agency or

custodian, and

▶▶ Criminal sanctions including fines or

imprisonment.

○○ In accordance with the presumption of

openness established by legislative intent
and judicial interpretation of states’ laws,
public agencies bear the burden of proving
that a requested record is exempt from
disclosure.

• Exemptions:
○○ All public records laws include specific
exemptions which apply to certain types
of records, while some also contain general
exemptions to protect the public interest or
prevent invasion of privacy.
○○ Most laws enable custodians to utilize

discretion to encourage a higher level of
disclosure when appropriate or feasible.

○○ Often the number of exemptions is too

great to list all of them. This report offers a
few examples of categories of records which
are exempt in each state and provides
the information necessary to find other
exemptions listed within the open records
law.

○○ Each act expressly exempts other records

deemed confidential by federal or state
statute. Again, this report includes a few
examples and directs the reader to where
more information may be found.

○○ Following the presumption of openness,

courts have instructed agencies to construe
exemptions narrowly to favor maximum
disclosure.

Open Records Laws: A State by State Report •December 2010 • 7

▶▶ Often courts will look to the federal

Freedom of Information Act to guide
their interpretation of exemptions
contained in the state’s counterpart.

○○ Most open records laws require custodians

to segregate the confidential portions
of information from otherwise public
documents. Public agencies are typically,
though not always, required to bear the
burden of the costs associated with this
process.

• Electronic Records:
○○ As the format of public information is
generally immaterial, public records laws
apply to electronic records, as well.
▶▶ E-mail is often treated as any other

document, depending on the nature of
its content.

▶▶ Software

is often exempt due to
proprietary or security-related reasons.

○○ Certain provisions require custodians to

produce electronic records in other formats
upon request. However, custodians are not
usually required to produce new records by
compiling or analyzing information.

8 • National Association of Counties

○○ Fees for access to electronic records are

generally subject to the same limits as other
forms of records, though the direct costs
may include programming costs or other
costs associated with maintaining records
in electronic format.

• Money-Making:
○○ Public agencies, unless otherwise provided
by statute, may not generally charge more
than the actual cost of providing copies of
public records and do not profit from the
sale of records.
○○ Private use of public information may or

may not be restricted by states’ statutes
or court orders. In some states, agencies
may charge more for providing records of
commercial value which are requested for
commercial purposes.

Frequently Used Terms
The definitions of the following terms as they apply to open records practices may be helpful to the reader.

Alabama
Public Records Law
Codes: Ala. Code § 36-12-40 (Supp. 2005)
Relevant Court Cases: Excise Commissioner of
Citronelle v. State ex rel. Skinner, 179 Ala. 654, 60
So. 812 (Ala. 1912); Stone v. Consolidated Publishing
Co., 404 So. 2d 678 (1981); Chambers v. Birmingham
News Co., 552 So. 2d 854 (Ala. 1989); Birmingham
Education Ass’n v. Birmingham City Bd. of Educ., CV
4-637 at 2-3 (Cir. Ct. of Jefferson County, Ala., Nov.
15, 1995); Walsh v. Barnes, 541 So. 2d 33, 35 (Ala.
Civ. App. 1989); Blankenship v. City of Hoover, 590
So. 2d 245 (Ala. 1991); Scott v. Culpepper, 220 Ala.
393, 393, 125 So. 643, 643 (1930)
Prior to 1923, only common law precedence offered
the public access to certain records once the
requester demonstrated a qualified interest. The
first public records law codified the public’s right
to inspect and copy documents and has since been
amended twice – once in 1983 and again in 2004 – to
specify exemptions. Alabama’s Public Records Law
today is a relatively short, sweeping statement found
in Section 36-12-40 of the Alabama Code. Due to
its brevity and lack of detail, the Alabama Supreme
Court has played a significant role in defining
exemptions. Grounds for exclusion, however, are
narrowly construed and favor disclosure.
• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ Every citizen has a right to access public
records. Because not otherwise stated in
the law itself, the term “citizens” likely
refers to all citizens of the United States.
This includes news media, corporations,
and professional organizations.
▶▶ Court rulings have determined that the

state is not explicitly required to mail
public records to prisoners.1

○○ The custodian of public records may ask

the purpose for a request or the requester’s
intended use of the records. The law,
however, does not provide exemption to
disclosure based on the purpose or intended
use of any request.

1 Person v. State Dep’t of Forensic Sciences, 721 So. 2d
203 (Ala. Civ. App. 1998).

12 • National Association of Counties

▶▶ The Alabama Supreme Court has ruled

that records may not be requested when
“the purpose is purely speculative or
from idle curiosity.”2 Media interest,
however, is a legitimate purpose and not
classified as “idle curiosity.”

▶▶ The language of the law does not prevent

requests for commercial purposes, either.
The legitimacy of seeking public records
for profit has been upheld through court
decisions.3

• Whose and which records are covered under the
law:
○○ Alabama Code § 36-12-2 (2001) states
that “[a]ll public officers and servants shall
correctly make and accurately keep…all
such books or sets of books, documents,
files, papers, letters and copies of letters…
in reference to the activities or business
required to be done…”
○○ Under the Public Records Law, “[e]very

public officer having the custody of a
public writing which a citizen has a right to
inspect is bound to give him, on demand, a
certified copy of it, on payment of the legal
fees therefor.”4
▶▶ The Public Records Law therefore covers

the executive, legislative, and judicial
branches of the state government.

▶▶ It has also been applied by the courts

to various city, county, municipal, and
state personnel, departments, boards,
and commissions.

▶▶ Along with court decisions, the state

attorney general’s opinions have applied
the law to the Circuit court clerk,
County probate judge; State, county
circuit, and municipal courts; County
circuit court register’s office; County

1989).
4 Ala. Code § 36-12-41 (2001).

district court clerk’s office; and probate
judge’s office.
▶▶ Whether

non-governmental bodies
which receive public funding or have
public officials as members are subject
to the Public Records Law has remained
unaddressed by the courts and the law
itself.

• Enforcement and sanctions:
○○ The Public Records Law does not prescribe
enforcement procedures. It is primarily
enforced by private citizens or news media
through civil action in court.

○○ The term “public writing” that appears in

in enforcement only in a case in which
someone tampers with public records.

the Public Records Law has been interpreted
to include the definition of “public records”
according to Alabama Code § 41-13-1
(2000). In essence, all written and typed
materials made by public officials in the
course of conducting public business are
subject to the law.
▶▶ The Supreme Court has extended this

definition to include audio-visual and
computerized data, as well.

▶▶ Interpretations have broadly defined the

scope and type of materials subject to
the law in favor of maximum disclosure.

○○ All records open to inspection are available

for copying.

• Fees and costs:
○○ The Public Records Law allows public
agencies to charge for providing records to
the public but does not establish a schedule
of fees.
○○ The attorney general has issued opinions

suggesting nominal fees should be
charged when budget constraints prevent
agencies from offering free access and that
personnel costs should only be recovered
through fees if the search for documents
and reproduction consumed a substantial
amount of an employee’s time.

○○ Specific

fees relating to duplication
services provided by the courts have been
established through orders and procedural
rules. For example,
▶▶ Fees levied by the Alabama Criminal

Justice Information Center (ACJIC) may
not exceed $25.5

▶▶ Fees levied by the Department of Public

Safety records may not to exceed $15

for each record or report, unless other
statutes dictate otherwise.6

Ala. Code § 41-9-644 (2000).

○○ The attorney general may play a role

▶▶ There is no ombudsman or specific

agency charged with enforcement.

○○ Sanctions for nondisclosure when the law

demands it are not addressed by the law,
though attorney’s fees have been awarded
in at least one case.7

• Exemptions:
○○ The Public Records Law provides two
specific and two general exemptions, all of
which are mandatory.
○○ Specific exemptions:

1. Records regarding use of public libraries
are exempt from disclosure.
2. Information related to security and safety
which, if released, may “reasonably be
expected to be detrimental to the public
safety or welfare.”
○○ General exemptions:

1. “Records that are expressly made
confidential or nonpublic by statute”
should not be disclosed to the public.
2. “Records the disclosure of which would
. . . be detrimental to the best interests
of the public”8 are mandatorily exempt
from disclosure.
○○ Many other mandatory and discretionary

exemptions exist through specific statutes
and common law but are typically narrowly
construed so as to favor disclosure.
▶▶ Statutory

exemptions for certain
professions or industries may be found

Code.9
▶▶ Further rules regarding judicial records

may be found in the Alabama Code for
Criminal Procedure and the Alabama
Code for Civil Procedure.

○○ Segregable portions of documents may

be provided after material exempt from
disclosure has been redacted.

• Electronic Records:
○○ The definition of “public writings” has
been interpreted to encompass electronic
records.
▶▶ E-mail may be treated as any other form

of public record if releasing the content
would not create “unreasonable and
undue interference” with the agency’s
public duties.10

▶▶ Software,

if proprietary and of a
nonpublic source, is not subject to the
Public Records Law.

○○ The attorney general stated that the

public should have reasonable access in a
reasonable form, though public agencies
are not required to compile information or
tailor a dataset for the public.

▶▶ One

trial court opinion, however,
quoted an Ohio Supreme Court decision
in favor of providing information in a
format that would not require private
individuals to spend extensive amounts
of time compiling the data.11

○○ The law does not dictate a schedule of fees

for electronic records, and charges for access
to public records through online sites or in
other electronic formats vary.

• Money-Making:
○○ Alabama Code § 41-9-644 (2000) caps fees
for information from the Alabama Criminal
Justice Information Center (ACJIC) at
$25. Resulting revenues enter the State’s
General Fund. No other provisions relate to
generating revenues from sales of electronic
records.
○○ The Public Records Law does not regulate

the private use of public records. As
previously noted, records may be obtained
for commercial purposes, and individuals
or corporations may create value-added
services with public information for profit.

Alaska
Public Records Act
Codes: Alaska Stats. 40.25.100-220; 2 AAC 96.100 2 AAC 96.900
Relevant Court Cases: City of Kenai v. Kenai
Peninsula Newspapers, 642 P.2d 1316, 1323 (Alaska
1982); Doe v. Superior Court, 721 P.2d 617 (Alaska
1986); Capital Information Group v. Office of the
Governor, 923 P.2d 29 (Alaska 1996); Gwich’in
Steering Committee v. Office of the Governor, 10 P.3d
572 (Alaska 2000); Fuller v. City of Homer, 75 P.3d
1059 (Alaska 2003)
Though the act has been revised, re-codified, and
renumbered several times, statutory freedom of
information dates back to 1900 in Alaska. Alaska’s
Public Records Act, found in Title 40 of Alaska
Statues, states, “public access to government
information is a fundamental right that operates
to check and balance the actions of elected and
appointed officials and to maintain citizen control
of government.” Title 2, Chapter 96 of the Alaska
Administrative Code further establishes procedures
for providing access to public information. As
courts apply this act to various circumstances, the
balancing test used is predisposed to favor disclosure.
• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ The Public Records Act makes little
distinction among requesters of information
or the purpose for which the records are
sought.
▶▶ The only exception occurs when a

litigant requests records. Court rules
regarding discovery procedures would
then apply.

○○ The subsequent use of public records

remains unrestricted by the Public Records
Act.

• Whose and which records are covered under
the act:
○○ The executive branch is covered under
the language of the law that encompasses
“every public officer.”12

12

AS 40.25.110.

▶▶ Certain functions of the executive,

however, are exempt. Courts have recognized a deliberative process privilege
that protects materials relating to the
decision-making process when the government interest in confidentiality outweighs the public interest in disclosure.

○○ The Public Records Act explicitly covers

subordinate legislative entities, while state
legislative rules and statutes pertain to the
records made and kept by the Alaska state
legislature.13

○○ Administrative Rule 37.5 from the Alaska

Rules of Court enables access to documents
within the judicial branch.

○○ The

act expressly states that public
contractors are subject to the law. Records
relating to its public business must therefore
be disclosed to the public.
▶▶ However, the act may not necessarily

cover all nongovernmental bodies that
receive public funds or benefits.

○○ The term “public agency” has been defined

and applied broadly by courts to include
many boards and commissions, as well.

○○ The records subject to the act are defined

in terms equally as broad as the definition
of the entities to which they belong. Any
record a public agency or private contractor
for a public agency receives or develops is
covered, regardless of its physical format.

○○ Any record open to inspection may be

copied.

• Fees and costs:
○○ Requesters may be required to pay a fee prior
to receiving copies of public records. These
fees may not exceed the cost of duplication.
○○ Personnel fees may be added to duplication

costs if the time used to search for
documents exceeds five hours in one
month. The time spent determining if

available to veterans free of charge.

• Enforcement and sanctions:
○○ Individuals may seek help of the state
ombudsman if denied access to records but
generally rely on their own resources.14
○○ The law stipulates no role for the Depart-

ment of Law or any other state agency or
commission.

○○ Plaintiffs may recover costs of attorney fees

if successful in the suit to obtain public
records.

○○ Agencies may be found in contempt of a

court order if injunctive relief is granted
to the petitioner and the custodian fails to
produce the requested record.

• Exemptions:
○○ Various mandatory and discretionary
specific exemptions exist, while one general
exemption serves to seal “records required
to be kept confidential by federal law or
regulation or by state law.”15
○○ Specific

exemptions under the Public
Records Act include records regarding
adoption, juveniles, college tuition savings
program, electronic signatures, and
certain accidents; medical records; records
made confidential by law; records for law
enforcement purposes; and records related
to security, the disclosure of which may
detriment the public.

▶▶ E-mail is not mentioned in the law.
▶▶ Propriety software, however, is expressly

exempt from disclosure.17

○○ Individuals may request records in certain

formats, though agencies are not required
to provide data in a format in which it does
not currently exist.

○○ The

act distinguishes between public
records, which may exist in electronic
format, and electronic products or services.
Fees for reproduction of public records may
not exceed the cost of producing these
records. Agencies may charge an additional
fee for providing services which may tailor
records to fit requests.18
▶▶ Fees for electronic services may be

waived or reduced under the same circumstances regarding other fees previously mentioned.

• Money-Making:
○○ Public agencies may not charge more than
is reasonable to cover costs of providing
public records.
○○ Private individuals are permitted to use

public records for profit, as the law does not
address the use of public records. Businesses
often utilize publicly accessible records and
generate some value-added component to
the data to earn profits.

○○ As mentioned, common law exemptions

protect the deliberative process. Once

Dep’t, 193 Ariz. 35, 39, 969 P.2d 200, 204 (Ct. App.
1998)
Open records laws took root in Arizona in 1901.
The Arizona Supreme Court has since noted that
“this state has always favored open government and
an informed citizenry.”19 Arizona’s Public Records
Law, ranging from Sections 39-121 to 39-125 of
the Arizona Revised Statutes, inherently favors
disclosure and lacks specific statutory exemptions.
The courts were therefore left to establish common
law exemptions in response to challenges to denied
requests.
• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ Any person may request records for any
purpose, including commercial purposes.20
A requester must state the intended use of
the records, however.
▶▶ If

an individual misrepresents the
purpose of the request and fails to state
the commercial purpose, the requester
will be liable for damages and attorneys’
fees incurred by the public agency.21

○○ If the custodian of records believes the

proposed purpose represents a misuse of
records, the custodian may request the
governor issue an executive order to prevent
disclosure. If the governor does not respond
within 30 days, the custodian must issue
copies of the requested records.22

○○ The subsequent use of any records received

• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:
○○ The terms “officer” and “public body” have
been defined broadly to subject appointed
and elected officials within public agencies
to the law.
○○ No public entity is exempt in its entirety by

statute or common law.

○○ Records generated or used by public officials

in performing their duties are public records.
This does not necessarily include all records
in possession of a public official.23

○○ Entities receiving or expending public

funding are also subject to the act.24

○○ The phrase “[p]ublic records and other

matters” has been interpreted to include
videotapes, documents, maps, books,
photographs, films, audio materials, and
e-mails among materials available to the
public.25 The physical form of the record is
irrelevant.

○○ The law makes no distinction between

records available for inspection and those
available for copying but does dictate that
copies must be made under the supervision
of the custodian.

• Fees and costs:
○○ Though the law does not establish a
schedule of fees, it does stipulate that
fees may be levied depending on the
intended use of the information. The law
distinguishes between records requested
for non-commercial purposes and those
requested for commercial purposes:
▶▶ Custodians may charge a reasonable fee

for duplication of documents requested
for non-commercial purposes.

▶▶ If

the purpose of the records is
commercial use, the requester must pay a
fee comprised of three components:
1. A portion of the cost for obtaining
the documents;
2. A reasonable amount for the cost of
materials, equipment, and personnel
in providing reproductions; and
3. The value of the reproduction in the
commercial market.26

▶▶ The

newsgathering activities of
journalists are not considered as having
a commercial purpose.

○○ Documents

related to claims to be
presented to a U.S. bureau for benefits, such
as pensions or insurance, must be provided
free of charge.27

• Enforcement and sanctions:
○○ The law specifies sanctions against those
who misrepresent their intended use of
public records. If the requester obtains
the information for commercial purposes
without disclosing those purposes, he/she
may be liable for:
○○ Three times the amount of fees that would

have been paid in addition to attorneys’ fees

○○ Or three times the damages incurred if

the records would not have been provided
had the intended use been accurately
represented.28

○○ Citizens denied access to public records

may complain to the Office of the
Ombudsman-Citizens Aide, which has
investigative powers and the ability to make
recommendations to agencies, excluding
certain entities, such as the governor,
attorney general, state treasurer and
secretary of state.

○○ If a superior court deems the denial

wrongful and finds that the custodian acted
arbitrarily or in bad faith, the petitioner
may recover legal costs and will have a
cause of action against the public officer or
agency.

• Exemptions:
○○ The Arizona Public Records Law does not
codify mandatory exemptions, though other
state statutes do provide mandatory and
discretionary exemptions for records related
to law enforcement, legal proceedings, and
health facilities.29
○○ The law does state that “[n]othing in this

chapter requires the disclosure of a risk
assessment that is performed by or on behalf
of a federal agency to evaluate critical
energy, water or telecommunications
infrastructure to determine its vulnerability
to sabotage or attack.” 30

○○ The Arizona Supreme Court has established

three categories of circumstances under
which disclosure may not be required:
▶▶ Confidentiality,
▶▶ Privacy, and
▶▶ Disclosure is against the state’s best

interest.

○○ Segregable portions of documents which

contain exempt information are available
to the public.

• Electronic Records:
○○ The format of a record does not affect its
status under the law. The Public Records
Law, however, does not specifically address
many issues regarding electronic data, nor
do many court cases provide common law
guidelines.
○○ The issues of whether a certain format

can be requested, whether or not software
is subject to disclosure, and how fees are
assessed remain unaddressed.

• Money-Making:
○○ Commercial use of public records is
permitted if the requester states the
intended use. Additional fees may be
applied.

No comprehensive piece of legislation articulated
the public’s right to access government records until
1967 when Governor Winthrop Rockefeller signed
into law a bill first drafted by the Little Rock chapter
of Sigma Delta Chi, the Society of Professional
Journalists. Originally modeled in part after other
states’ statutes, this law has been amended 16 times
to clarify its intent. Chapter 19 of Title 25 of the
Arkansas Code formally and explicitly provides
citizens the statutory right to inspect and copy
public records.
• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ The Arkansas Freedom of Information Act
states that all citizens of Arkansas may
request access to public records.
▶▶ The term “citizens” has been expanded

to include corporations and partnerships
and
unincorporated
associations
conducting business in the state.31

○○ The Freedom of Information Act does not

restrict the use of records once obtained.

• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:
○○ The act covers records which are
“maintained in public offices or by public
employees within the scope of their
employment.”33
○○ With regards to executive entities, this

includes state university board of trustees,
advisory councils, and licensing agencies, to
name a few.

○○ This term includes all legislative bodies,

as well, including the General Assembly,
legislators, legislative committees, city
councils, and others.

○○ The judicial branch, however, is not covered

by this law, as courts have decided that
it would violate the separation of powers
doctrine. The court has the authority to
seal its records under certain circumstances,
though there is a common law right to
access judicial records.34

○○ Non governmental agencies that receive

public funding to perform public functions
that otherwise could have been conducted
by the government are also subject to the
act.35

○○ The physical form or location of any public

act exempts convicted felons
from obtaining those related to the

○○ Unless otherwise dictated by statute,
agencies may not impose fees greater
than the actual cost of reproducing the
documents.
▶▶ Personnel costs are excluded and may

not be part of the charge.

○○ Custodians may require advance payment if

the fee will likely exceed $25.37

○○ A custodian may waive a fee if the intended

use of the records is noncommercial and a
waiver is in the public’s best interest.

• Enforcement and sanctions:
○○ The Attorney General’s role regarding the
Freedom of Information Act is relatively
more prevalent than in other states. While
opinions are not binding, they may be
influential to the courts’ interpretation of
the act and are often sought by requesters
and custodians.
○○ The Attorney General also has power to

enforce the act and may bring a civil suit as
if he/she was the original requester denied
access to public records.38

○○ If negligence in violation of the Freedom of

Information Act occurs, the offender will be
guilty of a Class C misdemeanor and liable
for a fine up to $100 and/or imprisonment
not exceeding 30 days.39

○○ In the case of a civil suit, prevailing

plaintiffs may recoup attorney’s fees.

attorneys’ fees if the requester brought the
lawsuit frivolously.40

in disclosure and the need for the records to

○○ A general catch-all exemption prevents

the disclosure of any record that is made
confidential by other statutes.

○○ Specific exemptions under the Freedom of

Information Act relate to state income tax
records; medical, adoption, and education
records; historical or archeological files;
grand jury minutes; judicial and quasijudicial drafts; law enforcement records;
records protected by court orders or rules;
trade secrets; certain personnel records
(including evaluation records and home

time exceeding two hours, along with the
cost of copying, may be recovered from the

minimal.

companies to generate revenues to fund
its operations.

records in the same manner as those for
any other medium. Fees may not exceed the

and need not be stated, with the exception

4th 805, 813, 26 Cal. Rptr. 3d 92 (2005)
California adopted a constitutional amendment to
ensure the public’s access to government records. This
elevation to a constitutional stature signifies that
all existing statutory exemptions will be narrowly
construed and that any new exemptions must
conform to the standards set forth in the Sunshine
Amendment, as it is called. The amendment does
not, however, supersede any constitutional right to
privacy. The California Public Records Act, modeled
after the federal Freedom of Information Act,
further promotes access through provisions designed
to allow agencies to exceed the minimum standards
in opening their records, including discretionary fee
waivers and discretionary exemptions.

○○ The subsequent use of obtained records is

unrestricted, with one exception. Those
requesting addresses of people arrested
for or victims of a crime may not use the
acquired information to earn revenues.50

• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:
○○ The California Public Records Act applies
to the executive branch, including all state
and local offices, boards, commissions,
departments, and other subdivisions.
○○ The legislative branch does not fall under

the California Public Records Act. It
is, however, covered by the Sunshine
Amendment and the Legislative Open
Records Act. The public therefore has a
constitutional right to access any records of
legislative bodies not otherwise statutorily
made confidential.

○○ The judicial branch is likewise excluded

from the Public Records Act but is covered
under the Sunshine Amendment, which
does not supersede any other pre-existing
exemptions found in other statutes or
judicial rules of procedure.

• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ “Every person” has the right to access public
records. This term includes corporations,
associations, partnerships, limited liability
companies, and other firms.47

○○ Any non-governmental body is subject to

the law if it is established by a legislative
body which delegates its authority to that
entity or if it receives funding from an
agency and a member of the legislative body
is appointed to the governing entity of the
private organization.

must show relevant findings that disclosure
is against the best interest of the public,
due to the Sunshine Amendment in
the California Constitution. The party
preventing disclosure bears the burden of
proving the need for confidentiality.

○○ All physical forms of records are covered.
○○ Any record that is available for inspection is

also available for copying unless the task of
copying is unreasonable, or too burdensome
and costly.52

○○ The general catch-all exemption allows

records to be withheld if “the public interest
served by not making the record public
clearly outweighs the public interest served
by disclosure of the record.”55

• Fees and costs:
○○ Fees are limited to the direct cost of
reproduction of the requested records.

○○ Unless the statutory exemptions demand

otherwise, they may be applied at the
discretion of the custodian, as the Public
Records Act grants agencies the authority
to provide a higher level of access than is
required by the minimum standards.

○○ Custodians

may not charge for the
time spent searching for documents
or determining the eligibility of those
documents for disclosure.

found in Section 6254 of the Public Records
Act. These are numerous, though narrowly
construed. Many relate to personnel files;
personal, financial, medical, and police
records; records relating to pending
investigations and litigation; and many
other categories.

○○ The act does not explicitly provide for fee

waivers but grants agencies discretionary
power to promote greater access to public
records.53 Under this authority, custodians
may reduce or waive fees.

• Enforcement and sanctions:
○○ Individuals may seek injunctive relief after
being denied access to public records.

○○ Sections 6276.02 through 6276.45 of the

Public Records Act list more than 600
statutory exemptions derived from other
sections of the California Code, ranging
from records relating to accident reports
to those pertaining to the youth service
bureau.

agency may extend the time limitation
to provide the records rather than
denying access altogether.

2. Records relating to the deliberative
process are exempt to protect the
decision-making process and prevent
the confusion that could arise upon
disclosing documents prematurely.58

○○ As with other physical forms of public

records, agencies may charge only the direct
cost of duplication (or transmission in the
case of e-mail) with two exceptions:

○○ Segregable portions of otherwise exempt

material should be available.59 Agencies
must bear either the costs of separating the
exempt material from public information or
the burden of proving that the task is too
onerous.60

1. If an agency provides information
outside the regularly scheduled interval
in which it normally produces the
records, it may charge the cost of
constructing the record.

• Electronic Records:
○○ The openness of a record is not hindered by
its existence in an electronic format.

2. If the request requires the agency to
compile, extract, or program software to
produce a record, the requester may bear
those additional costs.

▶▶ E-mail is considered public.61
▶▶ Software, however, is excluded from

disclosure requirements.62

○○ If a public entity maintains a public

record in an electronic format, it must be
made available in an electronic format.
Providing only a written paper copy to the
public does not suffice. If an agency keeps
records in more than one electronic format,
individuals may request whichever format
they prefer.

• Money-Making:
○○ The California Public Records Act allows
public agencies to sell, lease, or license
the computer software they develop for
noncommercial or commercial use.
○○ Three specific provisions prohibit private

individuals’ commercial use of certain
public records:

▶▶ As mentioned, addresses of arrested

individuals may not be obtained for
commercial purposes.

▶▶ There is no requirement, however, for

an agency to comply with a request to
tailor information to a specific format
in which the records are not already
maintained.

▶▶ Home addresses or telephone numbers

of appointed or elected officials may not
be sold or solicited with the intent to
cause danger or harm.64

▶▶ No agency may deny access to public

records on the grounds that providing
the information would require the agency
to “compile data, write programming
language or a computer program, or to

Wick Communications v. Montrose County Board of
County Commissioners, 81 P.3d 360 (Colo. 2003)
Article 72 of Title 24 of the Colorado Revised
Statutes contains the Colorado Public Records Act.
Enacted in 1969, it was originally patterned after the
federal Freedom of Information Act. Subsequent
amendments, however, produced distinctions
between the two. In 1977, the legislature adopted
the Criminal Justice Records Act as an amendment
to the article (Colo. Rev. Stat. § 24-72-301, et seq.).
These provisions offer criminal justice agencies a bit
of latitude in determining which records are subject
to disclosure, though records of official action
remain open to the public.
• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ Under the statute, “any person” may
obtain access to public records that are
not copyright protected. The term person
includes
corporations,
partnerships,
limited liability companies, firms and other
associations.66
▶▶ The person who is the subject of the

record may have greater access to that
record than others.67

○○ The purpose of the request is immaterial

and the subsequent use of public records
unrestricted with the exception of those
related to criminal justice. A requester must
indicate that the intended use of criminal

justice records is not for commercial
purposes.
• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:
○○ The act makes public records “made,
maintained, or kept by the state or any
agency, institution, a nonprofit corporation
incorporated pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat.
§ 23-5-121(2), or political subdivision of
the state, or that are described in Colo.
Rev. Stat. § 29-1-902, and held by any local
government-financed entity.”68
○○ This applies to executive and legislative

offices and entities at all state and local
levels.

○○ This act does not cover all courts and

all actions of the courts, however. The
Colorado Public Records Act does include
the court registry of actions, all judgment
records, and the records of official actions
regarding criminal cases.
▶▶ The Criminal Justice Records Act

determines the openness of criminal
case files.

▶▶ Otherwise,

other information is
disclosed or kept confidential at the
discretion of the custodian.

○○ The term “political subdivision” has been

extended by the courts to include private
entities. The courts analyze several factors
in determining whether a corporation is
subject to the Colorado Public Records
Act, including whether it receives public
funding, performs public duties, uses public
property, and is controlled by a public
entity.69

○○ The definition of public records includes

those made “for use in the exercise of
functions required or authorized by law

materials requested.

○○ Agencies may charge a “nominal” fee for

attorneys’ fees.

○○ Nothing that is confidential by state or

federal statutes or court orders may be
disclosed.

○○ Though all records available for inspection

are also available for copying, the originals
must remain under the supervision of
a custodian. If the agency in which the
requested documents are located does not
have copying facilities, the requester will
incur the costs of providing facilities.

○○ Certain

specific exemptions in the
Colorado Public Records Act relate to
medical, sociological, or scholastic-related
achievement data; personnel files; trade
secrets; records regarding users of public
libraries, facilities, utilities, or other services;
and records regarding sexual harassment
claims and investigations.

• Enforcement and sanctions:
○○ The Colorado Public Records Act offers
little direction for individuals seeking
remedy for wrongfully denied requests:

○○ Agencies have discretionary authority to

prohibit access to examination materials, real
estate appraisals for state purposes, market
analysis performed by the Department of
Transportation, and photographs from the
Department of Revenue.

▶▶ No ombudsman or agency is charged

with the task of enforcing this law.

• Electronic Records:
○○ Electronic records are subject to the
Colorado Public Records Act.
▶▶ E-mail is public, and public agencies

must have a written policy regarding
monitoring electronic communications
and informing employees of its subject
to disclosure.78

▶▶ Custodians may request a district court

10001 et seq.;
Administrative Procedures Act: 29 Del. C. § 10101 et
seq.

Billingsley, 1980 WL 3043 (Del. Ch. Nov. 20, 1980);
Lee v. Minner, 369 F. Supp. 2d 527 (D. Del. 2005);

v. News-Journal Co., 480 A.2d 628 (Del. 1984); News
Journal Co. v. McLaughlin, 377 A.2d 358 (Del. Ch.
1977);
Though it bears the same name, the Delaware
Freedom of Information Act, adopted in 1977, is
not modeled after its federal counterpart. Many
exemptions found in the state act are, however,
nearly identical to the wording found in the federal
statute. These exemptions are narrowly construed
by the courts. The Administrative Procedures
Act further enumerates documents that are to be
either disclosed or withheld, but the Freedom of
Information Act is much broader in its reach.

• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:
○○ The Delaware Freedom of Information
Act encompasses all public bodies that
are not otherwise expressly exempt. A “[p]
ublic body” is defined as “any regulatory,
administrative,
advisory,
executive,
appointive or legislative body of the State,
or of any political subdivision of the
State, including, but not limited to, any
board, bureau, commission, department,
agency, committee, … association, group,
panel, council or any other entity or
body established by an act of the General
Assembly of the State…”83
○○ The act therefore covers the executive

branch and its members.

○○ The General Assembly is subject to the act,

though committees, subcommittees, and
caucuses are not.

○○ As public entities established by the

General Assembly are subject to the act,
those courts that the legislature created,
such as the Family Court, the Justice of the
Peace Court, and the Administrative Office
of the Courts, are covered.

• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ Though the Delaware Freedom of
Information Act allows only Delaware state
citizens to access public records, case law
has extended this right to citizens of other
states, as well. Corporate citizens also enjoy
this same right.

▶▶ Those established by the Delaware

Constitution are subject to the provisions
of the constitution, rather than the
Delaware Freedom of Information
Act. Common law has provided access
to court records, as the Delaware
Constitution states “[a]ll Courts shall be
open.”84

▶▶ Agencies are only legally obligated to

make records public after receiving a
request under the act. The custodian of
the records is charged with allowing or
denying access and bears the burden of
proof to justify nondisclosure.82

○○ Private

bodies,
including
agencies,
commissions, or multi-regional entities, are
subject to the act if they meet any one of
three criteria found in Section 10002(c):

○○ The purpose of a request does not affect

a person’s right to obtain access to public
records.

1. The entity is supported at least partially
by public funds;

○○ The use of public records, even commercial

use, is not restricted by law.

2. The entity expends or disburses public
funds through grants, gifts or other
methods; or
3. The entity is implicitly or explicitly
charged by a public body to advise or
conduct investigations.
▶▶ Having a public official serve as a

member of a private organization does
not bring that organization under the
act.

○○ “Public record” is broadly defined as

“information of any kind, owned, made,
used, retained, received, produced,
composed, drafted or otherwise compiled
or collected, by any public body, relating in
any way to public business, or in any way of
public interest…”85

○○ The physical format of the record is

inconsequential.

○○ All those available for inspection are also

available for copying.

• Fees and costs:
○○ Agencies are left to establish “reasonable”
fees for providing copies of public records
and may charge for the time spent searching
for requested records.
○○ Once set, however, agencies may not deviate

from their fee policy without presenting
adequate notice.86

○○ Agencies do have authority to waive fees,

should it serve the public interest.

▶▶ Conversely, agencies may not raise fees

in efforts to construct an obstacle to
prevent access to public records.

• Enforcement and sanctions:
○○ Citizens denied access to public records may
bring suit against the public agency within
60 days of the denial of the request.
○○ The

requester may also petition the
Attorney General to determine if a
violation has taken place or may be about
to occur. If the Attorney General decides
the public agency should have produced the
records, the citizen may either file suit or

85
86

29 Del. C. § 10002(g).
29 Del. C. § 10003.

request that the Attorney General do so on
his/her behalf.
▶▶ The Attorney General is not obligated

to file suit upon request.

▶▶ The public agency, which receives a

notification from the Attorney General
of the citizen’s petition and the resulting
opinion, may choose to grant access to
the records at that point.

○○ If successful in court, a plaintiff may

be awarded injunctive relief as well as
attorneys’ fees and costs.
▶▶ If the action was frivolous or brought

only to harass the defendant, costs and
attorneys’ fees may be awarded to the
agency.

• Exemptions:
○○ Delaware lacks a general exemption
that would grant agencies substantial
latitude in prohibiting access to records.
Exemptions must be specifically mandated
by statute within the Delaware Freedom
of Information Act or elsewhere in the
Delaware Code or derived from common
law.
○○ The caucuses of the General Assembly,

along with the University of Delaware and
Delaware State University, excluding their
respective Boards of Trustees, are exempt
from this act.

○○ Seventeen

other statutory exemptions
discuss medical and investigatory files, trade
secrets, collective bargaining and pending
litigation records, and other records
that could jeopardize security or violate
personal privacy if disclosed. Further details
regarding each exemption may be found in
section 10002(g).
▶▶ Each of these exemptions is to be

narrowly construed.87

○○ Many

other
statutory
exemptions
exist outside the Delaware Freedom of
Information Act which does not supersede

A.2d 628 (Del. 1984); News Journal Co. v. McLaughlin,

other confidentiality requirements set forth
in other sections of the Delaware Code.88

○○ The format in which agencies provide

electronic information may be determined
by each agency. The act does not mandate
custodians tailor the format or content of
public electronic records upon request.

○○ Court-derived exemptions fall under three

general categories:

1. Executive privilege: Records may be
exempt if they are deemed privileged.89

▶▶ The task of redacting exempt material

from databases that contain information
that would otherwise be made public,
however, may prove to be a burden that
prevents disclosure of those databases.

2. Social Security numbers: Though
contained in payroll documentation,
social security numbers are not subject
to disclosure.90
3. Administrative burden: Courts may
deny access to public records if the cost
of procuring them constitutes an undue
burden on the agency.91
○○ Citizens may obtain versions of redacted

materials from certain agencies upon
bearing the cost of those services.

• Electronic Records:
○○ As the Delaware Freedom of Information
Act applies to all public records regardless
of physical characteristics, electronic
records are covered.

○○ Agencies may charge a reasonable expense,

as with other forms of records.

• Money-Making:
○○ The Secretary of State, whose schedule of
fees is not subject to the Delaware Freedom
of Information Act, may earn revenues in
excess of its costs, as it is permitted to charge
up to $500 for expediting the reproduction
of electronic records.92
▶▶ Other public agencies governed by the

Delaware Freedom of Information Act
may charge only reasonable fees.

○○ Citizens are not prohibited from using

limitations of commercial use exist and will
be discussed further.
• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:
○○ The Florida Public Records Law covers
records “made or received pursuant to
law or ordinance or in connection with
the transaction of official business by any
agency.”94
▶▶ The definition of “agency” includes

“any state, county district, authority, or
municipal officer, department division,
board, bureau, commission, or other
separate unit of government created or
established by law . . . and any other
public or private agency, partnership,
corporation, or business entity acting on
behalf of any public agency.”95

Florida has several statutory provisions which grant
the public a high degree of access to government
records. The Public Records Law from Chapter 119
of Title X allows no general, catch-all exemption
found in many other similar public records statutes.
The act does not, however, supersede other statutes
mandating confidentiality and enumerates many
specific exemptions. Each exemption, however, is
subject to the Open Government Sunset Review
Act. Passed in 1995, this statute compels the state
legislature to review each exemption five years after
its passage and justify the necessity of maintaining
confidentiality. The Constitution of Florida
explicitly states that individuals’ right to privacy
does not limit the public’s right to access public
records, and the courts have no authority to create
common law exemptions.

○○ The executive and legislative branches at

all levels of government are subject to the
act. Unless statutory exemptions mandate
otherwise, records of these offices are open
to the public.

○○ The judicial branch is not covered by

the Public Records Law, but rather the
Florida Constitution that ensures open
proceedings. The judicial branch operates
under a strong presumption of disclosure.
The Supreme Court has found that court
records may be sealed if the circumstances
meet a three part test96:
1. Closure is required to prevent a serious
threat to the administration of justice;

• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ Any person may request access to records.
This
includes
corporations,
firms,
estates, trusts, associations, syndicates,
partnerships, joint ventures, and “all other
groups or combinations.”93

2. Protecting the defendant’s right to
an impartial trial necessitates nondisclosure, and no alternative means
exist; and
3. The court can capably invoke closure to
protect the rights of the accused without
being any broader than is necessary.

○○ The purpose for obtaining public records

and their subsequent use is immaterial.
Anyone may request records for any
purpose, including commercial purposes or
mere curiosity. A few narrow and specific

▶▶ Grand jury proceedings are kept strictly

confidential, though the name of the
foreman may be released.

○○ Non-governmental agencies may be subject

to the Florida Public Records Law, but an
agency merely receiving public funding may
not fall under the act. The courts consider
six factors when applying the law to nongovernmental entities:
▶▶ Whether a public agency created the

private organization;

▶▶ Whether the private entity receives

substantial funding from the public;

▶▶ Whether the public agency retains

regulatory control;

▶▶ Whether the agencies’ decision-making

process involves one another;

▶▶ Whether the private body performs a

government function; and

▶▶ Whether the goal of the private entity is

to assist the public.

○○ An agency is also subject to the act if it

spends public funds to pay membership dues
or if a public official’s membership in the
group is “in connection with the transaction
of official business by an agency.”97

○○ The term “public records” is defined as “all

documents, papers, letters, maps, books,
tapes, photographs, films, sound recordings,
data processing software, or other material,
regardless of physical form or characteristics,
or means of transmission, made or received
pursuant to law or ordinance or in
connection with the transaction of official
business by any agency.”98
▶▶ In absence of a specific statutory

exemption, records, regardless of type,
are subject to public inspection under
the Florida Public Records Law.

○○ Unless copyrighted by the public agency,

all that is available for inspection is also
available for copying.

• Fees and costs:
○○ Fees are limited to the actual costs of
duplication, which should not include any
labor costs associated with searching or
producing documents.99
▶▶ If extensive assistance from personnel

is required, the agency may charge a
special service fee derived from the cost
to the agency.

▶▶ Many statutory laws or department

policies regulate the fees charged for the
reproduction of specific records.

○○ Provisions for fee waivers are not addressed

in the act.

• Enforcement and sanctions:
○○ Though the courts have not yet addressed
who exactly has the right to sue, the Florida
Public Records Law states that any action
brought under the provisions it sets forth
will receive priority over pending cases.100
○○ If the court orders disclosure, the agency

has 48 hours to grant access to the records
in question. The court may grant a stay if it
believes substantial damage may be caused
by the disclosure of the information.

○○ If an agency is found to have wrongfully

denied access to public records, it is liable
for attorneys’ fees and costs.101

• Exemptions:
○○ This statute lacks a general, catch-all
exemption common to many states’ public
records laws. Any record not expressly
exempt is subject to disclosure. Moreover,
the Florida Constitution provides no
individual right to privacy with regards to
public record.102
○○ Specific

exemptions,
however,
are
numerous, exceeding two hundred. Each
expires after five years of enactment if not
re-enacted by the legislature under the
Open Government Sunset Review Act of
1995. In creating or re-enacting exemptions,

See Article I, Section 23 of the Florida
Constitution. The issue of a federal constitutional right to
privacy remains ambiguous in disjoint court rulings.

the legislature must demonstrate the public
necessity for nondisclosure and construct
the exemption as narrowly as possible.
▶▶ Though the act is unclear regarding

whether certain exemptions are
discretionary, when the language is such
that it is clearly not mandatory, the
presumption of openness would likely
allow discretion.

• Money-Making:
○○ Public agencies may sell software for which
it holds a copyright based on market
considerations and use the proceeds for
authorized purposes.105
○○ Private use of public records for commercial

purposes is largely unrestricted with few
exceptions:
▶▶ Information from motor vehicle records

▶▶ If someone requests a record that

received pursuant to the Florida Public
Records Law may not be used for “mass
commercial solicitation of clients
for litigation against motor vehicle
dealers.”106

exemptions; therefore, no case law
exemptions exist. The court may, however,
determine the constitutionality of applying
specific provisions of the act to certain
records.

• Electronic Records:
○○ Electronic records, including e-mail and
software, are covered under the Florida
Public Records Law.
▶▶ Software may be exempt if it is

copyrighted or constitutes a trade secret.

○○ An agency must provide records in the

format requested if it keeps records in that
format.

○○ If the requester prefers a format other than

one the agency routinely uses, the agency
may provide the material in the requested
format at its discretion and charge the
requester for any substantial use of the
agency’s information technology resources.

Article 4, Chapter 18, Title 50 of the Official
Code of Georgia Annotated contains the Georgia
Open Records Act. Agencies must operate under
the presumption of openness, and exemptions are
specific and narrowly construed. Personal privacy
and public safety are protected, however. Though
the act does not cover the General Assembly or the
courts of the state, each has adopted its own rules of
procedure that favor disclosure unless there exists a
clear reason for confidentiality.
• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ Though the Georgia Open Records Act
states that citizens of Georgia may access
public records, case law and opinions from
the Attorney General have extended this
right to nonresidents as well.108

2. Any party to a proceeding governed by
the Georgia Administrative Procedure
Act may not use the Open Records
Act to obtain records related to the
proceeding without prior approval from
the presiding judge.110
○○ Once lawfully attained under the act, the

use of public records is unrestricted.

• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:
○○ Records “prepared and maintained or
received in the course of the operation of
a public office or agency” are subject to the
Georgia Open Records Act.111
○○ The term “public office or agency” has been

interpreted broadly so as to favor disclosure.
This includes executive offices at the state
and local levels. These agencies may not
adopt administrative rules or agreements to
limit the applicability of the act.

○○ Legislative bodies fall under the act because

they perform public functions. The General
Assembly itself is exempt from the act. It
may employ its own procedural rules.112

○○ Judicial records are likewise not subject to

the act but are generally made available to
the public through the internal procedures
adopted by the courts.
▶▶ Records

relating
to
settlement
agreements which involve government
entities, however, are subject to the act.

○○ The purpose of requesting records is

normally irrelevant with two exceptions:

1. Commercial solicitation is limited in
that selling records to unauthorized
users is a misdemeanor. Generally if a
record is available to one citizen, it will
be equally accessible to all. However, in
1999 the General Assembly restricted
access to Uniform Motor Vehicle
Accident reports to only those parties
specifically named in the report or

public functions or receive more than onethird of their funds from a public source are
subject to the act, as well.

characteristics or location, are subject to
inspection and copying under the act.

• Fees and costs:
○○ Agencies may charge reasonable costs,
not to exceed 25 cents per page, unless
otherwise statutorily authorized.113
○○ Agencies may also levy fees for excessive

administrative costs, excluding legal
fees for determining the openness of the
documents, incurred while searching or
retrieving records.
▶▶ Custodians must provide an estimate for

the costs and bear the burden of proving
the necessity of the fees if a dispute
arises.

▶▶ Attorneys’ fees may also be rewarded if

either party lacked sufficient justification
for either denying access to records or in
bringing the suit.

• Exemptions:
○○ Exemptions are to be narrowly construed,
and the custodian bears the burden of
proving the necessity of nondisclosure.
Moreover, the custodian must specifically
cite the legal authority under which the
documents are exempt within three days of
denying access.116
○○ Exemptions are specific in nature. Many are

discretionary, though records that are made
confidential by federal law or the disclosure
of which would cause an undue invasion of
privacy are mandatorily exempt.

▶▶ Agencies must provide the copies in the

most economical manner available.

○○ The law does not explicitly prohibit or

required to be kept confidential under
federal law, privileged communications
with the Office of Legislative Counsel,
certain records relating to law enforcement,
accident reports, medical files, evaluations
of public employees, and records which
would create an invasion of personal privacy
or compromise public safety if disclosed,
among others.

• Enforcement and sanctions:
○○ Any person or entity, including the
Attorney General at his/her discretion,
may bring an action against those denying
access to records.
▶▶ There is no commission or agency or

ombudsman charged with enforcement.
However, the Office of the Attorney
General has created an informal
mediation program through which
citizens may submit complaints.

▶▶ Other specific exemptions under the

Georgia Open Records Act and other
statutes can be found through the state
legislature’s website.117

test on a case-by-case basis to determine
if disclosure would constitute an extreme
invasion of privacy.

○○ The act states that “[a]ny person knowingly

and willfully violating the provisions of
this article by failing or refusing to provide
access to records not subject to exemption
from this article or by failing or refusing
to provide access to such records within

▶▶ If segregation is not possible, the

custodian is required to disclose the
entire record.118

• Electronic Records:
○○ Electronic records are subject to the same
guidelines as other types of records under
the act.

• Money-Making:
○○ Clerks of the state’s superior courts are
permitted to enter into contracts to
“distribute, sell, or otherwise market records
or computer generated data of the office of
the clerk” to generate a profit.121
▶▶ This

allows clerks to receive
compensation for providing information
in accessible formats to private entities
who earn profits reselling the data.

▶▶ E-mails are treated as other forms of

records.

▶▶ Software

and computer programs,
however, are exempt from disclosure. 119

○○ Private commercial purposes are permitted

except when firms or individuals sell
public records to those unauthorized to
receive them, as some specific exemptions
allow access to certain individuals while
restricting others.

○○ When feasible, agencies must make records

that are kept electronically available in
electronic format. Custodians are not
required to compile separate data sets or
create new software to comply with citizens’
requests.

○○ Agencies may charge for the actual cost

of providing records in electronic format,
along with administrative fees in the same
manner as they may for other types of
records. The act explicitly states that new
fees not directly related to providing access
to records may not be levied simply because
the records are available in electronic
format.120

Hawaii
Uniform Information Practices Act

▶▶ The purpose of a governmental agency’s

request, however, may be grounds for
denying access.

Codes: Haw. Rev. Stat. § 92F, et seq.
Hawaii’s original Sunshine Law, which encompassed
both public records and meetings, was enacted in
1975, prior to the constitutional amendment that
established a right to privacy. In response to the
amendment and in efforts to correct ambiguities,
Hawaii passed the Uniform Information Practices
Act in 1988. While it recognizes privacy rights,
the statute also demands disclosure under many
circumstances and allows discretion on the part
of custodians to increase openness. The act also
established the Office of Information Practices to
issue opinions clarifying the law’s intent, oversee
appeals, and issue reports regarding open records. Of
particular note, the Uniform Information Practices
Act not only addresses private bodies’ right to access
records, but also other governmental agencies’
right to access records. To maintain individuals’
privacy rights, governmental agencies are somewhat
restricted in their information sharing practices.

○○

▶▶ Governmental use is restricted. Of

particular note, any agency which
receives records from another agency is
subject to the same rules of disclosure as
the agency which provided the records.

• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:
○○ The definition of “agency” within the
Uniform Information Practices Act
encompasses “any unit of government in
this State,” which includes more than 6,800
entities.
○○ The act does not explicitly state whether

• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ Any
person, including individuals,
corporations, governmental entities, trusts,
partnerships, associations, and all other
legal entities may request access to public
records.

executive offices or officials are subject to
the rules of disclosure, though the broad
definition likely covers at least the offices.

○○ The legislative branch is subject to the law,

and its committee reports are made public
through internal procedures of the state
legislature.

▶▶ In many cases, individuals may request

records anonymously and may refuse to
give an agency their names.

○○ The act exempts the “non-administrative

functions of the courts,” to protect the
disclosure of courts’ deliberative processes.
Final opinions and court orders are public
records, however.124

▶▶ Foreign governments engaged in legally

authorized law enforcement activities
may access public records.122

▶▶ Governmental

agencies may not,
however, share records except under ten
distinct circumstances enumerated in
Section 92F-19.

▶▶ Other statutes, internal rules of procedure,

and established practices will also dictate
the disclosure of judicial records.

○○ Nongovernmental

bodies which are
managed, owned, or operated by or the
behalf of public entities may be subject
to the law. Whether an organization does
indeed perform a public function is decided
on a case-by-case basis.

○○ The purpose of a request made by a

private individual or business is generally
immaterial, and the party denying access to
records bears the burden of proving that the
purpose falls under an exception provided
by law.

122

Haw. Rev. Stat. § 92F-19(a)(3).

The act does not restrict individuals’
subsequent use of public records and
absolves them from any liability if they
acted in good faith in disclosing or not
disclosing government records.123

Haw. Rev. Stat. § 92F-16
Haw. Rev. Stat. § 92F-12(a)(2).

Open Records Laws: A State by State Report •December 2010 • 37

○○ All existing government records, unless

statutorily mandated otherwise, are subject
to the act, regardless of physical form.
Agencies are not required to generate new
records upon request, though they must
provide records in the requested format if
the records already exist in that format.

• Enforcement and sanctions:
○○ The act requires agencies to adopt and
disseminate rules and regulations in
accordance with the law.
○○ The Uniform Information Practices Act

also established and funds the Office of
Information Practice, a division of the
Lieutenant Governor’s Office.126

▶▶ Section 92F-12(a)(1)-(16) outlines sixteen

categories of records which agencies
must disclose. With the exception of
any record subject to other laws that
mandate confidentiality, these will be
disclosed regardless of whether they
contain personal information. These
categories include rules of procedure and
court orders, pardons, environmental
tests, minutes of public meetings, public
personnel information, information
regarding loans from the state, and
several others.

▶▶ The legislature appoints an ombudsman,

who has jurisdiction to investigate into
agencies’ actions. The OIP facilitates
between requesters and public officials
through an appeals process. The office
also issues formal and informal opinions
interpreting the law and provides
information and statistics regarding
public records and agencies in Hawaii.

○○ Individuals also retain a right to pursue

action in court. Prevailing plaintiffs may
recover attorneys’ fees and costs.

○○ Any record open for inspection is also

available for copying.

• Fees and costs:
○○ Unlike other open records laws, the
Uniform Information Practices Act imposes
a minimum fee of five cents per page.
Other costs may include personnel cost for
searching and reproducing, material and
certification costs, and other related costs.125
○○ The act also gives the Office of Information

Practices (OIP) the authority to adopt rules
related to fees and provisions for waivers to
establish uniformity among governmental
agencies.

○○ Criminal sanctions may be levied against

public officials who willfully and knowingly
grant public access to confidential records
or against individuals who willfully and
knowingly obtain access to confidential
records.

• Exemptions:
○○ Exemptions are narrowly construed. All but
two are specific, and many are discretionary
to allow more disclosure.
○○ Section 92F-13 lists five circumstances that

may bar disclosure:

1. “Government records which, if disclosed,
would constitute a clearly unwarranted
invasion of personal privacy;”127

○○ The first $30 of fees resulting from searching,

reviewing, and segregating documents must
be waived, according to the OIP. Further
fee waivers must be granted when they will
serve in the public’s best interest. The OIP
defines certain circumstances which may be
deemed as serving the public’s interest.

◈◈ Section

92F-14 provides several
examples of information which would
constitute an undue invasion of
privacy, including individuals’ social
security numbers, financial records,
and medical files.

○○ Agencies may require fees be paid in

advance, but they may not charge excessive
fees to obstruct access to records.

125

Haw. Rev. Stat. § 92-21 (Supp. 1999).

38 • National Association of Counties

2. “Government records pertaining to the
prosecution or defense of any judicial or
quasi-judicial action to which the State
or any county is or may be a party, to

the extent that such records would not
be discoverable;”128
3. “Government records that, by their
nature, must be confidential in order for
the government to avoid the frustration
of a legitimate government function;”129
4. “Government records which, pursuant
to state or federal law including an
order of any state or federal court, are
protected from disclosure;”130
5. “Inchoate and draft working papers of
legislative committees including budget
worksheets and unfiled committee
reports; work product; records or
transcripts of an investigating committee
of the legislature which are closed by
rules adopted pursuant to section 21-4
and the personal files of members of the
legislature.”131
○○ Other

statutory exemptions may be
found throughout the Revised Statutes as
they relate specifically to each agency or
licensing board.132

○○ Under the five categories listed above, courts

may order the disclosure or confidentiality
of certain records but typically construe
such exceptions narrowly.

○○ Segregable portions of documents that

contain otherwise confidential information
are to be made available to the public.

• Electronic Records:
○○ The Uniform Information Practices Act
explicitly covers electronic records. The
existence of any record in electronic format
cannot affect its openness.
▶▶ Software is not public.
▶▶ E-mails may be, depending on the

nature of their content.

○○ Requesters may not choose the format in

which records are provided, as the OIP
decides the proper format on a case-by-case
basis. The office may, however, provide a
customized search upon request.

○○ The statute only mentions geographic

information systems with regards to the
fees that may be charged for reproducing
these records. Charges may include direct
material and labor costs associated with
providing the records though practices may
vary from agency to agency.
▶▶ Other fees are likely assessed in a similar

fashion to fees for other types of public
records.

• Money-Making:
○○ The Uniform Information Practices Act
does not address money-making practices by
private or public entities. Commercial use
of public records is not explicitly prohibited,
though the use of certain records may be
dictated by other statutes.

school district, municipal corporation,
district, public health district, political
subdivision, or any agency thereof, or
any committee of a local agency, or any
combination thereof.”136

Chapter 3 of Title 9 of the Idaho Code contains the
Public Records Act. Enacted in 1990, this legislation
represents one of the most recently adopted acts
of its kind. The Supreme Court of Idaho has thus
had few opportunities to address its provisions. The
office of the Attorney General provides a manual to
inform the public about their right to access records
and their right to privacy.

○○ Courts have the authority to adopt rules to

govern the disclosure of records of judicial
proceedings.

○○ Agencies, on the other hand, do not have

this rule-making power and cannot limit
the openness of records without specific
statutory authority.

• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ Any person, including corporations,
partnerships, associations, government
bodies, or any other legal entity may request
access to public records. The act does not
distinguish between citizens of any other
state or country.133

○○ The courts have not yet addressed the

applicability of the Public Records Act to
non-public entities which receive public
funding or have members who are public
officials.

○○ The definition of records is as broad as the

definition of the public entities defined under
the act. The term “public records” includes
“any writing containing information
relating to the conduct or administration
of the public’s business prepared, owned,
used or retained by any state agency,
independent public body corporate and
politic or local agency regardless of physical
form or characteristics.”137

○○ Agencies may not inquire as to the purpose

of the request except to ensure that the
intended use of public records is not to
generate a telephone or mailing list, which
is prohibited in the Idaho Public Records
Act.134

○○ With the exception of selling mailing or

telephone lists, the subsequent use of public
records is largely unrestricted.

• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:
○○ The act encompasses both state and local
agencies within the executive, judicial, and
legislative branches of government.
▶▶ State agencies include “every state

officer, department, division, bureau,
commission and board or any committee
of a state agency including those in the

▶▶ The physical format of the material is

irrelevant, and any document available
for inspection are also open for
copying, either through handwriting,

• Fees and costs:
○○ Fees may include the actual cost of
reproducing the records.
○○ Fees may also include personnel costs under

three circumstances:

1. The request for paper records exceeds
100 pages;
2. The request requires the custodian to
segregate nonpublic information from
the public portion of the records;
3. The labor associated with searching
for and copying records exceeds two
hours.139
○○ Public agencies may not charge fees if the

individual requesting records is unable to
pay or if a collection of fees would harm the
public’s interest.140

○○ Unless otherwise prescribed by law, agencies

may not charge more than the direct costs
of reproducing the record or more than
the cost of selling the data in a publication
form.

• Enforcement and sanctions:
○○ The task of enforcement falls on the
private individuals who were denied access
to records. They may file an action in the
district court in which the records are
located.
○○ The Attorney General has only a limited

role relating to public information.

▶▶ The office of the Attorney General

publishes an “Idaho Public Records Law
Manual” to educate the public regarding
the act.141

▶▶ The

Attorney General encourages
compliance from agencies and officials
and offers training on the act for public
entities.

• Exemptions:
○○ Exemptions are specific and typically
mandatory. The exemptions that are
discretionary are often construed by public
agencies to favor nondisclosure for fear
of disclosing sensitive information. If a
custodian releases a record in good faith,
however, he/she is immune from liability.
○○ More than 75 exemptions exist within the

Public Records Act. Many of these relate
to law enforcement, investigatory, and
juvenile records; personnel and employment
files; financial, medical and geographic
information; trade secrets; and several other
categories.
▶▶ Idaho’s

statute relating to police
investigatory records (Idaho Code §
9-335) is patterned after Exemption 7 of
the federal Freedom of Information Act.

○○ Other

records may be exempt from
disclosure through other sections of the
Idaho Code, which can be found from the
state legislature’s website.143

○○ Individuals

may access records about
themselves that would otherwise be
exempt to others. However, they may
not request records related to an ongoing
investigation.144

○○ Public information found in documents

containing confidential information should
be available upon the removal of nonpublic
information.145

○○ Monetary sanctions may include attorneys’

fees and reasonable costs to whichever
party prevails if the court finds that either
party acted frivolously or in bad faith.

• Electronic Records:
○○ Electronic records are expressly covered
in the act, though it does not specify the
format in which agencies must provide
information or whether they are required to
perform customized searches.

○○ Moreover, any public official found guilty of

more well-informed citizenry. Certain provisions
of the statute resemble its federal counterpart that
bears the same name. A strong body of case law
serves to interpret the statute. Courts often use the
federal Freedom of Information Act as an example
in their rulings. Upon adoption of the state act,
the legislature formed a statement of intent found
in Section 1. The act is intended not to further
commercial purposes149 or warrant an undue
invasion of privacy, but to “enable the people to
fulfill their duties of discussing public issues fully
and freely, making informed political judgments and
monitoring government to ensure that it is being
conducted in the public interest.”150
• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ The Illinois Freedom of Information Act
allows any person, including corporations,

further discussion on commercial use.
150 5 ILCS 140/1.

firms, associations, partnerships, and other
organizations, to request public records.
○○ The legislative intent of the act is not to

further commercial interests or engender
invasions of privacy, but the Illinois
Supreme Court ruled that this preamble
has no authoritative force151 and that the
act does not require persons to state their
intended use of the records.152

○○ The intent behind the act is to allow a

well-informed public monitor the acts of
government. It does not restrict the use of
records obtained.

• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:
○○ The act covers “any legislative, executive,
administrative, or advisory bodies of the
State, state universities and colleges,
counties, townships, cities, villages,
incorporated towns, school districts and
all other municipal corporations, boards,
bureaus, committees, or commissions of
this State, any subsidiary bodies of any of
the foregoing including but not limited
to committees and subcommittees which
are supported in whole or in part by tax
revenue, or which expend tax revenue.”153
▶▶ The act also encompasses subsidiaries of

public bodies.

▶▶ No executive or legislative agency is

exempt in its entirety, though certain
records associated with each entity may
be exempt.

○○ The act does not cover the judiciary branch,

as determined by case law and an opinion
of the Attorney General.154

or the legal rights of the general public
and is not for the principal purpose of
personal or commercial benefit.”158

○○ The act likely does not cover bodies whose

members are also public officials unless
those members act in an official capacity.

○○ The act prohibits granting exclusive rights

to access records to certain individuals

General or an ombudsman.

○○ Sanctions include attorneys’ fees to the

prevailing plaintiff.

▶▶ Additionally, courts may impose a

fine between the amounts of $2,500
and $5,000 if they find that agencies
acted in bad faith, knowingly and
willfully, in denying the public access
to records.159

▶▶ The physical format of the record

is immaterial, and the act does not
distinguish among which records are
available for inspection or copying.

• Fees and costs:
○○ Agencies may charge reasonable fees to
recover the actual costs of reproducing and
certifying public records along with the use of
any equipment necessary to copy the records.

• Exemptions:
○○ If a record is not expressly defined in a
specific, narrowly construed exemption, it
must be disclosed upon request.
○○ Moreover, the presumption of disclosure has

encouraged custodians to use exemptions at
their discretion. The statute only authorizes,
not mandates, agencies to withhold certain
documents.

furthering of commercial purposes in its
declaration of intent, this statement is not
part of the act itself and bears no authority.
○○ The Illinois Freedom of Information Act

does not prevent the use of public records
for commercial purposes.

○○ Agencies

must segregate non-exempt
material from exempt material if a public
record is requested.

• Electronic Records:

act, and the electronic formatting does not
affect a record’s openness.
▶▶ E-mails are treated as any other public

record.

▶▶ Software may be public or confidential

depending on its nature and how closely
it is related to records which are public

Access to Public Records Act
Codes: Indiana Access to Public Records Act: § 5-14-3
et seq.; Ind. Code § 4-1-10 et seq. (Regarding the release
of Social Security numbers); Administrative Rule 9
(governs judicial records)
Relevant Court Cases: Gallagher v. Marion County
Victim Advocate Program, Inc., 401 N.E.2d 1362,
1366 (Ind. App. 1980); State ex rel. Masariu v.
Marion Superior Court No.1, 621 N.E.2d 1097 (Ind.
1993); Bobrow v. Bobrow, 810 N.E.2d 726 (Ind. App.
2004); Unincorporated Operating Div. of Indiana
Newspapers v. Trs. of Indiana Univ., 787 N.E.2d 893
(Ind. App. 2003)
The Hughes Anti-Secrecy Act previously contained
Indiana’s open records provisions. The act’s
definition of public information was narrower than
that established by common law and prompted
much debate. The Access to Public Records Act
adopted in 1983 was the result of legislative research
which examined the need for revisions to the
existing statute and took into consideration other
states’ open records laws. The new law is broader in
its reach. The current statute, found in Chapter 3 of
Article 14 of Title 5 in the Indiana Code, has been
amended several times due to increasing concerns
about terrorism and considerations of personal
privacy.
• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ Any person, defined as “an individual, a
corporation, a limited liability company, a
partnership, an unincorporated association,
or a governmental entity,” may request
access to public records. 164
○○ Unless specified by another applicable

statute, the Indiana Access to Public
Records Act does not require requesters to
state the purpose for the request.165

○○ The use of public information is regulated

and restricted under the act: 166

▶▶ State and local agencies retain the

authority to limit the commercial use of

public information received on a disk or
tape.
◈◈ Persons

may use these records
for news, non-profit, or academic
purposes without restriction.

▶▶ Lists of names, addresses, and e-mail

addresses, may not be disclosed to
entities seeking to use records for
commercial or political purposes.

• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:
○○ The expansive definition found in parts
1-10 of section 5-14-3-2(m) covers all entities
“exercising any part of the executive,
administrative, judicial, or legislative power
of the state.”
○○ Though the act subjects the legislative

branch to rules of disclosure, the Indiana
Supreme Court held that it could not
enforce the statutes against the Indiana
General Assembly because it would violate
the separation of powers.167

○○ The courts are covered under the act, but

the act grants mandatory exemptions for
information which is “declared confidential
by or under rules adopted by the supreme
court of Indiana.”168
▶▶ The Indiana Supreme Court, under this

authority, has amended Administrative
Rule 9 to regulate access to judicial records.
Exemptions found therein mirror many
exemptions from the Access to Public
Records Act, though Administrative Rule
9 includes several others.

○○ Non-governmental

entities
which
receive public funding and are subject to
governmental auditing are covered under
the act.

○○ The definition of “public record” was

amended in 2003 and encompasses
materials which are “created, received,

621 N.E.2d 1097 (Ind. 1993).

retained, maintained, or filed by or with a
public agency…”169

○○ While there are no mandatory fee waivers,

custodians have the discretion to waive or
reduce fees for those seeking records for
noncommercial purposes.

▶▶ Previous acts contained the word “used”

among the verbs found in the definition
of public records. Whether this revision
will have much effect on the public’s
access to records remains to be seen.

• Enforcement and sanctions:
○○ Parties denied access to records may seek
remedy through the courts.

○○ This definition applies to all records

○○ The office of the Indiana Public Access

○○ All records open to inspection are also

available for copying unless the public agency
lacks proper facilities. In these circumstances,
the requester may resort to transcribing the
public information by hand.170

▶▶ The counselor also issues opinions

interpreting the laws, as Attorneys
General do in other states.

• Fees and costs:
○○ The Access to Public Records Act authorizes
the Indiana Department of Administration
to adopt a uniform copying fee for all state
agencies.

▶▶ Plaintiffs must seek the opinion of

the PAC in order to collect attorneys’
fees after litigating the matter in the
courts.175

○○ The Attorney General of Indiana has no

page, whichever is the greater amount.171

○○ Prevailing

parties may be awarded
attorneys’ fees and costs if the other acted
frivolously.176

○○ Other public agencies may adopt a schedule

of fees for certifying or reproducing
documents. The charge may not exceed the
actual cost, excluding labor and overhead
costs, to the agency.172

▶▶ If the agency wrongfully denied access

to records in a capricious manner, the
requester may recover litigation costs.

▶▶ Public agencies may not charge a fee for

litigation costs.

○○ Any

public employee who willfully
and knowingly discloses confidential
information is guilty of a Class A
misdemeanor.177

▶▶ A “reasonable” fee, however, is allowed

“for permitting a governmental agency
to inspect public records by means of an
electronic device.”173

○○ Various statutes throughout the Indiana

Code also set fees for certain public records.
Fees related to certain departments or
functions can be found in their respective
sections in the Code, which the Indiana
state legislature’s website provides.174

or state statute. Many others are to be
exercised at the discretion of the custodian.

▶▶ Public agencies are not required to

provide enhanced access. If they do,
however, requesters may be able to
choose a format or obtain a customary
search.

▶▶ Subsection

(a) of Section 5-14-3-4
contains 12 categories of mandatory
exemptions.

▶▶ Any person seeking enhanced access

◈◈ A few of these categories include

from a public agency, rather than
through an intermediary source, will be
required to enter into a contract with
the public agency, which may stipulate
fees.180

trade secrets, license examination
scores, medical records, and social
security numbers.

▶▶ Subsection

(b) of Section 5-14-3-4
contains 23 categories of discretionary
exemptions.

○○ For supplying a copy of a computer tape,

disk, microfilm, or other electronic form of a
public record, public agencies may charge a
fee not exceeding the direct cost, which the
act defines as 105% the sum of the initial
program development cost, labor costs, and
the cost of the medium utilized.181

◈◈ A few of these categories include

examination questions or data,
deliberative materials, personnel files,
and security-related documents.

○○ Other statutory exemptions are found

throughout the Indiana Code. The PAC
provides a handbook containing a list
of records which are statutorily exempt
from disclosure along with a list of records
agencies must disclose.178

○○ If a record contains exempt information,

the public agency must redact that material
and release the nonexempt information to
the public upon request.

• Money-Making:
○○ The Access to Public Records Act does
not explicitly authorize public agencies to
sell public information to raise revenues. It
does, however, require subdivisions of the
agencies which charge fees for enhanced
access to establish a fund to receive those
fees, which may be spent on statutorily
specified purposes only.182
○○ As mentioned, public agencies may regulate

act.

the private, commercial use of information
received on a computer disk or tape.

▶▶ E-mail is treated as public.
▶▶ Software falls under a discretionary

exemption.

○○ The act also defines the term “enhanced

access” as “the inspection of a public record
… by means of an electronic device other
than an electronic device provided by a
public agency in the office of the public
agency; or requires the compilation or
creation of a list or report that does not
result in the permanent electronic storage
of the information.”179

In response to complaints from the public regarding
inaccessible public information, the Iowa General
Assembly passed the Open Records Law in 1967.
Amendments adopted in 1988 expanded the
definition of those who could access records but also
added several exemptions. Further revisions have
since enhanced the statute’s clarity. As it stands, “[t]
he purpose of chapter 22 is to remedy unnecessary
secrecy in conducting the public’s business.”183
• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ The Iowa Open Records Law does not
restrict who may request records.

corporation… [which is] supported in whole
or in part with property tax revenue…,
or tax-supported district in this state, or
any branch, department, board, bureau,
commission, council, or committee of any
of the foregoing.”185
▶▶ The law makes no provision to exclude

the records of individual executives,
such as the state’s governor, or mayors.

▶▶ Similarly,

no exemption is made
expressly for legislative or judicial bodies.
Rather, it is the nature of the content of
the record that determines its openness,
not the body which possesses it.

▶▶ Entities which have public officials as

members are only covered if the member
is acting in an official capacity.

▶▶ Records of private investments using

public funds are also public records.186

○○ As the definition of the records covered under

the act is quite broad, the Iowa Supreme
Court has had the opportunity to clarify and
establish a test to determine which records
are indeed subject to disclosure:

• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:
○○ The statute defines “public records” as
“all records, documents, tape, or other
information, stored or preserved in any
medium, of or belonging to this state
or any county, city, township, school

“When, as is the case under section
22.7(11), a statutory exemption does
not articulate precisely what records or
information the legislature considers
private, courts commonly apply the
following factors as a means of weighing
individual privacy interests against the
public’s need to know: (1) the public
purpose of the party requesting the
information; (2) whether the purpose
could be accomplished without the
disclosure of personal information; (3)
the scope of the request; (4) whether
alternative sources for obtaining the
information exist; and (5) the gravity of
the invasion of personal privacy.”187

whole but not judges in particular.

○○ This definition includes nongovernmental

bodies which receive or are supported
by public funding. However, if an entity
receives public funds in return for goods or
services, it is not subject to the act.

Article 2 of Chapter 45 contains the Kansas Open
Records Act. Replacing its predecessor in 1984, the
current, more comprehensive statute extends beyond
records that are simply “required to be kept,” as the
repealed law had mandated. The state legislature
voted in 2000 to sunset all exceptions in 2005
unless each exception was specifically re-enacted
according to policy guidelines. The legislature in
2005, however, postponed the review until 2010.
The statute is therefore likely to change, and those
concerned with specific exemptions should check an
updated version of the Kansas Statutes Annotated
or consult a local freedom of information officer.

○○ The term “public records” is broadly defined

as “any recorded information, regardless
of form or characteristics, which is made,
maintained or kept by or is in the possession
of any public agency…”202
▶▶ This includes records related to the

investments of public funds.

▶▶ This

definition, however, exempts
records of individual legislators or
private individuals which are unrelated
to public operations.203

• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ Any person may request records in under
the Open Records Act in Kansas.198

○○ While

many states either make no
distinction or state that every record
available for inspection is likewise available
for copying, the Kansas Open Records Act
specifically states that public agencies are
not required to provide copies of discs, tapes,
films, pictures, illustrations and graphics,
and other audio and visual records.204

○○ Persons may not request or obtain records

to create or use lists of names and addresses
for commercial purposes.199
▶▶ An opinion of the Attorney General has

interpreted this provision to encompass
the names and addresses of individuals
as well as businesses.200

• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:
○○ The Kansas Open Records Act covers
records of public agencies, which are
defined as “the state or any political or
taxing subdivision of the state or any office,
officer, agency or instrumentality thereof,
or any other entity receiving or expending
and supported … by the public funds
appropriated by the state or … subdivision
of the state.”201

This may include personnel costs.
○○ The act does not supersede any other

statutory provisions that dictate a schedule
of fees for particular records or agencies.

○○ The act contains only one mandatory fee

waiver: a data processor working under a
contract to develop programs to enable
easier access may not be required to pay fees.

• Enforcement and sanctions:
○○ Any person, district attorney, or attorney
general may bring action in a district court
against a public agency under the act.
○○ Governing bodies of public agencies must

also appoint a freedom of information officer
whose role is to disseminate information
regarding public access to records and help

○○ Attorneys’ fees may be awarded to any

prevailing party.207

violating the act may face a fine not
exceeding $500 for each violation.208

F.Supp. 428 (W.D. Ky. 1996)
The Kentucky Open Records Act, enacted in 1976,
has been amended several times in response to
emerging technology and business concerns. Until
the 1994 revisions, the Public Access to Government
Databases Act governed the disclosure of electronic
records, which could be denied if the request was
made for commercial purposes. The Open Records
Act, which now encompasses electronic records,
permits the commercial use for any public record not
specifically prohibited by other statutory provisions,
though requesters may be charged additional fees for
obtaining the information.
• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ Under the Kentucky Open Records Act,
“[a]ll public records shall be opened
for inspection by any person, except as
otherwise provided . . . and suitable facilities
shall be made available by each public
agency for the exercise of this right.”211

1. Use of public records for newspapers
or periodicals,
2. Use of public records for television or
radio news programs, and
3. Use of public records for litigation
purposes.213
▶▶ Those who obtain records without

disclosing a commercial purpose may not
disclose that information to those who
will subsequently use that information
for commercial purposes.

○○ Otherwise the use of public records remains

largely unregulated.

• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:
○○ The phrase “public agency” encompasses
but is not limited to
▶▶ “Every state or local government officer;
▶▶ Any body created by state or local

authority in any branch of government;

▶▶ Any body that derives at least 25

percent of its funds expended by it in
the Commonwealth of Kentucky from

○○ Fees may differ depending on the intended
use of the records.
○○ For noncommercial purposes, agencies may

charge no more than the direct cost of
duplicating records, excluding the related
personnel costs.
▶▶ The public agency may charge staff

costs related to tailoring the records if
a person asks for a customized search or
for records in a format unlike the one in
which they are regularly stored.

○○ For commercial purposes, a person must

enter into a contract with the agency and
may be charged for personnel costs as well
as the direct cost for materials.217

○○ The Attorney General has opined that

public agencies may not charge a sales tax
in providing copies for records.218

○○ The Open Records Act makes no provisions

for fee waivers.

access to records or charged unreasonable
fees the right to complain to the state

the courts may assess a fine not in excess of

○○ Numerous exemptions within the Open

Records Act may be found in Section
61.878. Types of exempted records include
personal information, trade secrets, medical
files, examination data, preliminary drafts
or notes, and records relating to law
enforcement.
▶▶ Records

disclosure to private individuals may
be disclosed to government agencies if
doing so would serve a legitimate public

public.220

○○ The act does not supersede other statutory

exemptions found throughout the Kentucky
Revised Statutes.221

○○ Public agencies must make the non-

confidential portions of documents

the confidential material would pose
an unreasonable burden on the agency.

stored electronically. Agencies are not,
however, required to provide electronic
versions of records which exist only in print
format.222
▶▶ The standard electronic format used by

public agencies is called the American
Standard Code for Information
Interchange (ASCII) format. If a person
prefers a different format, the agency
may comply at its discretion and charge
the requester for staff costs.223

• Money-Making:
○○ The Kentucky Open Records Act does
not address whether or not the state may
generate revenues through the sale of public
records, but most records may not be sold
for more than the direct cost of reproducing
them.
○○ Private persons are permitted to use public

records for commercial purposes, unless
otherwise prohibited by other statutory
provisions. Upon revealing the intended
use of records, however, individuals may
be required to pay an increased charge for
obtaining the requested information.

○○ Fees for electronic requests that do not

require a tailored format are similar to those
assessed for other types of public records.

▶▶ For noncommercial purposes, agencies

may charge the direct cost, excluding
staff time, of providing the record,

by the public agency.”224

Diggs v. Pennington, 849 So. 2d 756 (La. App. 2003)
The Louisiana state legislature enacted the Public
Records Act in 1940. The new state constitution
adopted in 1974 established a presumption of
openness regarding the disclosure of public records,
stating, “No person shall be denied the right to
. . . examine public documents except in cases
established by law.”226 The constitutional right to
privacy, however, has frequently been used by the
courts as a catch-all exemption. The legislature
made substantial revisions to the law in 1978. One
revision expanded the definition of those who could
request records from “state electors” and “state
taxpayers” to “any person of the age of the majority.”
Another revision strengthened enforcement
procedures and made any custodian who acts
capriciously or arbitrarily in refusing access to public
records personally liable for damages to a prevailing
plaintiff.
• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ “[A]ny person of the age of majority” may
request records under the Louisiana Public
Records Act.

▶▶ Though individuals who comprise public

○○ With the exception of convicted felons,

requesters’ purpose for or intended use of
the records is immaterial. Custodians may
only ask for the age and identification of a
person making a request.229

○○ The subsequent use of public records

obtained is unrestricted. Opinions of
the Attorney General have also affirmed
individuals’ right to use public records for
commercial purposes.230

• Whose and which records are covered under
the act:
○○ The law defines a “public body” as “any
branch, department, office, agency, board,
commission, district, governing authority,
political subdivision, or any committee, …
or any other instrumentality of state, parish,
or municipal government, including a
public or quasi-public nonprofit corporation
designated as an entity to perform a
governmental or proprietary function.”231
○○ This definition embodies executive offices

excluding the Office of the Governor.
Records within the Governor’s custody or
related to the discharge of his/her duties are
exempt.232

○○ Legislative bodies are covered under the act.
○○ Courts are not specifically mentioned in the

act, though judicial agencies have been held
subject to it. The Louisiana Supreme Court
has established precedence in creating
exemptions.

○○ The act covers all records which relate to

“the conduct, transaction, or performance
of any business, transaction, work, duty,
or function …performed by or under the
authority of the constitution or laws of
this state, … any ordinance, regulation,

• Fees and costs:
○○ Custodians may charge a “reasonable fee”
established by the agency’s commissioner for
the reproduction of public records, unless a
schedule of fees is otherwise mandated by
other statutory provisions.
○○ Public agencies may not charge for the

staff time involved in searching for or
determining the confidentiality of any
record. Custodians may only charge
individuals for examining public records
if the individual does so outside of the
agency’s regular hours of operation.234

• Enforcement and sanctions:
○○ Individuals denied access to public records
have the right to pursue action in the
district court for the parish in which the
agency is located.236
▶▶ The courts have ruled that only the

person who was denied access has this
right. No one may file suit on his/her
behalf.237

▶▶ There is no prescribed role for the

Attorney General, an ombudsman, or
any particular agency or commission for
enforcement.

○○ The court may provide injunctive relief and

order the reproduction of public records.
The court may also award a successful
plaintiff reasonable attorneys’ fees and
costs.238

○○ Moreover, if the court finds that the

custodian acted arbitrarily, it may award the
plaintiff actual damages resulting from the
lack of disclosure and a fine not exceeding
$100 for each day the documents were
withheld. The custodian may be personally
liable for these charges.239

• Exemptions:
○○ Most exemptions within the Louisiana
Public Records Act are specific, and many
are discretionary.
○○ The

courts, however, have used the
constitutional right to privacy as a general,
catch-all exemption for records, balancing
the public’s right to know with the
individual’s privacy interest.240

○○ The Louisiana Revised Statutes contains

many other exemptions. Section 44:4.1
cites where in the code individuals may find
these exceptions.

○○ As mentioned, the courts have used the

constitutional right to privacy to exempt
certain documents. More specifically, the
Louisiana Supreme Court held that records
related to the bar exam were exempt, despite
the lack of statutory provisions relating to
these records. With this ruling, the court
established its “inherent authority” vested
by the legislature to create exceptions to
the Public Records Act.241

○○ Segregable

portions of confidential
documents must be made available to the
public.242

○○ The establishment of fees for electronic

records follows the same guidelines as other
types of records covered under the law. The
commissioner of each agency is to adopt
a schedule of “reasonable” fees unless a
different statutory provision applies.

• Money-Making:
○○ The Louisiana Public Records Act makes
no provisions regarding public agencies
generating a profit from the sale of public
records. While fees are not limited to the
direct material costs of reproduction (as
they are in many states), they may not
include staff time and must be “reasonable.”
○○ The law does not restrict private individuals

from using public records for commercial
purposes.

• Electronic Records:
○○ The act explicitly covers electronic records
but does not mandate whether or not public
agencies must provide a tailored format or
customized searches upon request.

its content is exempt from disclosure.

of Maine, 2005 ME 56, 871 A.2d 523
Maine’s Freedom of Access Act, sometimes referred
to as the Right to Know Law, was enacted in 1959.
Found in Chapter 13 of Title 1, the act broadly
defines the records and bodies subject to its
provisions but contains several exemptions. One
of the more expansive exceptions to disclosure is
all records that are statutorily mandated to be kept
confidential.244 Numerous exemptions therefore exist
throughout the Maine Revised Statutes. Following
an independent report on the openness of the
government in 2004, the state legislature amended
the act to establish a schedule for regularly reviewing
each title that contains exemptions.
• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ Under the Maine Freedom of Access Act,
“every person has the right to inspect and
copy any public record.”245
○○ The purpose of the request is generally

irrelevant with a few exceptions.

▶▶ For example, under certain circumstances,

○○ The records of executives themselves are

covered unless the content is purely private
or personal.

○○ Legislative

records, excluding
drafts, are also subject to the act.

○○ The judicial branch is not subject to the

uses four criteria:
1. Whether

performs

2. Whether the entity is supported with
governmental funds;
3. The extent to which the government is
involved or retains control; and
4. Whether the legislature created the

immaterial. Every record available for
inspection is likewise available for copying.

▶▶ A charge to cover the actual cost of

translation, if necessary.248

○○ Custodians may waive fees for indigent

individuals or if disclosure would serve
the public’s interest by significantly
contributing to the public’s understanding
of the government’s operations.

○○ The custodian must provide an estimate of

the time and costs necessary to fulfill the
request if the cost exceeds $20.249

• Enforcement and sanctions:
○○ Individuals denied access to public records
may within five days of receiving notice of
the denial file suit in any superior court of
the state, which has the authority to order
disclosure.
▶▶ The law does not dictate a role for the

Attorney General or an ombudsman or

in Section 402 lists exemptions relating
to medical and juvenile records, personal
information, records relating to security,
and those that are statutorily mandated
to be kept confidential.

▶▶ Sections 431 – 434 of the Freedom of

Access Act detail a process and provide
a timetable for reviewing exemptions
that exist within the state’s code.

○○ The Maine Supreme Court has no authority

to derive exemptions, only to interpret
them. The court has held that exemptions
are to be narrowly construed in favor of
disclosure.253

A.2d 1130 (2000)
Prior to the enactment of Maryland’s Public
Information Act in 1970, only persons who
demonstrated an actual or legal interest retained
the statutory and common law right to access public
records. The federal government’s adoption of the
Freedom of Information Act prompted Maryland
to codify its own statute. Using Colorado and
Wyoming statutes as models, the state legislature
passed what now provides the public with access to
open records.
• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ Any person, including partnerships, firms,
associations, government bodies, and
other entities, may request access to public
records.
▶▶ Those who are “persons of interest” may

receive greater access to certain records,
such as personnel records, that are
exempt from disclosure to the general
public.256

○○ The Public Information Act does not

restrict access to records based on the
purpose of the request.

○○ The subsequent use of information obtained

may be restricted in specific circumstances.
For example:
▶▶ “A custodian shall permit inspection,

use, or disclosure of a circulation record
of a public library only in connection
with the library’s ordinary business and

256

§ 10-616(i), (k).

62 • National Association of Counties

only for the purposes for which the
record was created.”257
▶▶ Custodians must give county auditors

access to records, but the county official
may not disclose information which
would identify the person of interest.258

▶▶ Attorneys who request police reports

related to traffic accidents, pending
criminal charges, or traffic citations filed
within the Maryland Automated Traffic
System may not disclose the records to
solicit legal services.259

• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:
○○ The act broadly defines public records and
those who must disclose them:
▶▶ “‘Public record’ means the original or

any copy of any documentary material…
made by a unit or instrumentality of
the State government or of a political
subdivision or received by the unit or
instrumentality in connection with the
transaction of public business.”260

○○ Records of the executive branch and the

executives themselves are subject to the
act.261

○○ This definition encompasses the legislative

branch, as well.

○○ The judicial branch is also subject to the

act. Common law has solidified the notion
that courts may not seal records without an
explicit statutory provision authorizing such
action.262

○○ The

courts have held that nongovernmental bodies which receive public

of the state are subject to the act.263
○○ Non-governmental bodies which receive no

public funding may also be covered if they
perform a public function, are controlled by
the government, or are immune from tort
liability.264

○○ If no agreement exists between the parties

○○ Section 10-621(e) allows custodians to

waive fees after considering “the ability
of the applicant to pay the fee and other
relevant factors.”

○○ The Maryland Court of Special Appeals

consideration:

computerized records, tapes, films, maps,

▶▶ A

○○ Generally

all records available for
inspection are also available for copying,
which should occur under the supervision
of the custodian at the location where the
record is stored unless the agency lacks the
necessary facilities.267
▶▶ A person does not have the right to

request in which format the agency
provides a copy.

• Fees and costs:
○○ Custodians may charge “reasonable” fees for
searching for, preparing, and reproducing a
requested record.268
▶▶ Custodians may not charge for the first

two hours of staff time.

▶▶ Custodians may charge for providing

facilities and supervision.

○○ Laws that mandate specific fees for records

supersede this act.

• Enforcement and sanctions:
○○ Any person who has been denied access
to public records may file a complaint in
the county circuit court either where the
complainant resides or where the record is
located.
○○ The court may order the agency to produce

the record and award attorneys’ fees and
litigation costs, as well as actual damages,
to a prevailing plaintiff. 270

○○ Additionally, the court may send a copy

of its findings to the public agency which
employs the custodian.

• Exemptions:
○○ The Public Information Act provides four
categories of exemptions.
1. Section 10-615 exempts all records that
are excluded by state or federal law or
a rule or order of a Maryland Court of
Appeals.271
2. Sections 10-616 and 10-617 exempt
specific records and specific information,
respectively.
3. Section 10-618 gives custodians the
discretion to exempt certain parts of
records if they believe disclosure would
be against the public interest.

4. Section 10-619 allows custodians to
temporarily deny access to entire records
if they believe that releasing them would
cause harm to the public. The custodian
would then petition the courts to
continue to withhold the documents.
○○ Because the Public Information Act does

not override any state or federal statute
that prohibits the disclosure of certain
documents, many statutory exemptions
exist throughout the Maryland Code.272

• Money-Making:
○○ The act stipulates that the “reasonable
fees” bear a “reasonable relationship to
the recovery of actual costs incurred by a
governmental unit.” In addition, agencies’
inability to charge for the first two hours of
personnel time likely prevents profits from
the sale of public records.
○○ The commercial use of public records

by private individuals is restricted under
specific circumstances. For example:

○○ Segregable portions of otherwise exempt

▶▶ As

mentioned, attorneys may not
use police reports concerning traffic
accidents or citations or pending
criminal charges to solicit services.

material may be provided if the cost to the
agency is not too burdensome.273

• Electronic Records:
○○ The act explicitly covers electronic records.

▶▶ In general, those who access a record

unavailable to others, such as student
records,275 may not disclose the
information therein, for commercial or
any other purpose.

▶▶ E-mails are treated as any other form of

public records.

▶▶ Information

system software, with
the exception of the portions which
are related to security, are subject to
disclosure.274

○○ Public agencies are not required to provide

records in any particular format upon
request, though it is encouraged if the task
would not be burdensome.

○○ The Public Information Act does not

establish separate provisions for fees for
providing public records in an electronic
format. The same guidelines apply.

Traditions of open government date back to colonial
times in Massachusetts. The first statutory provision
was enacted in 1851 and established the public’s right
to access governmental documents. Revisions in
the 1970s expanded public access to all documents
that were not exempt by narrowly construed
exceptions. Judicial decisions act to interpret the
existing exceptions rather than creating common
law exceptions. The provisions collectively referred
to as the “Public Records Law” can be found in
two chapters of the Massachusetts General Laws.
Clause 26 of Section 7 in Chapter 4 defines the
phrase “public records.” Chapter 66 further details
the procedures surrounding access to public
records. Finally, these provisions are supplemented
by the administrative regulations set forth in the
Code of Massachusetts Regulations. Overall, these
statutes are patterned after the federal Freedom of
Information Act “in a general way.”276
• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ “Any person” may request access to public
records.277 Though not specifically defined
in this statute, this term likely includes
non-residents of the state and foreigners.

277 G.L. c. 66, § 10(a).

○○ The requester’s purpose is immaterial.

Custodians may not inquire as to the
intended use of the public record.278
▶▶ Commercial use is not prohibited.

○○ The law does not restrict the subsequent

use of public information.

• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:
○○ The Public Records Law covers materials
“made or received by any officer or employee
of any agency, executive office, department,
board, commission, bureau, division or
authority of the Commonwealth, or of
any political subdivision thereof, or of any
authority established by the [Legislature] to
serve a public purpose.”279
○○ At the state level, this definition includes

records of the executive branch. At the
county and municipal levels, the definition
encompasses all records, except those which
are statutorily exempt.

▶▶ The executives themselves are covered

under the act. Common law has not
recognized the doctrines of an executive
privilege or a deliberative process
privilege.280

▶▶ However,

“inter-agency or intraagency memoranda or letters relating
to policy positions being developed
by the agency” are exempt. Once the
deliberative process is complete and the
policy decided, the working documents
are public.281

public records. This fee should be “based on
the hourly rate of the lowest paid employee
capable of performing the task.”288

○○ The Public Records Law does not explicitly

cover non-public entities that receive public
funding. Courts have ruled that receiving
public funds does not make a private body
public.284

○○ Regulations encourage, but do not require,

custodians to waive fees for accessing public
records “where disclosure would benefit the
public interest.”289

○○ Likewise, bodies whose members also serve

Common law right to access public information
dates back to 1889. The enactment of Michigan’s
Freedom of Information Act in 1977 codified the
open records law in sections 15.231 – 15.246 of the
Michigan Compiled Laws Annotated. Courts have
since interpreted the statute as favoring disclosure
with narrowly construed exemptions. The statute
also provides courts the authority to assess punitive
damages against agencies which wrongfully and
arbitrarily deny access to public records.

○○ This definition encompasses the executive

branch, as well as the executives themselves.

○○ The legislative branch, however, is excluded

from the act.

The Minnesota Government Data Practices Act,
found in Chapter 13 of the Minnesota Statutes,
“establishes a presumption that government data
are public and are accessible by the public for both
inspection and copying unless there is federal law,
a state statute, or a temporary classification of data
that provides that certain data are not public.”315
Relatively few court cases address the topic of open
records. The statute provides some of the highest
possible monetary sanctions against those who
willfully violate its provisions, authorizing courts to
assess damages up to $15,000.

▶▶ After a controversial discovery in 1993

regarding personal use of long-distance
telephone cards funded by the state, new
legislation was enacted to make those
specific records public.318

○○ The courts are not governed by the

Michigan Government Data Practices Act,
but rather the Rules of Public Access to
Records of the Judicial Branch. The Rules
generally favor disclosure but exempt several
categories of records that would constitute
an undue invasion of privacy.

• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ Any “person” may request public records.
The term “person” includes “any individual,
partnership, corporation, association, business trust, or a legal representative of an
organization.”316

○○ The act covers nonprofit organizations

which is either

▶▶ “A community action agency organized

pursuant to the Economic Opportunity
Act of 1964 (Public Law 88-452) as
amended, to qualify for public funds, or

○○ Requesters

are not required to state
the purpose of the request. The only
circumstance under which the purpose
of the request may be material is if the
courts decide to take this factor under
consideration when balancing privacy rights
against the public interest in disclosure.

▶▶ Any nonprofit social service agency

which performs services under contract
to a government entity, to the extent
that …[it] collects, stores, disseminates,
and uses data on individuals because
of a contractual relationship with a
government entity.”319

○○ The

subsequent use of records is
unrestricted. In fact, the law recognizes that
commercial use may be the intent of the
request without prohibiting that purpose.

• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:
○○ The act encompasses state agencies, defined
as “any office, officer, department, division,
315
316

Minn.Stat. § 13.01, subd. 3.
Minn.Stat. § 13.02, subd. 10.

○○ The act includes all data, regardless of

format or physical characteristics.

○○ Agencies must keep data “in such an

arrangement and condition as to make
them easily accessible for convenient use,”
and all which is available for inspection is
also available for copying.321

• Enforcement and sanctions:
○○ Anyone denied access to data may seek
an opinion from the Commissioner of
Administration. Public agencies are not
bound by these opinions, but courts must
defer to them in any proceedings regarding
the request.325
○○ Individuals aggrieved by public agencies’

• Fees and costs:
○○ The act does authorize agencies to levy fees
for providing reproductions of public data.
Agencies may not, however, charge persons
for inspecting public records.322

decisions may also pursue action in district
court. The courts have the authority to do
any or all of the following:
▶▶ Provide injunctive relief by issuing an

order requiring disclosure,

○○ Custodians may charge the actual cost

of duplication, including the personnel
costs associated with searching for and
retrieving the data.

▶▶ Award attorneys’ fees and costs to the

prevailing plaintiff,

▶▶ Award damages between $1,000 and

▶▶ The custodian may not, however,

$15,000,

charge for separating confidential data
from public records.

▶▶ Assess a civil penalty up to $1,000

against the agency for willful violations
of the act. 326

▶▶ The act does provide one very specific

limitation: for requests of fewer than
100 pages of letter or legal sized paper
in black and white, charges are limited
to 25 cents per page.323

may charge an additional
“reasonable fee” if the requested data “has
commercial value and is a substantial and
discrete portion of or an entire formula,
pattern, compilation, program, device,
method, technique, process, database,
or system developed with a significant
expenditure of public funds by the
government entity.” The public agency
must be able to justify the fee, which
should be related to the actual costs of
developing the information.324

○○ Moreover, the act states, “Any person

who willfully violates the provisions of
this chapter or any rules adopted under
this chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor.
Willful violation of this chapter by any
public employee constitutes just cause for
suspension without pay or dismissal of the
public employee.”327

○○ Custodians

○○ The statute contains no provisions for fee

waivers or reductions.

○○ Public employees and agencies are immune

from liability if they act in accordance
with an opinion of Commissioner of
Administration or follow the guidelines in
Subsections 4-6 of Section 13.08.

• Exemptions:
○○ The Minnesota Government Data Practices
Act contains numerous specific exemptions
from its broad definition of “government
data.”
○○ Many records containing private, personal

information are accessible only to the
person of interest within the record. Other
records are inaccessible to all.

○○ The act provides several categories of

public health, medical, investigatory, and
security-related data. These exemptions
are found between Subsections 13.10 and
13.90.328

○○ If agencies maintain data in an electronic

format, a person has the right to request a
copy of the data in that format if the agency
“can reasonably make the copy or have a
copy made.”329

○○ As the act does not supersede any other

statutory exemption, many are found
throughout the Minnesota Statutes. The
Government Data Practices Act often
cites the sections under which exemptions
related to each category may be found.

○○ Fees for data provided in electronic form are

assessed in the same manner as other forms
of records. Agencies may charge for the
actual costs of searching for and retrieving
and transmitting the copies of the data.
Personnel time may be included, though
the time spent separating confidential data
from public data is not.

○○ Beyond the permanent, specific exemptions,

Section 13.06 provides a general, but
temporary, exemption. A public agency
must apply to the Minnesota Department
of Administration to receive permission
to keep data private until the legislature
has time to address the type of data
under request. The Commissioner of
Administration has 45 days to grant or
reject the application.

• Electronic Records:
○○ The act covers electronic records which
contain government data.
▶▶ Because the act addresses data, rather

than records themselves, e-mails are
presumably covered if they contain
government data.

▶▶ If a person requests a customized

search, additional fees for searching and
retrieving the records may apply.

▶▶ If the data has commercial value, a

reasonable, justifiable fee may be added.

• Money-Making:
○○ Public agencies may charge a reasonable
fee for providing data of commercial value;
however, the law specifies that this fee must
“relate to the actual development costs of
the information.”330
○○ Commercial use by individuals is permitted.

▶▶ Software is exempt and treated as a

trade secret if the public agency has
patented it. Otherwise, agencies may
charge additional fees to cover the cost
of developing the program.

(Washington County Chancery Ct., 1986); Roberts
v. Miss. Republican Party State Executive Comm., 465
So. 2d 1050 (Miss. 1985)
Common law access to public records dates back to
court decisions of 1941. It was not until forty years
later, however, that the public’s right to inspect
and copy public records was codified in Chapter
61 of Title 25 in the Mississippi Code. Due to its
relatively recent enactment and the availability
of a commission to mediate disputes, case law
interpreting the act is somewhat limited. Insight
into the interpretation of the act primarily stems
from opinions of the Attorney General.

○○ The subsequent use of public information is

unrestricted.

• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:
○○ The act regulates the records of “public
bodies” which are defined as “any
department, bureau, division, council,
commission, committee, subcommittee,
board, agency and any other entity of the
state or a political subdivision thereof, and
any municipal corporation and any other
entity created by the Constitution or by
law...”
○○ This

definition covers executive and
legislative agencies, as well as the courts.
▶▶ However, executives, legislators, and

judges themselves are exempt, as “the
term ‘entity’ shall not be construed to
include individuals employed by a public
body or any appointed or elected public
official.” 333

▶▶ Moreover, the act enables the legislature

• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ The Mississippi Public Records Act grants
“any person … the right to inspect, copy
or mechanically reproduce or obtain a
reproduction of any public record of a public
body.”331

to adopt its own regulations for allowing
access to public records.334

▶▶ Though the courts are covered, certain

statutes exempt the records developed
among judges and between judges and
their aides,335 as well as records among
juries regarding judicial decisions.336

○○ The purpose of the request is generally

immaterial.

○○ Bodies which receive public funding or are

▶▶ The purpose or identity of the person

comprised of public officials are not subject
to the act unless that entity was “created by
the Constitution, or by law, executive order,
ordinance or resolution.”337

requesting records may affect access to
those records when the person is the
subject of those otherwise confidential
records. These provisions may be found
within clauses outside the Public Records
Act that exempt certain materials from
disclosure.

○○ The act defines “public records” as “all

books, records, papers, accounts, letters,
maps, photographs, films, cards, tapes,
… and any other documentary materials,

○○ All records open to inspection are also

• Fees and costs:
○○ The statute provides no specific limitation
on fees but authorizes agencies to charge
reasonable fees no greater than the actual
cost of providing access to public records.
These charges may include:
▶▶ Personnel cost related to searching and

reviewing records,

▶▶ Direct cost of duplicating records, and
▶▶ If applicable, the cost of mailing the

records.338

○○ In addition, agencies may charge for

the time spent redacting confidential
information from public records.339

○○ The act does not provide for fee waivers,

but the use of the word “may” implies that
custodians have discretion in establishing a
schedule of fees. Indeed, many records are
available online at no charge.

• Enforcement and sanctions:
○○ Individuals denied access to public records
may appeal to the Ethics Commission and
request an opinion from the commission.
The law is unclear as to whether opinions
are binding on the agency, but the courts
must take these into consideration should a
dispute arise.
▶▶ The

Ethics Commission may also
mediate disputes between agencies and
requesters.340

▶▶ The act provides no role for the Attorney

chancery court in the county in which the
public agency is located. The court may
impose sanctions against any public agency
found guilty of willfully violating the act
including:
records,

▶▶ Reasonable

litigation costs to the
prevailing plaintiff, and

▶▶ A fine up to $100.341

• Exemptions:
○○ Exemptions under the Public Records Act
are specific and mostly discretionary with
the exception of the catch-all exemption
that covers all records deemed confidential
by “constitutional or statutory law or
decision of a court of this state or the
United States.”342
○○ Two other sections in the act enumerate

specific exemptions:

▶▶ Section 25-61-9 exempts trade secrets

and other confidential financial and
commercial data, records related to
waste minimization plans under the
Mississippi Comprehensive Multimedia
Waste Minimization Act of 1990, and
data processing software which the
agency obtained pursuant to a licensing
agreement.

▶▶ Section

25-61-12 exempts personal
information of law enforcement, judicial
and prosecutorial personnel and that of
victims of crimes.

○○ Many other statutory exemptions exist, as

the act does not supersede other state or
federal laws regarding open records. The
state legislature’s website contains a link
to the full state code which has provisions
regarding other exemptions and privileges
as they relate to specific types of records.343

○○ The courts also have the authority to create

Publishing Co. v. Missouri State Employees’ Retirement
System, 927 S.W.2d 477 (Mo.Ct.App. 1996)
The Missouri code contains two statutes which
regulate the public’s access to government records.
The Sunshine Law, followed by the Arrest Records
Law, is found in Chapter 610 of the Missouri Revised
Statutes. Originally enacted in 1973, the law states a
policy intent of disclosure which has been supported
and upheld by decades of case law. Chapter 109
contains the Missouri Public Records Law, which
was enacted in 1961. This statute is more limited in
scope and applies only to records which agencies are
required by statute to keep. Though most records
obtainable under the Public Records Law could be
accessible through the Sunshine Law, the lack of
exemptions found in the Public Records Law affects
the likelihood of disclosure.
• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ Under the Sunshine Law:
▶▶ Any member of the public may request

access to public records.346 The Sunshine
Law does not restrict access based on
citizenry.

○○ Under the Public Records Law:
▶▶ Only Missouri citizens are granted

access to public records.347

346
347

Mo.Rev.Stat. §§ 610.010-.030.
Mo.Rev.Stat. § 109.180.

○○ Requesters’ purpose is generally immaterial

under both acts.

▶▶ However, persons of interest may have

greater access to certain records that are
covered by other statutory exemptions
outside the act.348

○○ The two acts do not restrict the subsequent

use of public information.

▶▶ Other statutory exemptions, however,

limit the use of information. For
example information from certain
records governed by the Vital Records
Law may be used only for “legitimate
research purposes.”349

• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:
○○ Under the Sunshine Law:
▶▶ “Public

governmental bodies” and
“quasi-public governmental bodies,”350
which include the legislative and
executive branches of state and local
governments, as well as the governing
bodies of institutions of higher learning
which are supported by state funds, are
covered.351

▶▶ The records of executives themselves are

subject to the act, even those which are
deliberative or preliminary in nature.352

▶▶ The Sunshine Law also covers advisory

boards and commissions and entities
which do business in the state and are
regulated by the provisions of Chapters
352, 353, or 355. If the organization’s
primary purpose is to perform “activities
carried out pursuant to an agreement or
agreements with public governmental
bodies” or any other “public function,”

▶▶ The act was also amended to include any

“bi-state development agency established
pursuant to Section 70.370, RSMo.”354

▶▶ Moreover, the courts have established

a strong common law right of access to

remaining material.

and the legislative branch are covered
only if statutes and ordinances require
the requested records to be kept. Many
records relating to the decision-making
process are therefore likely exempt from
disclosure.

▶▶ The

Public Records Law provides
no restrictions based on the physical
format of the information requested
but simply refers to “records, documents
or instruments.”357 However, courts
have ruled that access to records under
the Public Records Law is subject
to “reasonable rules and conditions
imposed by proper authorities.”358 If
providing data in a particular medium
is deemed unreasonable by the “proper
authority,” access may not be granted.

○○ The Sunshine Law and the Public Records

Law do not cover judicial records, except
when the courts act in an administrative
capacity.359 Other provisions apply:

tution states that “the courts of justice

and common law.

• Fees and costs:
○○ Under the Sunshine Law, custodians may
charge fees comprised of the following:
▶▶ Ten cents per page for the direct

materials cost,

▶▶ An hourly charge not greater than the

average hourly rate for clerical staff
of the public entity for the time spent
duplicating records,

▶▶ The actual cost of research time.
◈◈ Public agencies must provide copies

at the lowest possible cost and must
provide an estimate upon request.

◈◈ Custodians may waive or reduce

charges if doing so would serve the
public interest “because it is likely
to contribute significantly to public
understanding of the operations or
activities of the public governmental
body and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.”362

○○ The Public Records Law vaguely states that

a custodian may charge “a reasonable rate
for his services … and for the use of the
room or place where the work is done.”363

• Enforcement and sanctions:
○○ “Any aggrieved person, taxpayer to, or
citizen of, this state, or the attorney general
or prosecuting attorney” may file action in
the circuit court of the county in which
the public agency has its principal place of
business under the Sunshine Law.364
○○ The Sunshine Law imposes civil penalties

in addition to attorneys’ fees not exceeding
$1,000 against those who knowingly violate
the Law.365 The fine may reach $5,000 for a
purposeful violation.366

○○ Public agencies are required to provide pub-

lic information separated from otherwise
confidential material.369

• Electronic Records:
○○ Missouri adopted Section 610.029 in 1993
to address the issue of electronic records.
Amended in 2004, this provision encourages
public agencies to provide access to records
in electronic format and stipulates that a
governmental agency may not enter into a
contract that would consequently hinder
access to records.

○○ Under the Public Records Law, public

▶▶ E-mail is treated as public.370

officials guilty of violating the act may be
subject to removal from office and guilty
of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of
no more than $100 and/or 90 days in the
county jail.367

▶▶ Software, however, may be exempt.371
○○ If records are kept in an electronic format,

custodians must provide them in that
format upon request.372

○○ Agencies are authorized, but not required,

• Exemptions:
○○ The Public Records Law provides no explicit
exemptions. Court rulings have granted
custodians the authority to adopt their own
rules, which likely govern exceptions to

○○ Fees for providing electronic access to

public records may include:

▶▶ The direct material cost of any disk or

other medium provided,

○○ Exemptions, which are narrowly construed

• Money-Making:
○○ No provision enables public agencies to
account for commercial value in assessing
fees for providing access to public records.
○○ The use of public records by private

individuals is not restricted by the Sunshine
or Public Records Laws.

○○ The Missouri Revised Statutes contain

many other exemptions relating to specific
categories found in their respective sections

• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:
○○ Rather than defining which entities are
subject to the act, the Public Records Act
broadly defines the term “public records”
as “the written acts or records of the acts
of the sovereign authority, of official
bodies and tribunals, and of public officers,
legislative, judicial, and executive, whether
of this state, of the United States, of a sister
state, or of a foreign country, except records
that are constitutionally protected from
disclosure.”376
○○ Records of the executive branch are covered

by the state constitution and the Public
Records Act unless otherwise specifically
exempted.

Montana enacted its first open records law in
1895, six years after achieving statehood. This law
provided a statutorily guaranteed right to access
public records. When the state legislature rewrote
the Montana Constitution in 1972, this guarantee
was elevated to a constitutional level. The courts
now apply a balancing test to weigh the interest of
disclosure against the interest of personal privacy.

▶▶ Moreover, state law requires municipali-

ties to make records available for public
inspection with the exception of personal or medical records or “when the right
to individual privacy or law enforcement
security exceeds the merits of public
disclosure.”377

○○ The act contains no exemption for the

• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ Though the Public Record Act grants
“every citizen” the right to inspect and copy
public writings, the Montana Constitution
states that no one “shall be deprived of the
right to examine documents or to observe
the deliberations of all public bodies or
agencies.”374 Because the constitutional
provision takes precedence over the state
statute, the broader scope applies, and
any person, regardless of citizenship, may
request access to public records.

legislative or judicial branches.

○○ The Public Records Act remains silent as

to whether or not nongovernmental groups
must disclose their records to the public.
The state constitution, however, provides
access to records of public bodies as defined
by the open meetings statute, which
does include entities supported by public
funding.378

○○ Whether or not multi-state bodies or entities

comprised of public officials are also subject
to the act remains largely unaddressed and
is likely decided on a case-by-case basis.

• The purpose of the request only matters if the
requester must demonstrate a strong public
interest that outweighs the interest of privacy.375
• The law does not restrict the subsequent use of
public information.

• Fees and costs:
○○ The Public Records Act authorizes
custodians to provide copies of public
records “on payment of the legal fees for
the copy” but does not establish a specific
schedule of fees for print sources.379
○○ However, if treated like non-print media,

the fees are likely limited to reasonable or
actual costs of reproducing the requested
records.

○○ In accordance with an executive order from

the governor in 1996, state government
agencies customarily charge 10 cents per
page for copies of agency records.

○○ The Public Records Act contains no

provisions for mandatory fee waivers.

• Enforcement and sanctions:
○○ Those denied access to records may appeal
to the district court of the county where the
custodian resides. The court or judge then
has the authority to order the disclosure of
the requested material.380
○○ The Attorney General has no prescribed

role but may issue advisory opinions
interpreting and applying the statute.

○○ Though the act provides no provisions for

sanctions, any prevailing plaintiff who
brings suit under Article II, Section 9 of the
constitution may be awarded attorneys’ fees
and litigation costs.381

• Exemptions:
○○ The Montana Constitution establishes a
general standard for creating exemptions.
It states that no person should be denied
access to records unless “the demand of
individual privacy clearly exceeds the
merits of public disclosure.”382
▶▶ As this provision requires a balancing

test, this general exemption may be
considered discretionary.

▶▶ A wealth of case law has established

a balancing test which first asks
whether the person of interest had an

expectation of privacy and then whether
that expectation was reasonable. If the
answer to either of those questions is
no, then the information is open to
the public. If the answer to both is yes,
then the court must weigh the merits of
privacy as opposed to disclosure.383
○○ The Public Records Act specifically adds

exceptions for “legitimate trade secrets”
and “matters related to individual or public
safety.”384

○○ Many other exemptions exist throughout

the state code and cover specific categories,
such as adoption records (§ 40-8-126),
criminal justice information (§§ 44-5-103
and 44-5-302), and insurance company
auditing reports (§ 33-1-412).385

○○ The Montana Supreme Court has yet to

address whether or not public information
in documents containing confidential
material may be segregated, but the
Attorney General has opined that nonexempt information should be made
available under the Montana Criminal
Justice Information Act.386

• Electronic Records:
○○ Electronic information is covered and is
treated like printed materials under the
Public Records Act.
▶▶ E-mail, though largely unaddressed, is

presumably public.

▶▶ The statute and case law likewise gloss

over the openness of software. Whether
it is public likely depends on its origin,
purpose, and any applicable proprietary
laws.

○○ People may request and obtain customized

searches or tailored formats of electronic
information.

• Money-Making:

State ex rel. Upper Republican Natural Resources
District v. District Judges of the District Court for
Chase County, 273 Neb. 148, 728 N.W.2d 275 (2007)
Nebraska’s Public Records Law, found in Section
712 of Chapter 84 in the Nebraska Revised Statutes,
encompasses all branches of government at every
level. A relatively brief statute in comparison to
other states’ open records laws, the Nebraska Public
Records Law enumerates only 18 exemptions.
However, many more exist throughout the state code.

○○ The statute also does not address whether

multi-state or regional bodies or bodies
whose members are also public officials are
covered.

○○ All records in possession of the state,

regardless of physical characteristics, are
subject to disclosure unless otherwise exempt.

○○ Anyone may examine records and obtain

copies using their own equipment or that of
the public agency.392

• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ Nebraska’s Public Records Law allows “all
citizens of this state, and all other persons
interested in the examination of the public
records,”389 to access public records.

• Fees and costs:
○○ The fees levied for the reproduction of
public records depend on the medium in
which they were produced. This section will
discuss the print sources, with the fees for
electronic records appearing further below.

○○ In Nebraska statutes, the term “person”

○○ If a person is simply inspecting records

generally encompasses “bodies politic and
corporate, societies, communities, the
public generally, individuals, partnerships,
joint stock companies, and associations.”390

or uses his/her own resources for making
copies, no fee may be charged.393

○○ Custodians may charge reasonable fees

which “shall not exceed the actual cost
of making the copies available.” This
may include the material costs as well as
personnel costs incurred in providing copies
of public records.394

○○ The purpose for the request is immaterial,

and the subsequent use of records remains
unrestricted.

• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:
○○ The act defines “public records” as “all
records and documents, regardless of physical
form, of or belonging to this state, any
county, city, village, political subdivision,
or tax-supported district in this state, or any
agency, branch, department, board, bureau,
commission, council, subunit, or committee
of any of the foregoing.”391

○○ Other statutes specify costs for certain

records. For example, Section 71-612
outlines fees for certified copies of death,
birth, and marriage certificates.

○○ If the cost of providing copies is likely to

exceed $50, the custodian may require an
advance deposit prior to producing the copies.

○○ Veterans may obtain free certified copies

of records related to claims before the the
United States Department of Veterans
Affairs.395

○○ This definition covers the executive, legisla-

tive, and judicial branches. Records, not public entities, may be exempt under statutes.

○○ This definition does not exempt the

The common law right to access public records dates
as far back as 1906 in Nevada, though the requester
had to show some interest in the requested records
at that time.407 Five years later, the state legislature
passed the state’s first open records act, which
remains little changed today. Found in Chapter 239
under Title 19, the act enables courts and public
agencies to utilize a balancing test to weigh the
merits of disclosure.
• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ The Open Records Act allows “any person”
to request access to records.408
○○ Generally the purpose of the request

does not affect that person’s right to
access records. Reporters, however, are
statutorily entitled to greater access to
records regarding criminal history “for
communication to the public.”409

○○ The act vaguely covers “all public books

and public records of a governmental
entity” without defining the terms “public
books” or “public records.” These terms may
therefore be construed to include all that is
not specifically exempted by the act, other
statutes, or court orders.
▶▶ The physical format is likely immaterial.
▶▶ The public has the right to inspect and

copy records.

• Fees and costs:
○○ Sections 239.052 – 239.055 authorize
custodians to charge fees for providing copies
of public records.
○○ In general, agencies may not charge more

than the actual cost of a copy of the record,
and agencies must post a schedule of fees
where requesters may view it.

○○ The act does not restrict the subsequent use

of any public information provided.

○○ Additional fees may be charged under the

following circumstances:

• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:
○○ The Open Records Act defines “governmental entity” as the following:

▶▶ The request is for a transcript of an

administrative proceeding which was
transcribed by a certified court reporter.

▶▶ “An elected or appointed officer of this

▶▶ The request requires “extraordinary use of

▶▶ Fees tend to vary from agency to agency.

Some may charge for the use of public

Paquette, 132 N.H. 415 (1989)
Enacted in 1976, Chapter 91A of the New
Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated contains
the “Right to Know Law,” which relates to both open
records and open meetings. The preamble of the act,
added one year after its adoption, states “Openness
in the conduct of public business is essential to a
democratic society. The purpose of this chapter is to
ensure both the greatest possible public access to the
actions, discussions and records of all public bodies,
and their accountability to the people.” Article 8
of Part 1 of the New Hampshire Constitution also
stresses the importance of openness: “Government,
therefore, should be open, accessible, accountable
and responsive. To that end, the public’s right of
access to governmental proceedings and records
shall not be unreasonably restricted.”
• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ The open records portion of the act
allows “every citizen” to request access to
public record. The open meetings portion,
however, enables “every person” to attend
public meetings. The term “citizen” is
therefore not likely to limit any person’s
ability to access public records.425
○○ The purpose of the request is immaterial.

• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:
○○ The statute covers “governmental records”
which means “any information created,
accepted, or obtained by, or on behalf of,
any public body.”426
○○ The term “public body” encompasses the

following:

▶▶ The legislature and its committees;
▶▶ All agencies of the state executive

branch (with the exception of the
Department of Employment Security);

▶▶ Commissions, boards, and advisory com-

mittees established by public bodies;427

▶▶ Nonprofit

corporations
public services.428

performing

○○ This definition does not include the courts.

Access to judicial records, however, may be
obtained using Part I, Articles 8 and 22 of
the New Hampshire Constitution.

○○ In addition, the Attorney General has stated

that the Governor’s Office is not covered
under the act, though these records may
be accessible through the constitutional
provisions.

○○ All physical forms of records are covered.
○○ The statute makes no distinction among

which are available for copying and which
are open to inspection only.

• Fees and costs:
○○ Agencies are authorized to charge fees not
in excess of the actual cost of providing
copies of public records. The act does not
state whether this may or may not include
personnel costs incurred in providing access
to records.

○○ The act does not restrict the subsequent use

public of information.

○○ If the legislature establishes a specific fee,

however, the public entity may not levy any
additional charges.429

○○ The statute does not require agencies to

impose fees, though such charges may not
be waived or reduced if dictated by statute.

• Enforcement and sanctions:
○○ The Right to Know Law states that “[a]
ny person aggrieved by a violation of this
chapter may petition the superior court for
injunctive relief.”430
○○ If the custodian wrongfully and knowingly

denied access to public records, the public
body will be liable for reasonable attorneys’
fees and costs.

○○ If the custodian acted in bad faith, these

fees may be charged against the custodian
personally.

○○ If the person denied access to records brings

a lawsuit frivolously, he/she may be liable
for the public agency’s attorneys’ fees and
costs.431

○○ Section 91-A:9 states that anyone who

“knowingly destroys any information with
the purpose to prevent such information
from being inspected or disclosed in
response to a request under this chapter” is
guilty of a misdemeanor.

○○ There is no prescribed role for the Attorney

General in enforcement, though the office
does disseminate information to public
agencies and the public regarding the Right
to Know Law.

○○ The statute establishes a Right-to-Know

providing access to public records.432

• Exemptions:
○○ The Right to Know Law contains several
specific exemptions in Section 91-A: 5,
including grand and petit jury records,
school records, personal information, and
preliminary drafts.
○○ Section 91-A: 5, IV contains a general,

catch-all phrase that exempts “other files
whose disclosure would constitute invasion
of privacy.”

○○ The courts therefore use a balancing test

which has become more refined as case law
has handled privacy issues over time.

▶▶ For example, in Lamy v. New Hampshire

Public Utilities Commission, the court
applied a three-pronged analysis to
measure the invasion of privacy and
weigh that against the public interest in
disclosure.433

○○ Other statutory exemptions exist through-

out New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated. For example, welfare records, child
abuse reports, motor vehicle records, and
records relating to police investigations are
not subject to disclosure.434

○○ When exemptions apply to portions of doc-

uments, the remaining public information
may be made available.435

• Electronic Records:
○○ Electronic records are covered under the
act.
▶▶ Courts have ruled that the e-mails of

individual legislators are not public but
those of public agencies as a whole are.436

▶▶ Software remains unaddressed in the

statute.

Entertainment v. Division of Alcoholic Beverage

In 2002, New Jersey replaced its previous Right to
Know Act with the current Open Public Records
Act, found in Title 47 of the New Jersey Statutes
Annotated. More detailed in prescribing the
processes of requesting and obtaining records, the
new act also establishes a Government Records
Council. The council hears complaints, issues
opinions, establishes guidelines, and disseminates
information to public agencies and individuals
regarding open records practices.
• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ The Open Public Records Act grants any
“citizen of this State” access to public records. N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.
▶▶ Common law suggests that the requester

should demonstrate some interest in
the information sought. The media,
however, usually has access, as reporters
act as the “eyes and ears of the public.”437

○○ The purpose of the request is immaterial.
▶▶ Common law, however, dictates that

purpose may be a relevant factor to
outweigh the governmental interest in
confidentiality.438

○○ Only when records are obtained under

common law rights may the courts regulate
the subsequent use of the information.439
When the Open Public Records Act
declares a record to be open, the use is
unrestricted.

• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:
○○ The statute applies to “any officer,
commission, agency or authority of the
State or of any political subdivision thereof,”
which covers the executive and legislative
branches.
▶▶ The judicial branch is not specifically

addressed but is governed by New Jersey
Court Rules which deem court records to
be open unless specifically exempted.440

○○ Certain functions of the executive branch

are not considered public:

▶▶ Records which fall under an executive

privilege or subject to a grant of
confidentiality recognized by the state
constitution, statutes, court rules, or
case law;

▶▶ Portions

of records which contain
advisory or deliberative information,
or any other records protected by an
established privilege;

▶▶ Portions

of records which contain
information that the sender, an
identifiable person outside the Office
of the Governor, is not required to
provide if disclosure would constitute an
unwarranted invasion of privacy.441

○○ Certain functions of the legislative branch

are also exempt:

▶▶ Information legislators receive from a

constituent or about a constituent is
not public unless the law required the
information to be sent;

2005-NMCA-22, 106 P.3d 1273
Common law right to access and inspect certain
public records dates back to 1925 in New Mexico.452
The state’s first Open Records Law was passed
in 1947, though it failed to clearly define public
records and limited access to “citizens” only. The
legislature added more exceptions in 1973. Twenty
years later, the act underwent a thorough overhaul.
Public agencies became liable for court costs and
damages, though the imprisonment sanctions for
violators were eradicated. The legislature established
procedures and exemptions modeled after the
federal Freedom of Information Act. The revised
statute includes a statement of legislative intent
that engenders a policy that favors disclosure, as “a
representative government is dependent upon an
informed electorate.”453

▶▶ Section 14-3-15(C)(2) prohibits the com-

mercial or political use of computerized
databases. This issue remains unaddressed by the courts but may be of questionable constitutionality given the previously mentioned precedent.

• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:
○○ The act applies to “public bodies” which
include “the executive, legislative and
judicial branches of state and local
governments and all advisory boards,
commissions, committees, agencies or
entities created by the constitution or any
branch of government that receives any
public funding.”456
○○ As clearly stated, the executive branch and

presumably the executives themselves are
subject to the act. The Attorney General
has, however, noted an “executive privilege”
as an exemption to the act.

○○ The legislative branch is expressly covered.
○○ While the statute does include the judicial

branch, the courts have not yet addressed

not they receive public funding, are not

○○ Section 14-2-9(B) authorizes custodians to
charge a reasonable fee for providing copies
of public records.
○○ The fee may not exceed one dollar for any

page the size of 11” x 17” or smaller.

○○ Custodians may require advance payment

but may not charge for the time spent
determining whether or not the requested
records are subject to disclosure.

○○ The Attorney General has issued opinions

stating that fees should not exceed the
actual cost of copying.

○○ The language of the statute states that

custodians “may charge” fees, which would
seem to allow discretion. A fee waiver,
however, may be ruled unconstitutional
based on the New Mexico Anti-Donation
clause.

to those requesting records required by

of the public agency and may not exceed
$100 for each day the records were not
provided.459

• Exemptions:
○○ Section 14-2-1(A) lists 12 specific and likely
discretionary exemptions to the definition
of “public records.”
○○ A few of these include trade secrets, medical

records, discharge papers, and security
related plans.

○○ The Inspection of Public Records Act also

contains a clause that exempts all other
records “as otherwise provided by law.”460

▶▶ The New Mexico Statutes Annotated

contains more than 100 other
exemptions scattered throughout the
code.461

○○ The New Mexico Supreme Court has used a

vague “balancing test” to weigh the interest
in disclosure against the interest in privacy
and may therefore establish common law
exemptions to the act.462

○○ Custodians must provide public portions

of records after separating them from the
confidential information.463

○○ The act covers electronic records. The
existence of information in electronic
format does not affect its openness.

○○ The Inspection of Public Records Act does

not dictate the fees for providing access to
electronic access to records. Custodians are
authorized to charge a fee, however, and
the practice of establishing fee schedules is
typically done on a case-by-case basis.469

constitutionality of these provisions has
been challenged and at times refuted.

computer printouts of data in order to
“preserve the integrity of the computer
data or the confidentiality of exempt
information.”466

▶▶ Courts have upheld public agencies’

authority to provide electronic records
in a hard copy format.467

Kings County 1995); See Sheehan v. City of Syracuse,
521 N.Y.S.2d 207 (1987).
Enacted in 1974, New York’s first Freedom of
Information Law enumerated records that public
agencies were required to make available to the
public and created the Committee on Public Access
to Records (now known as the Committee on Open
Government) designed to promulgate rules and
regulations regarding open records. The statute
was repealed and reenacted in 1977 with significant
changes. The new law created a presumption of
openness. Rather than listing records agencies must
disclose, the law declared all records open unless
specifically exempt by statute. Other amendments
have served to clarify the act. In 1982, the
legislature added a provision to authorize the courts
to award attorneys’ fees to substantially successful
plaintiffs bringing action against public agencies
for wrongfully denying access to records. Another
revision in 1989 prohibited the destruction of public
records with the intent to prevent disclosure.
• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ The statute does not limit access to records
based on the status of the requester, but
rather states that “the public, individually
and collectively and represented by a free
press, should have access to the records
of government.”471 The law is typically
liberally construed to maximize access to
public records.

471

N.Y. Pub. Off. Law § 84 (McKinney 1988).

○○ The purpose of the request has been

deemed generally immaterial by a wealth of
case law.472
▶▶ Agencies

may, however, withhold
records or delete identifying details from
data to prevent an unwarranted invasion
of privacy. The statute’s definition of an
invasion of personal privacy includes
the “sale or release of lists of names and
addresses if such lists would be used for
commercial or fund-raising purposes.”473

○○ The subsequent use of any public records

received is unrestricted by the act.

• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:
○○ The statute applies to agencies, which
are defined as “any state or municipal
department, board, bureau, division,
commission, committee, public authority,
public corporation, council, office or
other governmental entity performing a
governmental or proprietary function.”474
○○ The

statutory definition includes the
executive branch, while common law tends
to grant access to records of the executives
themselves.475

○○ Judicial decisions have expanded the scope

of the act in ruling that it is “not to be
limited based on the purpose for which the
document was produced or the function to
which it relates.”476

○○ The definition of “agency” found in Section

86 includes local legislative bodies but

88 authorizes the state
legislature to create its own rules
regarding the time, place, and specific
fees (following certain limitations) for
providing access to public records.

• Fees and costs:

for providing public records shall not exceed
either the $0.25 per page smaller than 9” x
14” or the actual cost of copying.483

▶▶ The section also lists 13 categories

○○ The act contains no provisions regarding

of documents which must be made
available to the public, including bills
and resolutions, transcripts of minutes,
external audits, and voting records of
each member.

○○ The term “agency” also excludes the judicial

branch.

▶▶ However, once an agency has obtained

court
documents,
these
records
become open unless the information is
specifically exempt.477

▶▶ Other laws make certain court records

open to the public.478

○○ Nongovernmental

bodies that provide
public services or act on behalf of the
government are subject to the Freedom of
Information Law.479

○○ Lower courts have ruled that records

• Enforcement and sanctions:
○○ Individuals denied access to records may
first appeal to the head of the agency
holding those records within 30 days of
the denial. The agency must then forward
a copy of the appeal to the Committee on
Open Government.
○○ If the appeal is denied, the requester “may

bring a proceeding for review of such denial
pursuant to article seventy-eight of the civil
practice law and rules.”484

○○ If the court determines that the requested

record was of significant interest to
the public and that the agency had no
reasonable basis for refusing disclosure, the
successful plaintiff may recover attorneys’
fees and costs.485

pertaining to interstate bodies are exempt
from disclosure, though the records of
regional bodies are available open under

○○ The statute broadly covers “any information

Ct. (1995)
The Public Records Law of North Carolina dates
back to 1935. The focal purpose of the original law,
however, was to preserve public records, rather than
disclose them. Significant amendments have been
adopted due to pressures from citizens and groups
desiring greater openness from the government. In
1975, for example, the legislature extended the law to
electronic records and other non-traditional formats.
Other, more recent changes open certain criminal
information that was previously confidential,
prohibit custodians from requiring requesters state
their purpose for records, and require agencies to
provide public information found commingled with
confidential material and keep indexes of their
databases.
• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ Under the Public Records Law, “any person”
may request access to public records,
regardless of residence or citizenship.492
○○ The purpose of the request is immaterial.

In fact, custodians are prohibited from
requiring individuals to state their
purpose.493

○○ The subsequent use of records is unrestricted

for most documents. The statute provides

one exception for geographical information
systems, which will be discussed in further
detail.
• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:
○○ The law applies to every “agency of North
Carolina government or its subdivisions”
which includes “every public office, public
officer or official (State or local, elected or
appointed), institution, board, commission,
… or other unit of government of the
State or of any county, unit, special
district or other political subdivision of
government.”494
○○ This definition includes the executive

branch and the executives themselves.

○○ The legislative branch is also covered,

though other provisions apply and may
exclude certain documents from disclosure.

▶▶ For example, one statute authorizes

legislators to preserve the confidentiality
of requests to staff members for
information or assistance in drafting.495

▶▶ The Attorney General has opined,

however, that communication between
legislators and their constituents is
public information.

○○ Court records are also covered in the act,

though other statutes also apply.496

○○ The receipt of public funds does not

necessarily subject the recipient to the
Public Records Law. Other statutes dictate
reporting requirements for entities which
receive public funding if the funds are
not in exchange for goods or services. For
example,
▶▶ Any grantee which annually receives

between $15,000 and $300,000 of
state funding is required to file a sworn
accounting statement of receipts and

expenditures of those funds within six
months following the end of the fiscal
year during which the grantee received
the funds.

• Fees and costs:
○○ Fees for certification of public records are
provided by statutes generally relating to
the specific record itself.

▶▶ Any grantee which receives, uses, or

○○ Fees for uncertified copies of are limited to

expends more than $300,000 in state
funds annually is required to file an
annual financial statement with the
state auditor.497

▶▶ State auditors may require any nonprofit

corporation or other organization which
receives more than $1,000 in state
funding to submit to an audit, a copy of
which must be filed with the Office of
the State Auditor.

▶▶ Counties and cities which grant $1,000

or more to a nonprofit corporation or
other organization within a fiscal year
may require the organization to have an
audit performed for that year and filed
with the county or city.498

○○ Advisory boards, commissions, and multi-

state or regional bodies are covered if the
records relate to public business.

○○ The records covered by the act include “all

documents, papers, letters, maps, books,
photographs, films, sound recordings,
magnetic or other tapes, electronic
data‑processing records, artifacts, or other
documentary material, regardless of physical
form or characteristics, made or received
pursuant to law or ordinance in connection
with the transaction of public business.”499

○○ This definition has been expanded by the

actual cost of producing that copy. Actual
costs do not include any costs that the
agency would have incurred if no request
had been made, such as overhead costs.

○○ Personnel costs may only be included in a

special service charge if the request requires
the extensive use of labor.

○○ The State Chief Information Officer is

authorized to mediate any disputes should a
requester find unreasonable or unfair fees.501

○○ Agencies are not required to charge fees,

and many do not for routine requests. The
act does not, however, prescribe fee waivers
or reductions explicitly.

• Enforcement and sanctions:
○○ Enforcement occurs through individuals
filing civil suits against agencies in court.
○○ The Attorney General plays a limited

role in enforcement and primarily issues
opinions interpreting the act.

○○ A successful plaintiff may recover attorneys’

fees at the judge’s discretion if the court
finds the agency lacked justification in
denying access to records.

exemptions apply to certain records,
including adoption records, DNA profiles,

others.

○○ Fees for electronic records are assessed in

a similar fashion to other forms. Public
agencies may charge no more than the
actual cost of providing the record.

○○ North Carolina courts have ruled that only

statutory provisions can create exclusions
to the law, not the courts, which only serve
to interpret the act. There are no courtderived exclusions or privileges found in
common law.505

○○ Agencies must provide public portions of

documents containing confidential material
and must bear the costs of redacting that
information.506

electronic records.
▶▶ E-mail is presumably public if its content

relates to public business.

▶▶ If,

however, “extensive use of
information technology resources” is
required to fulfill the request, a special
service charge may be levied.511

• Money-Making:
○○ Public agencies may generally charge no
more than the actual cost of providing
copies of public records. Special service
charges assessed for providing tailored
searches which involve extensive labor or
technological resources still must be based
on actual costs.
○○ The use of public records by private

Chapter 4 of Title 44 of the North Dakota Century
Code contains the state’s Open Records Statute.
Court rulings and opinions of the Attorney General
have interpreted the act so as to allow extensive
access to public records. The presumption of
openness dictates that all records are open unless
closed specifically by statute. Article XI, Section 6
of the North Dakota Constitution also contains a
provision opening government records to the public:
Unless otherwise provided by law, all records of
public or governmental bodies, boards, bureaus,
commissions, or agencies of the state or any
political subdivision of the state, or organizations
or agencies supported in whole or in part by
public funds, or expending public funds, shall
be public records, open and accessible for
inspection during reasonable office hours.
• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ Any person may request access to records
under the Open Records Statute and the
constitutional provision requiring public
records to be open to inspection.

trade secrets may be regulated by other
statutes.513
• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:
○○ The statute applies to all “[p]ublic or
governmental bodies, boards, bureaus,
commissions, or agencies of the state [or
any political subdivision of the state], … or
any task force or working group created by
the individual in charge of a state agency or
institution, to exercise public authority or
perform a governmental function.”514
○○ This definition encompasses all executive

and legislative entities.

○○ While the act does not explicitly cover the

judicial branch, there generally exists a
common law access to court records when
no specific exemption applies.515

○○ The statute explicitly covers organizations,

even private entities, which expend or are
supported by public funding.516

○○ Organizations

which have government
officials as members are not necessarily
subject to the act unless they receive or
expend public funding.

○○ The statute broadly covers all “recorded

information of any kind, regardless of the
physical form or characteristic by which
the information is stored, recorded, or
reproduced, which is in the possession or
custody of a public entity or its agent and
which has been received or prepared for
use in connection with public business or
contains information relating to public
business.”517

○○ The purpose of the request is unimportant.

Requesters need not disclose their purpose
for obtaining the public information.

○○ The subsequent use is largely unrestricted by

the statute. However, if records containing
trade secrets are released, the use of those

○○ The act distinguishes between the concept
▶▶ Confidential records are mandatorily

exempt from disclosure.

▶▶ Closed records may be disclosed at the

discretion of the agency.523

○○ Sections 44-04-18.1 – 44-04-18.21 contain

numerous exemptions. A few include
medical records; lists of minors; examination
questions; proprietary, commercial, and
financial information; and trade secrets.

○○ Many other statutory exemptions exist

throughout the North Dakota Century
Code. A few of these include veterans
discharge documents, grand jury records,
certain reports or records from the
Departments of Transportation, Corrections
and Rehabilitation, and Human Services.524

○○ The court has no authority to create

common law exemptions. The North
Dakota Supreme Court ruled that only

○○ The requester may choose to receive copies

of public records in either electronic print
format, or other available medium.529

○○ Public entities may not deny access to

records on the grounds that they contain
confidential or closed information. Rather,
custodians must delete or otherwise
withhold confidential portions and release
the public information.526

• Electronic Records:
○○ Electronic records are covered under the
Open Records Statute which applies to all
public records regardless of format.
▶▶ The statue does not expressly address

the content of e-mails, though it
does prohibit the disclosure of e-mail
addresses.

○○ Public agencies are not required to compile

or create records which do not already exist.
▶▶ However, if they choose to do so, as

mentioned, agencies may charge up to
$25.00 for each hour of labor past the
first hour devoted to providing a copy of
the record requested.

• Money-Making:
○○ Public agencies, except where otherwise
prescribed by law, may charge no more than
the actual cost of providing public records.
○○ The only limitation of use for private

individuals is a prohibition against
disclosing confidential material. The
Open Records Statute does not restrict
commercial use of public information.

▶▶ Software is exempt from disclosure.527
○○ The statute stipulates that access to

electronic records should be free if the
information can be recovered without using
a computer backup.

The preservation of public records in Ohio
predates statehood. Common law access to public
information was first officially recognized in 1901.530
The state legislature codified the Open Records
Law in 1963 within Chapter 143 of Title 1, which
embodies the original intent to provide the public
with access to information regarding the activities of
government. Subsequent revisions and amendments
have expanded the reaches of the statute since its
enactment.
• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ The Open Records Law enables “any
person” to inspect or copy public records,
regardless of state or country citizenship
status.531
▶▶ Courts have broadly interpreted the

term “any person” to permit “anyone,
including any recognized business entity
(defendants, newspapers, researchers,
designees and/or nondesignees) to
obtain records.”532

106 • National Association of Counties

▶▶ However, the statute requires inmates

to receive consent from a judge to gain
access to records regarding criminal
investigations or prosecutions.533

○○ The purpose of the request will not affect

access to records but may have some bearing
on costs or other factors regarding records.
▶▶ Public offices are authorized to limit the

number of copies requesters receive via
U.S. mail to ten per month unless the
requester states that the records or the
information they contain will not be
used for commercial purposes.534

▶▶ The bureau of motor vehicles may

charge extra fees for “bulk commercial
special extraction requests.”535

○○ The statute does not restrict the subsequent

use of public records obtained.

• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:
○○ The act defines “public record” as any
“records kept by any public office,
including, but not limited to, state, county,
city, village, township, and school district
units, and records pertaining to the delivery
of educational services by an alternative
school in this state kept by the nonprofit or
for-profit entity…”536
○○ The definition of “public office” is equally

broad and encompasses every “entity
established by the laws of this state for the
exercise of any function of government.”537

○○ This definition covers the executive branch

as well as the executives themselves, without
distinguishing among records pertaining to
different functions of the executive offices.

the constitution may prevent the statute
from being applied to the Governor and
Lieutenant Governor, Secretary of State,
State Treasurer, State Auditor, and
Attorney General. The same doctrine
does holds for local chief executives,
including mayors.538
○○ The statute also covers legislative bodies.

The Supreme Court has not yet ruled
regarding the application of the statute
to the state’s General Assembly. The
separation of powers doctrine may also
preclude the statute’s application to various
internal records of the state legislators.539

○○ The Supreme Court has applied the Open

Records Law to court records.540

○○ Nongovernmental entities are also subject

to the act.

▶▶ All records “pertaining to the delivery

of educational services by an alternative
school in this state kept by the nonprofit
or for-profit entity operating the
alternative school” are public.541

▶▶ The records of private entities charged

with performing public functions by
public agencies have been held subject
to the statute by the Ohio Supreme
Court.542 The openness of the records
basically depends on their relation to
public business.

○○ The state legislature expanded the types of

records covered by the act from those which
public agencies were required to keep to all
those possessed by the agency.

○○ Records do not lose their public status after

being transferred to a private party.543

○○ The physical format of the record does not

affect whether or not it may be disclosed.

○○ All records available for inspection may be

reproduced for the public.

• Fees and costs:
○○ The statute authorizes agencies to provide
copies “at cost.”544
○○ The fees charged for reproductions of public

records has been ruled as limited to the
direct costs of supplies used to provide the
copies request, excluding labor costs.545
▶▶ The only exception is for special requests

from the department of motor vehicles
which will be discussed further.

○○ Public agencies may not charge individuals

for inspecting records, even if information
must first be redacted.

○○ The statute makes no provisions for fee

waivers, and case law has yet to address this
issue.

• Enforcement and sanctions:
○○ Individuals denied access to records may
bring a mandamus action in court.
○○ Courts may award attorneys’ fees and costs

to successful plaintiffs.

○○ In addition, courts may award damages

of $100 for each day after the action was
filed that the records were withheld, not
exceeding $1,000.546

• Exemptions:
○○ All records are open unless deemed
confidential by a specific statute.
○○ The

language of the law creates
discretionary exceptions. Custodians are
not required to disclose certain records but
are not forbidden from doing so either.

○○ Several exemptions are found throughout

exceptions exist throughout the state

○○ Though the law does not explicitly address

the issue, courts have ruled that custodians
must provide the public information found
among confidential data.552

○○ The Open Records Law explicitly covers
records in electronic form.

agency, that burden may be passed to the

authorized to profit from the sale of public
records is the Bureau of Motor Vehicles.
The agency may charge for the labor costs
associated with creating programs to comply
with special requests made for commercial
purposes in addition to the material costs

• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ Any person, regardless of citizenship status,
may request access to public records.

For more than four decades, Oklahoma’s Open
Records Act remained one paragraph in Chapter 24
of Title 51:

commercial purposes may be charged an
additional fee.

It is hereby made the duty of every public
official of the State of Oklahoma, and of its
subdivisions, who are required by law to keep
public records pertaining to their said offices,
to keep the same open for public inspection
for proper purposes, at proper times and in
proper manner, to the citizens and taxpayers
of the State, and its subdivisions, during all
business hours of the day; provided, however,
the provisions of this Act shall not apply to
income tax returns filed with the Oklahoma
Tax Commission, or other records required by
law to be kept secret.
Since then, it has been expanded and amended.
Concerns regarding individuals’ right to privacy
arose in several court cases. Though the Ohio
Supreme Court sought to balance individuals’
privacy interests with the public’s interest in
disclosure, the state legislature insisted that the
specific exceptions to the act would sufficiently
protect individuals’ interests and amended the act to
state:
The Oklahoma Open Records Act shall not
create, directly or indirectly, any rights of
privacy or any remedies for violation of any
rights of privacy; nor shall the Oklahoma
Open Records Act, except as specifically set
forth in the Oklahoma Open Records Act,
establish any procedures for protecting any
person from release of information contained
in public records. The purpose of this act is to
ensure and facilitate the public’s right of access
to and review of government records so they

does not affect the individuals’ access to
records.
▶▶ However, those seeking records for

○○ The Open Records Act does not restrict the

subsequent use of public information.

• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:
○○ The statute applies to public bodies, which
are defined as “any office, department,
board, bureau, commission, agency, … or
any entity created by a trust, county, city,
village, town, … court, executive office,
advisory group, … or any subdivision
thereof, supported in whole or in part
by public funds or entrusted with the
expenditure of public funds or administering
or operating public property…”559
○○ This definition includes executive agencies

and the executives themselves.

○○ The act does not encompass the state

legislature or legislators unless the records
relate to the receipt or expenditure of public
funding.

○○ The act does cover court records but

excludes the records of judges or justices
unless the information relates to the receipt
or expenditure of public funding.560

○○ Entities which receive public funding are

subject to the act.

○○ All

other entities involved in the
transaction of public business may be held
subject to the Open Records Act.

○○ The statute broadly defines public records

as “all documents… received by, under the
authority of, or coming into the custody,
control or possession of public officials,
public bodies, or their representatives in
connection with the transaction of public
business, the expenditure of public funds or
the administering of public property.”561

○○ The physical format of the record is

irrelevant.

○○ All records available for inspection are

available for copying.

• Fees and costs:
○○ Public agencies are authorized to charge
only “reasonable, direct costs of record
copying” not exceeding 25 cents per page
or $1.00 per page for certified copies unless
otherwise prescribed by law.
○○ Agencies may charge for the cost of searching

and copying under two circumstances:

1. The request is for commercial purposes, or
2. Fulfilling the request would create
“excessive disruption of the essential
functions of the public body.”562
▶▶ Note that publication or broadcast for

news purposes does not constitute a
commercial purpose.

○○ Section 24A.5.3 states, “In no case shall a

search fee be charged when the release of
records is in the public interest, including,
but not limited to, release to the news media,
scholars, authors and taxpayers seeking to
determine whether those entrusted with
the affairs of the government are honestly,
faithfully, and competently performing
their duties as public servants.”

○○ The statute also demands that fees not be

used to discourage requests.

• Enforcement and sanctions:
○○ Those denied access to records may bring a
civil suit to seek injunctive relief.
○○ If

successful, plaintiffs may

○○ Any public official found guilty of a willful

violation of the act will be guilty of a

exceeding $500 and/or imprisonment in a
county jail up to 1 year.565

○○ Attorneys General may provide opinions

interpreting the Open Records Act but

exemptions
throughout
sections 24A.7 through 24A.29.

General, public bodies may not

paper records, limited to reasonable direct

• Money-Making:

the sale of public records, as they are not
allowed to charge personnel costs related to
searching for documents unless the request
is burdensome or for commercial purposes.
○○ The Open Records Act clearly acknowledges

that requests may be made for commercial
purposes, though these requesters may face
greater charges to obtain the information.

Public Records Law
Codes: ORS 192.410 – 192.595
Relevant Court Cases: McEwan v. Holm, 226 Or.
27, 359 P.2d 413 (1961); Jordan v. MVD, 308 Or 433,
781 P2d 1203 (1989); Coos County v. Department of

Oregon, Dept. of Administrative Services, 150 Or.
App. 87, 945 P.2d 102 (1997)
Oregon adopted the Public Records Law in 1973.
The State Department of Justice plays a focal role
in interpreting the statute. Every two years the
Attorney General publishes a Public Records and
Meetings Manual, which may serve as a useful
reference tool. The manual reviews the requirements
for open records and contains an index and
summary of relevant opinions from the Attorney
General. This manual is available for purchase from
the Oregon Department of Justice.
• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ Any person, regardless of residency or
citizenship status may request access to
public records.577 ORS 192.410 defines the
term “person” as including “any natural
person, corporation, partnership, firm,
association or member or committee of the
Legislative Assembly.”
▶▶ A person’s identity may be relevant

when seeking access to a record subject
to an exception that requires a person to
show interest in disclosure.

○○ The purpose of a request is generally

immaterial.578

▶▶ Purpose may only be taken into account

when an individual is seeking access to
records which fall under exemptions to
the act.

○○ The

subsequent use of any public
information obtained is unrestricted.

112 • National Association of Counties

• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:
○○ The Public Records Law applies to every
“public body” including “every state officer,
agency, department, division, bureau, board
and commission; every county and city
governing body, school district, special
district, municipal corporation, and any
board, department, commission, council or
agency thereof, and any other public agency
of the state.”579
▶▶ ORS 192.410(5) defines “state agency”

as “any state officer, department, board,
commission or court created by the
Constitution or statutes of this state.”

▶▶ “Public corporations,” including the

state health and sciences university,
the state bar organization, and a state
accident insurance company, have been
held subject to the statute.

▶▶ The Oregon Supreme Court has ruled

that any entity which is the “functional
equivalent” of a public agency, the act
applies to it.

○○ The executive branch and its officers are

subject to the act.

○○ Records of legislative entities excluding

the state legislature are covered under the
act. The state Legislative Assembly is not
subject to the Public Records Law.580

○○ The courts are subject to Article I, § 10, of

the Oregon Constitution, which requires
openness. Whether the judicial branch is
subject to the Public Records Law, however,
remains unclear.581

○○ The receipt of public funding or having

public officials as members are, alone,
insufficient to subject that entity to the
statute. The court established a six part
test in Marks v. McKenzie High School Fact

resolutions or merely recommendations
4. The level and nature of public financial
and nonfinancial support;
5. The extent of governmental control
over the entity’s operations; and
6. Whether the entity’s staff or officers are
public employees.582

◈◈ Agencies may not include the cost of

determining the applicability of the
provisions of the Public Records Law.

○○ The Attorney General has opined that

public agencies may charge individuals for
searches even if the requested records are
not found.

○○ Public bodies must provide an estimate if

the fee will likely exceed $25.00.

○○ Under ORS 192.440(5), public bodies

may provide a fee waiver or reduction if
disclosure “primarily benefits the general
public.”
▶▶ The Attorney General has decided that

○○ The language applying the statute to every

public agency in the state makes it unclear
if multi-state or regional bodies are subject
to its provisions.

if public bodies whose funding comes
from statutorily or constitutionally
dedicated sources, they may not provide
fee waivers or reductions and should
charge the actual costs of providing
access to public records.

○○ The statute defines public records as “any

▶▶ Section 192.440(6) offers an appeals

writing that contains information relating
to the conduct of the public’s business …
prepared, owned, used or retained by a
public body.”583

○○ All public records are available, regardless

of physical format or characteristics.

○○ All records available for inspection may

also be copied.

584

• Fees and costs:
○○ Agencies are authorized to charge a fee
“reasonably calculated to reimburse” that
agency for the actual cost of providing
access to or copies of public records. These
costs may include the following elements:585
▶▶ Costs of compiling, summarizing, or

tailoring records to fulfill the request;

▶▶ Cost of the time an attorney spends

reviewing the records and redacting
confidential material from the public
portions.

process for wrongful denials of fee
waivers. Individuals may petition the
Attorney General or district attorney.

▶▶ State courts also have jurisdiction to

review the reasonableness of fees.586

○○ Agencies may require advance payment

of estimated fees prior to compiling and
providing records. Custodians must refund
requesters any excess costs provided if
actual charges are less than the original
estimate.

• Enforcement and sanctions:
○○ Those denied access to public records may
petition the Attorney General to determine
the openness of the record. The Attorney
General must grant or deny the petition
within seven days and has the authority
to order the state agency to disclose the
requested record.587
▶▶ If the Attorney General grants the

petition and orders disclosure, a
state agency may seek injunctive or
declaratory relief in civil court within
seven days of receiving the order.

▶▶ If the Attorney General denies the

petition or allows the state agency to
withhold records, the individual may
then institute proceedings in civil court
to receive injunctive or declaratory
relief. In this case, the Attorney General
will serve as the state agency’s counsel.
◈◈ Note that separate procedures may

exist for those seeking records from
different agencies.588

○○ These proceedings take precedence on the

docket and must be expedited in court.589

○○ Courts have the authority to enjoin the

public agency from withholding the
requested information if it finds that it
wrongfully denied access. The court may
first view the materials in question prior to
reaching a decision.590

○○ Prevailing

plaintiffs may be awarded
attorneys’ fees at the court’s discretion. The
petitioner may also receive litigation costs
if the agency failed to institute proceedings
within seven days or if it failed to comply
with the Attorney General’s order,
regardless of the outcome of the case.591

○○ Section 192.541 outlines sanctions for

violations of Sections 192.535, 192.537,
192.539 or 192.547, which primarily pertain
to the disclosure of records containing
genetic information.

unless disclosure would serve the public
interest.
▶▶ A few of these include trade secrets,

investigatory information, personnel

information.

○○ Section

192.502 contains another 37
categories which are exempt from disclosure.
▶▶ Examples include personal information,

library records, and several other specific
records which relate to or are possessed
by specific public agencies.

○○ The statute also provides exemptions to

all other exceptions to disclosure found
in federal laws or throughout the state
code.593 The Attorney General Manual also
provides a list of statutes relevant to open
records.
▶▶ Certain records exempt by other state

or federal laws include medical records,
private financial records, and educator
personnel files.

○○ Courts do have the authority to establish

common law exemptions.

Dep’t of Transp., 664 A.2d 208, 213 (Pa. Commw. Ct.

Michel, 633 A.2d 1233, 1239 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 1993),
appeal denied, 645 A.2d 1321 (Pa. 1994)
Note that these cases serve to interpret the prior act.
Pennsylvania’s first Open Records Law, often referred
to as the “Right to Know” Act, was originally
adopted in 1957. In January 2008, the state legislature
enacted a new Right to Know Law. Though certain
provisions are entirely new, the Right to Know Law
maintains some procedures from amendments made
in 2002. One of the more significant changes is the
new presumption of openness that requires state and
local agencies to provide access to records unless the
government agency is able to demonstrate that the
requested records are not public records. The act
contains a broader definition of what constitutes a
record but provides a longer list of exceptions. Also,
the new act applies to certain entities the prior
act did not, including the General Assembly and
state-related institutions, such as public universities
and government contractors. Agencies now have
fewer days to respond to requests and are liable for
stricter civil penalties. The new Right to Know Law
establishes the Office of Open Records which is
charged with handling appeals, mitigating disputes,
issuing opinions, and spreading information.
• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ The act defines a “requester” as a “person
that is a legal resident of the United States
and requests a record pursuant to this act.
The term includes an agency.”596 Illegal
aliens and foreign visitors therefore have no
access to public records.
○○ Consistent with prior case law, no public

agency may deny a request for records

596

Section 102.

116 • National Association of Counties

because of the requester’s intended use of
the information.597
○○ The statute does not explicitly restrict the

subsequent use of information obtained, and
case law has provided no restrictions either.598

• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:
○○ The statute defines several categories of
public entities which are subject to its
provisions in Section 102:
▶▶ Commonwealth

agencies
include
all offices, departments, boards, or
commissions pertaining to the executive
branch; all independent agencies; and
all state-affiliated entities. This term
also includes the offices of the Governor
and Attorney General, the Treasury
Department, and the Department
of the Auditor General, along with
any other organization which was
established by a statute, executive order,
or the state constitution and performs a
governmental function.
◈◈ Independent agencies are boards,

commissions, or other agencies which
are outside the policy supervision of
the Governor.

◈◈ The

statute includes a list of
boards and commissions which are
considered “state-affiliated agencies,”
including the Pennsylvania Higher
Education Assistance Agency, the
Pennsylvania
Gaming
Control
Board, the Pennsylvania Fish and
Boat Commission, the Pennsylvania
Housing Finance Agency, and the
State System of Higher Education.

◈◈ Local agencies include all political

subdivisions and intermediate units;
charter, cyber charter, vocational,
or trade schools; along with any
“local, intergovernmental, regional

or municipal agency, authority,
council, board, commission or similar
governmental entity.”

fiscal notes, the journal and rules of a
chamber, and other types of reports and
manuals.

▶▶ The statute defines “legislative agencies”

▶▶ Financial records, as defined in Section

with a list of 15 entities, including the
Senate, the House of Representatives, the
Joint State Government Commission,
and several other legislative commissions
and committees.
◈◈ The previous act did not apply to the

legislative branch.599

▶▶ Judicial agencies include all courts and

offices of the judicial branch.

○○ These definitions encompass all three

branches of all levels of government.

○○ The receipt of public funding or having

public officials as members of the
organization is not sufficient to deem an
entity a public agency subject to the act,
though most of these organizations appear
to fall within one of the categories the act
does cover.600

○○ Multi-state bodies are included in the

definition of commonwealth agencies and
are therefore subject to the act’s provisions.

○○ Agencies or commissions which function

purely to serve as advisory boards were
not included in the interpretations of
the previous act, as they did not serve an
“essential” function.601

○○ Local and commonwealth agencies must

provide “public records,” while legislative
agencies provide “legislative records” and
judicial agencies provide “financial records.”602
▶▶ Public records, as defined in Section

102, include all records which are not
protected under a privilege or exempt by
Section 708 or other state or federal laws.

▶▶ Section 102 provides a list of 19 types of

records which are considered “legislative
records,” including financial records,

102, include all accounts, vouchers,
or contracts regarding the receipt or
expenditure of funds or an agency’s
obtainment or use of services, materials,
or property. The definition also includes
final financial audit reports and the
salaries of public officials.

○○ The term “record” encompasses all physical

formats of information.

○○ All records are available for inspection and

duplication.

• Fees and costs:
○○ Section 1307 divides the fees that may be
charged for reproduction of paper records
into three components:
1. Postage: Fees should not exceed the
actual cost of mailing records.
2. Duplication: Fess for local and
commonwealth agencies are established
by the Office of Open Records.
Legislative and judicial agencies establish
their own fee practices. Fees must be
“reasonable and based on prevailing
fees for comparable duplication services
provided by local business entities.”
◈◈ For

extensive or complex data
sets, agencies may base fees on the
fair market value of comparable
information, unless the requester is
a nonprofit organization conducting
research or is connected to the news
media with the intent to publish or
broadcast the information.

3. Certification: Agencies are authorized
to charge a fee for certifying copies of
public records.
○○ Agencies may not impose fees for reviewing

the record to determine whether it is subject
to disclosure.

○○ Agencies may waive fees if the requester

duplicates the record using his/her own
resources or if the custodian believes a
waiver would serve the public interest.

▶▶ Regarding law enforcement records and

statewide officials, the Attorney General,
State Treasurer and Auditor General must
each designate an appeals officer. Also,
the district attorney for each county must
designate one or more appeals officers to
hear any appeals concerning criminal
investigative records held by a local agency
of the county. The appointed officer has
the authority to decide whether or not the
requested record constitutes a criminal
investigative record.

• Exemptions:
○○ Section 708 of the Right to Know Law
provides 30 categories of records which are
exempt from disclosure.
○○ A few of the specific exceptions include

medium.619

○○ Many other statutes throughout the state

code exempt records from or require
disclosure. A few exempt categories include
adoption records, child abuse reports, and
insurance information. Others may be
found as they relate to specific industries or
occupations in their respective portions of
the state code.615

○○ Agencies may charge additional fees in the

form of a subscription fee, a flat rate, or a pertransaction charge for providing enhanced
electronic access. Providing enhanced
access does not permit agencies to cease
providing access to records in accordance
with the statute’s other provisions. The
Office of Open Records must approve these
fees, which may not be designed to hinder
access to records or generate a profit for the
agency.620

○○ The act explicitly does not supersede

judicial orders or decrees. The courts appear
to have the authority to derive common law
exceptions.

of otherwise exempt materials.616

Drug Abuse, 417 S.E.2d 870 (S.C. 1992)
South Carolina enacted the state’s first Freedom of
Information Act in 1974. Subsequent Supreme Court
cases led to significant revisions in 1978. Further
amendments broadened the act and limited public
agencies’ authority to adopt their own exemptions
to the act. The current Chief Justice of the South
Carolina Supreme Court Jean Hoefer Toal authored
the 1978 act and sponsored the 1987 revisions while
she was a member of the state legislature. Found in
Chapter 4 of Title 30 of the South Carolina Code of
Laws, the Freedom of Information Act grants access
to all records not closed by specific statutes.
• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ “Any person,” including individuals,
corporations,
firms,
partnerships,
associations and other organizations, has
the right to request access to public records
in South Carolina under the state’s Freedom
of Information Act.621
○○ Where the use of information is restricted,

an individual’s intended purpose may
become relevant.

▶▶ Requesters seeking records regarding

the registration and licensing of motor
vehicles are required to state the purpose
of the request.622

▶▶ Under the Freedom of Information

Act, personal information, including
the names, addresses and telephone
numbers of handicapped or disabled
persons should not be disclosed “when
the information is requested for personto-person commercial solicitation of
handicapped persons solely by virtue of
their handicap.”625

▶▶ Other information which Section 30-

4-50(B) prohibits from being used for
commercial purposes include:
◈◈ Information contained in police inci-

dent reports;

◈◈ Employee salary schedules;
◈◈ Home addresses and telephone num-

bers of public employees.

• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:
○○ The act applies to all “public bodies” defined
as “any department of the State, … any state
board, commission, agency, and authority,
any public or governmental body or
political subdivision of the State, including
counties, municipalities, townships, school
districts, and special purpose districts, or
any organization, corporation, or agency
supported in whole or in part by public
funds or expending public funds, … any
quasi-governmental body of the State and
its political subdivisions…”626

lowest attainable actual cost of searching
for and reproducing public records.
○○ Agencies may not charge for the time spent

determining if the information is public or
confidential.

disclosure would serve the general public.

○○ The Attorney General issues opinions

interpreting the law but has no prescribed
role in enforcing its provisions.

▶▶ Software remains unaddressed within

the statute.

○○ Public agencies must provide requesters

with a format which is “convenient and
practical for use” if “it is equally convenient
for the public body to provide the records in

○○ As the act does not supersede any other

statutes exempting records from disclosure,
many such provisions exist throughout
the state code.636 A few of these types of
records include income tax information,
reports of child abuse, and birth and death
certificates.

○○ Agencies may provide custom searches

required to do so. Custodians may charge
for these services, including the cost of
writing a computer program for the search.

subdivision, or tax-supported district in this
state, or any agency, branch, department,
board, bureau, commission, council, subunit,
or committee of any of the foregoing,” except
those exempted by statute.642

Codes: S.D.C.L. § 1-27-1 – 1-27-46
Relevant Court Cases: The South Dakota Supreme
Court has had no opportunity to address issues
regarding access to open records. Case law has
provided no precedents or guidance to follow.

○○ This expansive definition encompasses the

executive branch and its employees.

The Sunshine Law of South Dakota opens
governmental records to the public and creates
a presumption of openness while allowing state
agencies and local entities to promulgate their own
rules regarding practices and fees for providing
copies of public records. Largely similar to the
original statute enacted in 1935, the Sunshine Law is
found in Chapter 27 of Title 1 of the South Dakota
Codified Laws.

○○ The legislature is also not excluded.
○○ The courts have not been excluded from

the act; however, in 2004, the Supreme
Court adopted its own set of rules regarding
court records, which are now codified at
S.D.C.L. § 15-15A.

○○ Entities which receive or expend public

funding are not expressly covered in the
statute and likely fall outside its scope.

• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ Section 1-27-1 of the Sunshine Law
empowers any person “interested in the
examination of the public records” to
request access.

○○ Similarly, bodies whose members include

public officials are not necessarily subject to
the act.

○○ Multi-state

or regional bodies may
be covered indirectly if they act as a
governmental entity.

▶▶ Inmates may not have full access to

records which other individuals may
request. Section 1-27-1.13 authorizes
the secretary of corrections to “prohibit
the release of information to inmates
or their agents regarding correctional
operations, department policies and
procedures, and inmate records of the
requesting inmate or other inmates if
the release would jeopardize the safety
or security of a person, the operation of a
correctional facility, or the safety of the
public.”

○○ The purpose of the request is generally

irrelevant under the statute.

▶▶ However, the act specifically bans the

resale or redistribution of information
obtained under its provisions, as will be
detailed in the final section.

• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:
○○ The statute covers all “records and documents,
regardless of physical form, of or belonging to
this state, any county, municipality, political

○○ Other advisory boards and commissions

may fall within the purview of the act to
the extent that such entities serve as public
offices.643

○○ The definition of public records includes all

materials regardless of physical format or
characteristics.

○○ Records are open for inspection and copying

during normal business hours.644

• Fees and costs:
○○ Other than authorizing “reasonable” fees
for lists of the Department of Game, Fish
and Parks and special service fees (discussed
further in the section regarding electronic
records), the statute does not stipulate a
schedule of fees.

authority to discharge the guilty officer but
refuses to do so will be guilty of a Class 2
misdemeanor.

○○ Custodians may waive or reduce fees at

their discretion if doing so would serve the
public interest.

• Enforcement and sanctions:
○○ Sections 1-27-38 through 1-27-41 outlines
the procedures for those who wish to
contest a denial to access to public records
or an estimate of costs or time required to
produce a record.
▶▶ A person may instigate a civil action

or seek an administrative review by
filing a written notice with the Office
of Hearing Examiners within 90 days
of receiving a response from the public
agency regarding the original request.

○○ However, public access is generally resolved

through negotiations with the public agency
which possesses the record or is decided by
lower-level circuit courts, which provide
little precedent on which to rely.

• Exemptions:
○○ The Sunshine Law contains several
specific and a couple general exemptions,
which have generally been interpreted as
mandatory, rather than discretionary.
○○ Section 1-27-1.5 lists 27 categories of records

which are not subject to disclosure.

▶▶ The public agency has 10 business days

to respond.

▶▶ A few specific ones include trade secrets,

or safety of any persons.”650

then issue a decision, which may be
appealed in circuit court.

standard, though the act allows additional
fees for specialized services. Custodians
may charge a fee including the cost of
equipment, software, and a portion of
amortization costs associated with the
computer equipment for transmitting a
copy of a public record from one modem to
an outside modem.652

▶▶ A few include tax return information,

public library records, certain crime
victims records, and adoption records.

○○ Section 1-27-10 authorizes custodians to

redact portions of records containing
“information precluded from public
disclosure by § 1-27-3 or which would
unreasonably invade personal privacy,
threaten public safety and security, disclose
proprietary information, or disrupt normal
government operations.”

• Money-Making:
○○ The statute does not explicitly forbid public
agencies from generating revenues from the
sale of public records, though costs must be
“reasonable.”

• Electronic Records:
○○ Electronic records are not exempt from the
act and are presumably covered in the same
manner as other forms of public records.

1-27-1.11 specifically forbids

Ct. App. Dec. 31, 1991)
Tennessee’s Open Records Act, originally enacted
in 1957, opens government records to citizens of
Tennessee. Found in Chapter 7 of Title 10, the act
directs the courts to construe the act “so as to give
the fullest possible public access to public records.”653
In 2008, the state legislature modified the act and
established the Office of Open Records Counsel.
This office is charged with establishing policy
guidelines and fee schedules for custodians of public
records.654
• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ Public records are open to any citizen of the
state of Tennessee.655
▶▶ Other entities may seek access to public

records, as case law has specifically
extended this term to include
corporations.656

○○ The intended purpose of the request is

irrelevant.

○○ The subsequent use of public information is

unrestricted.

126 • National Association of Counties

• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:
○○ The act covers all “governmental agencies”
and does not exempt any branch in its
entirety.
○○ While executive agencies are covered,

Section 8-3-104(10) exempts “papers relating
immediately to the executive department,
and, in the governor’s judgment, requiring
secrecy.”

○○ The legislative branch is not exempt from

the act but does retain the authority to
prevent or permit access to a legislative
computer system which stores confidential
information.657

○○ The judicial branch is covered, though

certain specific records are exempt from
disclosure by other statutes within the state
code and provisions found in procedural
rules associated with the courts.
▶▶ The Supreme Court ruled that any

provisions relating to the disclosure or
confidentiality of court records in the
Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure
supersede the Open Records Act.658

○○ Courts have interpreted the act as cover-

ing nongovernmental bodies which receive
public funds, advisory boards and commissions, and quasi-governmental bodies.

○○ The Tennessee Supreme Court established

a “functional equivalency test” to determine
whether the act would apply to the private
entity in question.659 Three relevant factors
include:
1. The level of government funding;
2. The extent to which the government is
involved or retains control;
3. Whether the government created the
entity.

○○ The act does not explicitly cover multi-state

or regional bodies, though the records of
these entities may be subject to disclosure
if retained by a public agency of the state.

○○ The terms “public records” or “state re-

cords” include “all documents, papers, letters, maps, books, photographs, microfilms,
electronic data processing files and output,
… or other material … made or received
pursuant to law or ordinance or in connection with the transaction of official business
by any governmental agency.”660

○○ The act covers all records, regardless of

their physical characteristics.

○○ All records available for inspection are also

available for copying.

• Fees and costs:
○○ Custodians may charge requesters a fee to
cover the “reasonable costs incurred” in
fulfilling the request.
▶▶ County records commissions has the

authority to establish fees.662

○○ The act contains no provisions regarding

fee waivers.

• Enforcement and sanctions:

○○ The court may order the release or reaffirm

the confidentiality of the records in question.

○○ If the court finds the public official acted in

willful violation of the Open Records Act,
it may award the successful plaintiff costs of

In the years following Texas’s independence from
Mexico and subsequent union with the U.S., the
state’s courts established a common law right
to access public records. One ruling stated that
“[Texas’s] policy has been found to be that all
information kept by the government is of legitimate
public concern unless the legislature rules that the
need for confidentiality is outweighed by the public’s
right to know.”675 Nonetheless, no open records
statute was codified until 1973 after the conviction
of several government officials in the Sharpstown
scandal. Amendments in 1995 renamed the statute
previously known as the Open Records Act to
the Public Information Act and incorporated new
provisions for electronic records. Ten years later,
the legislature passed a bill which requires many
public officials to participate in a training course
concerning the Public Information Act. In 2005, the
legislature passed a bill requiring most elected and
appointed public officials to take training courses on
the Texas Public Information Act.676 The act also
established an Open Records Steering Committee
which conducts studies and advises the Attorney
General regarding open records practices.677

677 Tex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 552.009.

• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ The Public Information Act places no
restriction on who may request access to
records and states that “each person is
entitled … to complete information about
the affairs of government.”678
▶▶ However, governmental agencies are not

required to comply with requests from
incarcerated individuals.679

▶▶ Persons of interest have greater access

to records containing their own private
information under Section 552.023.

○○ The purpose for which the records is

requested is immaterial.

○○ The subsequent use of information obtained

under the act is unrestricted.

• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:
○○ The act defines “public information” as all
information “that is collected, assembled, or
maintained under a law or ordinance or in
connection with the transaction of official
business” by or for a governmental entity. 680
○○ The statute defines a governmental body

broadly with 12 categories of entities subject to
the acts provisions in Section 552.003(1)(A).

○○ The definition includes both the executive

and legislative branches along with all
agencies, committees, departments or
other subunits created by the executive or
legislative branches.

○○ A few exemptions, however, relate to

certain executive and legislative functions.
▶▶ The

statute
provides
for
the
confidentiality of working papers or
drafts from the governor’s office or of
the legislature which relate to proposed
legislation.681

officials is also protected if the release
of such would constitute an invasion of
privacy.682

○○ In general, fees “may not exceed the actual

cost of producing the information or for
making public information that exists in a
paper record available for inspection.”686

▶▶ Inter-agency and intra-agency memoran-

da or letters which would not be available to a party of litigation within that
agency are exempt from disclosure.683

○○ Costs may include supplies, labor, and

overhead components if the request exceeds
50 pages.

○○ The judiciary is specifically excluded from

the definition of governmental bodies.
Open records practices are adopted by
the Supreme Court of Texas rather than
dictated by the Public Information Act.

○○ If an individual requests 50 or fewer pages,

he/she may only be charged a flat rate for
each page, unless the records are located
in two separate buildings or in a remote
storage facility.687

○○ The term “governmental body” also includes

non-governmental entities and quasi-governmental entities, including “the part, section, or portion of an organization, corporation, commission, committee, institution, or
agency that spends or that is supported in
whole or in part by public funds.”684

○○ Section 552.2615 requires public agencies to

provide requesters with an itemized list of
costs if the charges exceed $40.

○○ Public

agencies may require advance
payment of fees under certain circumstances
outlined in Section 552.263.

○○ Additionally, section 552.0037 states that

information collected, or maintained
by a non-governmental entity which is
authorized to exercise eminent domain
is subject to the Public Information Act
insofar as the records requested relate to the
taking of private property.

○○ The statute allows for three circumstances

○○ The form and physical characteristics of the

costs of collecting the fee exceed the

which would merit a waiver or reduction of
fees:
1. Custodians may waive or reduce fees if
providing a copy of the requested records
would benefit the general public.688

“public information” is irrelevant, as the act
has been construed to cover all conceivable
forms of information storage.

3. Section 552.264 entitles members,
committees, or agencies of the legislature
to one free copy of public records.

○○ The act does not distinguish between which

records are open for inspection and which
are available for copying.

• Fees and costs:
○○ The Public Information Act establishes
limits on fees but authorizes the Attorney
General to adopt rules for all state agencies
subject to the act.

• Enforcement and sanctions:
○○ The Public Information Act details
procedures for civil enforcement in
Subchapter H.
○○ Any individual denied access to records

litigation if the public agency was not acting
in accordance with the Public Information
Act, a court order or published opinion, or a
decision of the Attorney General.691
▶▶ A successful defendant or plaintiff in a

suit brought by a government body may
also recover litigation costs.692

○○ The statute also provides for criminal sanc-

tions for certain violations in Subchapter I.

▶▶ The willful destruction, mutilation, or

removal of public records is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine between
$25 and $4,000, imprisonment for a time
span between 3 days and 3 months, or
both.693

tial information is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not exceeding $1,000,
imprisonment for up to 6 months, or
both.694

▶▶ Any public officer who refuses to grant

access to public records with criminal
negligence is guilty of a misdemeanor
punishable by a fine not exceeding
$1,000, imprisonment for up to 6
months, or both.695

• Exemptions:
○○ Several sections throughout Subchapter B
of the statute require the disclosure of many
categories of records,696 while other sections
of Subchapter C contain exceptions and
either mandate or permit custodians to keep
specific categories of records confidential.

○○ Examples of categories of exempt records

include trade secrets, law enforcement
records, certain inter- or intra-agency
memoranda, and student records.

○○ Provisions

in the Public Information
Act exempt all other records deemed
confidential by constitutional, federal, or
state law, or by judicial orders.697

○○ Common

law also protects material
which contains intimate or embarrassing
information if disclosure would constitute
a breach of personal privacy and is of no
legitimate concern to the general public.698
▶▶ Examples

of information excluded
include
information
concerning
pregnancy, illegitimate children, sexual
assault, mental and physical abuse in
the workplace, psychiatric treatment of
disorders, suicide attempts, and injuries
to sexual organs.

○○ Custodians

must redact confidential
information before releasing the public
portions of records. The labor costs
associated with this may be passed on to
the requester.

• Electronic Records:
○○ Electronic records are covered under the
Public Information Act.
▶▶ E-mail may be subject to the act, even

when sent from a personal computer,
if its content meets the standards to
fall within the definition of “public
information.”

▶▶ The Attorney General has determined

that software is not public.699

▶▶ Custodians do retain some discretion

in volunteering records which are not
expressly confidential by statute.

• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:
○○ The provisions of the act apply to every
“governmental entity” as broadly defined in
Section 63G-2-103(11)(a).
○○ The definition of this term includes all

agencies of the executive branch and its
officers.
▶▶ Records relating to the deliberative

process within the office of the governor
are protected.703

○○ The legislative branch is also encompassed,

though it excludes political parties, groups,
caucuses, rules, or sifting committees of the
legislature.

In 1991, Utah replaced the two statutes which
governed access to public records, the Information
Practices Act and the Public and Private Writings
Act, with the Government Records Access and
Management Act, codified in Chapter 2 of Title
63G of the Utah Code. The provisions within the
act create a balance of individuals’ privacy interests
and the public’s interest in disclosure by establishing
four categories of records, which are discussed
further in following sections.

○○ The judicial branch is subject to the statute

along with other rules and regulations, such
as Utah Code of Judicial Administration
Rules 4-201 to 4-206.

○○ The statute does not explicitly cover all

nongovernmental bodies which receive
public funding or benefits.

▶▶ However, certain records which private

entities create or maintain regarding
contracts with public entities may be
open to the public under the act.704

• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ Under the Government Records Access and
Management Act, “[e]very person has the
right to inspect a public record free of charge,
and the right to take a copy of a public record
during normal working hours . . .”701

○○ The act does not expressly cover multi-state

or regional bodies.

○○ Non-governmental or quasi-governmental

○○ The Government Records Access and

Management Act describes four distinct
types of records in determining which
should be made open to the general public.

1. Private records may be released only to
the person of interest within the record
or a parent or legal guardian of the
subject of the record.707 Section 63G2-302 lists many categories of records
deemed private.

• Fees and costs:
○○ Section 63G-2-203 details procedures
regarding fees for providing access to
public records but does not supersede any
other existing statute providing for specific
schedules of fees.
○○ The legislature, political subdivisions, and

the judicial council may establish fees for
their respective public bodies.712

○○ The statute states that fees must be

2. Controlled records may be released to
physicians, psychologists, social workers,
insurance providers, or government
public health agencies if the subject of
the record authorizes such disclosure.708
Section 63G-2-304 lists the few
categories of records deemed controlled.

“reasonable” and only sufficient to cover the
“actual cost of providing a record.”713

○○ If the custodian compiles a record for the

requester in a form not normally maintained
by the agency, costs may include
▶▶ Labor costs associated with searching

for and retrieving information;

3. Protected records may be released
to those who submitted the records,
someone with a power of attorney from
those who benefited from the protection,
or anyone who is granted permission
from those whose interests were
protected.709 Section 63G-2-305 lists 60
categories of records deemed protected.

▶▶ Labor costs associated with formatting,

compiling, and tailoring the record;

▶▶ Any

other direct administrative
costs incurred in complying with the
request.714

○○ The statute encourages agencies to waive

charges under three circumstances:

4. Public records are all other records
which are not private, controlled, or
protected and are therefore not exempt
from disclosure.710 Section 63G-2-301
lists 32 categories of records which are
expressly public.

primarily benefit the general public
rather than the individual requester;
2. The requester is the subject of the

• Enforcement and sanctions:
○○ Those aggrieved by denials of access to
public records have several channels
through which to seek redress. These
rights are not limited to those who actually
requested the record, but to anyone who
wishes to appeal the decision.
○○ Section 63G-2-401 offers anyone the right

to appeal to the head of the governmental
agency. The chief administrative officer
may then order the disclosure or affirm the
confidentiality of the requested record.

○○ If the chief administrative officer denies

the request, any person aggrieved by
the decision may petition the records
committee or file action in court.

○○ Section 63G-2-403 outlines the process for

petitioning the State Records Committee,
which has the authority to hold hearings,
review the records in question, and order
the disclosure of records. The Attorney
General advises this committee.
▶▶ Should an agency fail to comply with

an order issued by the State Records
Committee, it may be liable for a civil
penalty not exceeding $500 for each day
of noncompliance. The committee may
also send a notice of the noncompliance
to the governor, the Legislative
Management Committee, or the Judicial
Council.

○○ Anyone denied access after petitioning the

State Records Committee may file action in
a district court, which may grant injunctive
relief by ordering the disclosure of records
and grant litigation costs to a successful
plaintiff.718

○○ Section 63G-2-801 makes the following

violations of the act a Class B misdemeanor:

or protected records through theft or
bribery or under false pretenses; and

▶▶ Failing to comply with or appeal an

order from the agency, the State Records
Committee, or the courts.

• Exemptions:
○○ All records are public unless otherwise
categorized as private, protected, or
controlled, as previously explained.
○○ The definition of “public record” found

in Section 63G-2-103(22)(b) excludes 14
specific categories of records. A few of these
include drafts, notes, and other deliberative
process material; personal communications;
and proprietary information.

○○ The act does not supersede any restrictions

to disclosure found in the state code
or federal regulations or those deemed
confidential by court order.

○○ Examples of exemptions found in the state

code include Health Department records,
child abuse reports, mental health records,
and tax returns.719

○○ Using the clause found in Section 63G-

2-302(2)(d), courts have ruled that the
release of certain records would constitute
a “clearly unwarranted invasion of personal
privacy.” A few of these include:
▶▶ Addresses of licensed dog owners,720

of requested records.724

○○ Fees assessed for providing reproductions

of public records are subject to the same
limits as fees for all other records. If the
record is the “result of computer output
other than word processing,” then “the
actual incremental cost of providing the
electronic services and products together
with a reasonable portion of the costs
associated with formatting or interfacing
the information for particular users,” along
with the administrative costs incurred, may
be passed on to the requester.726

• Electronic Records:
○○ Records in electronic format are expressly
covered in the Government Records Access
and Management Act.
▶▶ E-mail may be subject to disclosure if its

content is public; however, many forms
of communication are exempt.

▶▶ Proprietary

software and computer
programs are excluded from the
definition of public records.725

○○ Requesters may choose a format in which

to receive records or request a customized
or tailored search but will be charged the
additional personnel costs associated with
fulfilling the requests.

• Money-Making:
○○ Certain public agencies, such as the Driver
License Division, the Tax Commission,
and the Department of Natural Resources,
generate revenue from the sale of databases
to private companies.
○○ The private use of public records may

be regulated by the courts if certain
information is deemed protected, private,
or controlled. However, the statute does not
prohibit commercial use of information.

Common law in Vermont established a right
to inspect governmental records prior to the
codification of the Public Records Law in Sections
315 – 320 of Chapter 5 of Title 1 of the Vermont
Statutes Annotated. The relatively short statute
contains a policy statement highlighting the balance
between individuals’ right to privacy and the public
need for transparency.
• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ “Any person” may request access to public
records under the Public Records Law.727
The act does not define or place restrictions
on the term “person.”
○○ The purpose of the request is immaterial.
○○ The subsequent use of public information

obtained is unrestricted.728

• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:
○○ The act applies to all public agencies, defined as “any agency, board, department,
commission, committee, branch, instrumentality, or authority of the state or … of
any political subdivision of the state.”729
○○ While this definition covers the executive

branch, the courts have recognized an
executive privilege protecting documents

related to the deliberative process of
creating policy. In this case only, the burden
of proving that the document should be
disclosed falls on the requester.730
○○ The

definition encompasses legislative
bodies.731

○○ The courts generally adopt their own rules

regarding open records practices.732
▶▶ Moreover,

the statute specifically
excludes the “records of, or internal
materials prepared for, the deliberations
of any public agency acting in a judicial
or quasi-judicial capacity.”733

○○ The Public Records Law does not explicitly

cover entities receiving or expending public
funds, multi-state or regional bodies, or
advisory boards and commissions created
by the government.

○○ The act defines public records or documents

as “any written or recorded information,
regardless of physical form or characteristics,
which is produced or acquired in the course
of public agency business.”734

○○ All records open to inspection are available

for copying if the public agency has the
necessary equipment for providing copies.
If the agency does not have the proper
resources, it is not required to arrange
for the use of other facilities or provide
personnel to make copies elsewhere.735

• Fees and costs:
○○ Agencies are authorized to collect fees
to cover the “actual cost of providing the
copy” for individuals.736
○○ Custodians may also charge for personnel

costs under the following circumstances:

National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance
Corporation v. Greenlief, 27 Va. Cir. 140 (1992)
In 1968, the Virginia General Assembly adopted the
Freedom of Information Act and granted the public
access to all governmental records not exempted
by a specific statute. Subsequent amendments
have lengthened the list of specific, discretionary
exemptions and have enabled requesters to
recover litigation costs if successful in court. The
Attorney General publishes nonbinding opinions
which public agencies may use for guidance. The
Virginia Freedom of Information Advisory Council,
established by the state legislature in 2000, may also
serve as a source of informal and formal advice for
public agencies and individuals. The nonbinding
opinions of the council may be found online.
• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ Any citizen of the state of Virginia may
access public records during normal business
hours. However, the act does not prohibit
a citizen obtaining records for another
person. Custodians may require requesters
to provide their name and address.
▶▶ The statute explicitly grants the media

which operates in the state the right to
access records.749

○○ The purpose of the request is immaterial.750
○○ The subsequent use of information obtained

under the act is unrestricted.

• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:

and officials of the executive and
legislative branches at the local and
state levels are covered.
◈◈ Working

papers related to the
deliberative process and personal
correspondences among executive
and legislative officials, however, are
exempt.751

▶▶ Public institutions of higher education

are subject to the act.

▶▶ Entities supported by public funding

must disclose public records.

▶▶ Moreover, the act encompasses any

other “entity however designated, of the
public body created to perform delegated
functions of the public body or to advise
the public body.”

○○ Courts have interpreted the act to cover

multi-state and regional bodies, as well.752

○○ Disclosure of judicial records is governed by

other statutes and common law.

○○ The definition of “public records,” also found

in Section 2.2-3701, includes all materials,
regardless of physical format, “prepared or
owned by, or in the possession of a public
body or its officers, employees or agents in
the transaction of public business.”

○○ The act does not distinguish among which

records may be open for inspection and
which are available for copying, but rather
states “all public records shall be open to
inspection and copying.”753

• Fees and costs:
○○ Section 2.2-3704(F) guides the practices of
assessing fees for providing access to public
records.
○○ Custodians may charge reasonable fees not

exceeding the actual cost of searching for
and duplicating the records requested.

○○ Charges shall not include the expenses

of creating or maintaining records or any
other cost that the public agency would
have incurred had the request not been
made.
▶▶ One exception allows public bodies to

charge “on a pro rata per acre basis, for
the cost of creating topographical maps
… which encompass a contiguous area
greater than 50 acres.”

○○ Public agencies must estimate the costs of

the request prior to requiring payment.

○○ Custodians may require advance payment if

the amount is likely to exceed $200.754

○○ The act contains no provisions for fee

waivers.

• Enforcement and sanctions:
○○ Section 2.2-3713 authorizes any person or
the Attorney General to petition for a writ
of mandamus or injunction if denied access
to records.

○○ Examples of these exemptions include

mental health records, child fatality
records, trade secrets, information collected
by the Virginia Port Authority, personal
information, and certain investigatory
records.

○○ Several other exemptions exist throughout

the state code, as the act does not require
the disclosure of any record exempt by state
or federal law.757

common law privileges and have used this
ability in at least one instance by creating
an executive privilege to prevent the
Governor’s telephone records from being

must be disclosed, and custodians must cite
the section of the code which exempts the
confidential information withheld.759

state
agencies,
committees of the General Assembly,
or institutions of higher education must
be filed in the general district or circuit
court of the city of Richmond or of the
county or city in which the requester
resides.

• Electronic Records:
○○ The Virginia Freedom of Information Act
expressly covers public records in electronic
format.

○○ Courts may award successful plaintiffs

to the transaction of public business,

litigation costs.755

○○ Civil penalties may be imposed against

Washington voters passed Initiative 276 as part of
the Public Disclosure Act in Chapter 17 of Title 42 in
1972. The primary objective was to reform campaign
financing and lobbying practices by requiring
certain information to be disclosed. In 2006, the
state legislature reorganized and recodified what is
now known as the Public Records Act in Chapter
56 of Title 42 of the Revised Code of Washington.
New provisions require the Attorney General’s
Office to publish and update pamphlets to serve as
guides for state and local agencies.762 The legislature
also established a public records exemptions
accountability committee which regularly reviews
the exceptions to the act. The state legislature has
passed bills that will take effect in 2010 which will
alter the language of certain subsections, most of
which concern various exemptions found within the
statute. The website of the state legislature contains
the state’s code in its entirety and clearly marks
where changes in the statute will occur.
• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ “Any person” may request access to public
records under the Public Records Act.763
○○ Custodians of public records may not

provide lists of individuals when the request
is for a commercial purpose.

to recognized professional associations
or educational organizations.764
▶▶ Public entities not engaging in “profit

expecting” operations may also receive
lists.765

○○ There are no restrictions on the subsequent

use of information obtained under the act.

• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:
○○ The act applies to all local and state
“agencies,” which include “every state
office, department, division, bureau,
board, commission, or other state agency”
and “every county, city, town, municipal
corporation, quasi-municipal corporation,
or special purpose district, or any office,
department, division, bureau, board,
commission, or agency thereof, or other
local public agency.”766
○○ This broad definition encompasses offices of

the executive branch.

○○ The Office of the Secretary of the Senate

and the Office of the Chief Clerk of
the House are charged with providing
assistance to requesters seeking access to
public records of the legislature.767

○○ The Washington Supreme Court ruled that

the act did not apply to the judicial branch, as
the courts had recognized certain common
law and statutory exemptions not found
in the statute at the time of the ruling.768
The state legislature amended the act the
following year to exempt all other records
which were statutorily declared confidential;
the prior holding may therefore be void.

○○ The act does not specifically apply to entities

which are supported by state funds or which
have members who are elected officials.

award the requester an amount between
$5 and $100 for each day the records were

The West Virginia Freedom of Information Act
is a relatively short statute found in Chapter 29B
of the West Virginia Code. Subject to numerous
amendments over the past several decades, the
act has been changed in response to changing
technology and other events. In 1992, the state
legislature altered the language of the law to
encompass electronic records. In response to the
attacks on September 11, 2001, the state legislature
adopted more exemptions to protect security-related
information. The state’s courts have consistently
interpreted the disclosure provisions of the act
liberally and its exemptions narrowly. According
to one ruling of the Supreme Court of West
Virginia, “the fullest responsible disclosure, not
confidentiality, is the dominant objective.”782
• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ “Every person” has the right to request
access to records under West Virginia’s
Freedom of Information Act.
▶▶ The term “person” includes “any natural

for the purpose of petitioning for habeas
corpus. 784
▶▶ Requesters have greater access to personal

records of which they are the subject.785

▶▶ In certain cases, the requester’s purpose

represents one factor of the balancing
test courts use to determine whether or
not to grant access to a record.786

○○ The statute places no restrictions on the

subsequent use of information obtained.

▶▶ However, courts may impose limits

on the use of personal information
disclosed.787

• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:
○○ The statute applies to every “public body”
which includes “every state officer, agency,
department, including the executive,
legislative and judicial departments,
division, bureau, board and commission;
every county and city governing body,
school district, special district, municipal
corporation, and any board, department,
commission council or agency thereof.” 788
○○ This definition encompasses the executive

branch as well as records of its officers if the
content relates to public business.789

○○ The legislature and its committees are

covered under the act.

○○ The judicial branch is subject to the act and

the guarantee found in Section 17 of Article
III of the West Virginia Constitution.

right to obtain public records.

statutes found in the state code, such as

○○ Any other entity created by state or local

authority is also covered in the definition of

○○ The language allows custodians to use

discretion but provides no mandatory
provisions regarding fee waivers.

as public.

○○ The act broadly defines “public records”

as “any writing containing information
relating to the conduct of the public’s
business, prepared, owned and retained by
a public body.”792

○○ The

Supreme Court has expansively
interpreted this definition as if it read “or
retained by a public body” in prior rulings.793

○○ The physical format or characteristics of

the record is immaterial.

○○ Most records available for inspection are

also available for copying unless doing so
would cause damage to the record.794

• Fees and costs:
○○ With regards to fees, the Freedom of
Information Act merely states that every
“public body may establish fees reasonably
calculated to reimburse it for its actual cost
in making reproductions of such records.”795
○○ The statute provides no definition of “actual

cost” or whether or not labor or overhead
costs should be included.

N.W.2d 158, 175
Some of the very first statutes the Wisconsin
legislature enacted after statehood granted access to
public records and meetings.806 The current Open
Records Law, found in Subchapter II of Chapter
19 of the Wisconsin Statutes maintains the same
presumption of openness. Rather than relying solely
on statutory exemptions, the statute expressly allows
common law precedents to remain in effect.807
The text of the state code available from the state
legislature’s website contains explanatory notes
and references to cases which serve to define and
interpret the Open Records Law. 808
• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ The Open Records Law states that “any
requester has a right to inspect any record,”
though certain restrictions may apply.809
▶▶ Individuals who are “committed or

incarcerated” have restricted access to
public records.810

• The subject of records may have greater right
to access those records if the information was

not collected and kept in connection with a
complaint or investigation or if the release
would not endanger security or safety.811
○○ Requesters are not required to state their
purpose.
▶▶ However, the requester’s motivation may

be used in context of a balancing test
should a denial of access to records be
appealed in court.812

○○ The use of records obtained under the

act may be restricted by other statutory
provisions, as Section 19.35(1)(j) requires
requesters to “comply with any regulations
or restrictions upon . . . use of information
which are specifically prescribed by law.”

• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:
○○ The act applies to every “state or local office,
elected official, agency, board, commission,
committee, council, department or public
body corporate and politic created by
constitution, law, ordinance, rule or order;
a governmental or quasi-governmental
corporation…; any court of law; the
assembly or senate…”813
○○ This definition covers the executive and

legislative branches and their officers.

○○ The judicial branch is also subject to the

Open Records Law as well as Wis. Stat. §
59.20(3).

○○ Non-governmental

entities are subject
to the act if they receive more than half
of their funding from any county or
municipality and provide public health or
safety services.

to the contract as if the contractor were a
public official subject to the act.814

○○ Quasi-governmental entities and advisory

boards or commissions fall under the
definition, as well.815

○○ Multi-state and regional bodies are not

expressly covered, though the records held
by a public official relating to public duties
would be subject to disclosure.

○○ The act covers all public records, including

“any material … which has been created or
is being kept by an authority.”816

○○ This broad definition encompasses all

physical formats of records and is not
limited to only those which public officials
are required by law to maintain.817

○○ Unless the form of the record or its fragility

prevent, all records open to inspection are
available for copying.818

• Fees and costs:
○○ Section 19.35(3)(a) authorizes custodians
to levy fees against requesters which shall
not exceed the “necessary and direct cost
of reproduction and transcription of the
record,” unless a separate statute specifically
establishes a charge for a particular record.
○○ Custodians may charge the actual cost of

locating records if the cost exceeds $50 and
the cost of mailing or shipping copies of
records if applicable.819

○○ Agencies may reduce or waive charges if

such a waiver or reduction is “in the public
interest.”820

○○ In the event a fee is estimated to exceed

five dollars, custodians may require advance
payment.821

• Enforcement and sanctions:
○○ Requesters denied access to records
may seek the opinion of the Attorney
General regarding the particular record in
question.822
○○ Alternately, within 90 days of the denial, the

requester may bring action for mandamus
in court or petition the district attorney or
Attorney General to do so.823

○○ Successful

plaintiffs may be awarded
litigation costs, attorneys’ fees, and damages
of an amount no less than $100.824

○○ If the violation was committed willfully or

intentionally, the requester may be entitled
to actual damages.825

○○ Any

custodian who arbitrarily or
capriciously delays responding to a request,
charges gratuitous fees, or denies a request
for public records is liable for a fine not
exceeding $1,000. The forfeiture is awarded
to the state if the action was brought by
the Attorney General or to the county
if the action was brought by the district
attorney.826

○○ Courts may also award punitive damages

• Exemptions:
○○ Wisconsin relies heavily on common
law to interpret and enforce the Open
Records Law. The Supreme Court has
effectively created a general exemption in
ruling that the public interest in disclosure
must be balanced against interest in
confidentiality.828
○○ The Open Records Law therefore contains

relatively few exemptions, some of which
are mandatory while others remain
discretionary.

○○ As with other forms of records, fees are

limited to actual costs.

• Money-Making:
• Public agencies, unless otherwise prescribed by
law, may not sell copies of public records for an
amount exceeding the actual cost.
• The Open Records Law does not expressly
prohibit obtaining records for commercial
purposes, though it does stipulate that
individuals must comply with any other statutes

The Wyoming Sunshine Law, found in Article 2 of
Chapter 4 of Title 16 within the Wyoming Statutes,
is a relatively short statute that grants any person
the right to access governmental records. In the
few instances in which the Wyoming Supreme
Court has addressed the act, rulings have indicated
a liberal construction of the provisions granting
access to records and narrow construction of the
exemptions.

and judicial branches at every level of
government.

○○ Records of nongovernmental bodies are not

subject to disclosure under the language of
the act. The Supreme Court has not yet
addressed this issue.

○○ As the Supreme Court has ruled that the

act is to be interpreted liberally, the records
of advisory boards and commissions may be
subject to disclosure.

○○ The physical form or characteristics of

the record in question is irrelevant to its
openness.

○○ All

records open to inspection are
available for copying with the exception of
promotional examinations, which may be
inspected but not copied.838

• Who may request records and for what purpose:
○○ The Wyoming Sunshine Law permits “any
person” to request access to public records.835

• Fees and costs:
○○ Custodians are authorized to establish
a “reasonable” fee for providing copies
of public records but may not charge for
allowing individuals to inspect records. 839

○○ The purpose of the request does not affect

an individual’s right to obtain records.836

○○ The statute does not restrict the use of

public information once obtained.

• Whose and which records are covered under the
act:
○○ The act defines “public records” as any
materials “that have been made by the
state of Wyoming and any counties,
municipalities and political subdivisions
thereof and by any agencies of the state,
counties, municipalities and political
subdivisions thereof, or received by them

○○ The act contains no provisions for fee

○○ Section 16-4-203(b) contains six types of

waivers, but the language of the law seems
to allow the custodian to exercise discretion
in levying charges.

• Enforcement and sanctions:
○○ Those denied access to records may request
a statement explaining the reason for
denial. The custodian must cite the law
or regulation which exempts the record in
question.843
○○ Any person who has been denied access to

public records may file action in the district
court in which the record is located.844

○○ Custodians may likewise file action in

the district court to request permission to
withhold records if the disclosure of which
would harm the public interest.845

○○ Any person convicted of violating the act

is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a
fine not exceeding $750.846

• Exemptions:
○○ The Wyoming Sunshine Law contains both
general and specific exemptions. Certain
exemptions are mandatory, while others
remain discretionary.
○○ Mandatory exemptions include any record

which is confidential by state or federal
statute or by court order.847

categories are:

3. Research projects conducted by state
institutions,
4. Real estate appraisals,
5. Interagency or intra-agency memoranda,
