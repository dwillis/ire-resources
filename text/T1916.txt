The article said
PITTSBURG -- With help from a
prominent developer and one of his
business associates, Mayor Frank
Aiello obtained a favorable home
mortgage despite two bankruptcy
filings in the previous six years.
3

The article said
Aiello and his wife … sought refuge
from creditors in 1993 and 1996.
Then, in 1999, after he was elected to
the City Council, they bought a new
five-bedroom house from developer
Albert Seeno Jr. with a down
payment of only 4 percent.
4

The article said
The Seeno business associate … loaned
the Aiellos the rest of the money to buy
the $265,500 home. It was an unusual
mortgage that saved the Aiellos as much
as $43,000 on the down payment and
$484 in monthly payments. And it allowed
them to enter a hot real estate market that
produced a profit of at least $60,000 … .

It often starts with a tip
 A Pittsburg City Council

member had financial
problems
 He now owns a new house

6

The research started online
A Lexis-Nexis property search identified…
 … which councilman recently bought a house
 … the name of the lender
 … the name of the builder

Next stop: County recorder’s office to check
property records.

Who are the people behind the
companies?
 West Coast Home Builders is owned

by Albert Seeno Jr.

 HRO Profit Sharing Plan is affiliated

with Ham Radio Outlet, owned by
Robert Ferrero Sr.

(We know this from our online search, but the confirmation is in the
Secretary of State’s office.)

11

Connection between the lender
and the builder? Yes.
They did business together:
 Ferrero bought a parcel from Seeno.
 Seeno bought a parcel Ferrero had

just acquired from a third party.
 Ferrero sold two lots to Seeno’s son

and carried back a loan.

Key questions
 Was it an unusual

mortgage?
 Could Aiello have gotten the

same mortgage elsewhere?
17

The Aiello financial history
U.S. Bankruptcy Court records tell us that
the Aiellos:
 In 1993, filed for protection from creditors
(Chpt. 13) the day before their house was
to be sold in foreclosure.
 In 1996, avoided paying creditors by filing
for bankruptcy (Chpt. 7).
18

The 1999 mortgage terms
From the deed of trust, we learned:
 Length of the loan: Five years
 Amount of the loan: $255,100 (96 percent
of the purchase price)
 Amount of balloon payment: $269,169
But we don’t know a critical fact: What was
the interest rate?
19

The financial disclosure statement

20

The
interest rate
Frank Aiello’s 1999 financial
disclosure statement
shows the interest rate
was 8.7 percent.

21

Did Aiello get a good deal?
“I got no breaks from anybody. I’m
paying through the kazoo. That’s
the price you pay. When you have
that bankruptcy, you’re going to
pay. I’m paying.”
-- Frank Aiello
22

The mortgage expert says …
People with bankruptcies within the prior
four years generally pay 3 to 4 percentage
points above market rates, and usually
pay principal and interest.
(Source: Michael McGee, president of the California Association of
Mortgage Brokers)

At that time, that meant at least 10.5
percent.

The mortgage expert says …

generally are expected to
put down at least 20
percent.

The legal issue
By accepting the favorable loan
terms, the Aiellos probably violated
state law prohibiting an elected
official from receiving a gift of more
than $320 a year from a single
source, said ethics expert Bob
Stern.
30

The legal issue
"The question is, was it
something a member of the
public could have gotten?"
Stern said. "The answer is
probably no."
31

The legal issue
Jim Sepulveda, Contra Costa
senior deputy district attorney,
said he was uncertain whether
the loan should be considered a
gift.

32

The legal issue
"You could make an argument that it is
a gift because he got more favorable
terms," Sepulveda said. "You could
make an argument that it was not a
gift because there was a deed of
trust, he is expected to make
payments and there is a premium at
the end."
33

The legal issue

The matter is pending
before the state Fair
Political Practices
Commission.
34

Where we went for information
 Lexis-Nexis for overview
 County recorder’s office for property and

loan documents.
 U.S. Bankruptcy Court archives for
financial information.
 Secretary of State’s Office for company
ownership information
 City of Pittsburg for financial disclosure

The message

Public records
are an important
part of reporting
