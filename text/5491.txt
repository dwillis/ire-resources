“The number of data journalists in newsrooms across
the state remains small and they don’t necessarily
communicate with each other. If there is someone in a
newsroom with the title ‘data reporter’ or ‘data
journalist’ they are most likely working as the sole
data reporter in their newsroom.”

The State of Data in Newsrooms, 2018

Who uses data?
- Beat reporters or projects reporters who learned skills on
their own or through IRE
- Designated data reporter or editor (singular)
- A team of several journalists dedicated to data

How can we build lasting support for
this journalism in all our newsrooms?

What can we do to we improve this?

Never assume that data is a priority. Don’t rest on your successes, but constantly be preaching the
value of your work in the organization.
Be visible. Go to every news meeting and be present. Have your data team standup meetings in
the center of the newsroom where everyone must see them.
Find a partner-in-crime who will support you and will carry the torch when you can’t.
Join a community of others like you (there’s a slack for lonely coders, for instance, or NICAR-L) It’s
helpful when you need advice on things like professional development or approaching your boss for
a raise.
When hiring, especially on smaller teams, look for people who are self-starters who can carry
themselves without a ton of direction
Make yourself invaluable. Befriend metro reporters and introduce them to census tracts or build a
tool for the crime reporter to easily look up crime figures
The currency of the newsroom is always the story. Get great stories and make sure your
bosses, and your bosses’ bosses understand what special data skills enabled you to do it.
