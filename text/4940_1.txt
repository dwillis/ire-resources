SEC Basics: What, When?
■ 10-Ks (due 60 days after FY ends)
■ 10-Qs (due 40 days after FQ ends)
■ 8-Ks (within 4 days of trigger event*)
■ DEF-14A (due 120 days after FY ends)

■ Prospectus/Registration Statement*

NOTE: Annual Reports are not
mandatory; rely on them at your
peril: 10-K disclosures may be
legally omitted from the AR!*
NOTE: Private companies with no
public shareholders still must file if
they have publicly traded bonds

The Juicy Parts
■ Forward-looking statements
■ Risk factors
■ Legal issues – “Commitments and
Contingencies”
■ Amendments versus former versions
■ Boardroom ties, “related party” deals
■ Committee reports – audit, compensation

■ The AR Rorschach Test: tone, ego,
expense, omissions

Rules of the Road
■ All companies with publicly traded
stock or bonds must file
■ Many filings (proxies, 10-Ks and
10-Qs) come at predictable times.
■ February, March and April are the
busiest times of the year

Where to Find SEC Filings
■ EDGAR: The SEC clearinghouse;
search by either ticker (AMZN) or
name (Amazon)*
■ Investor Relations pages
■ Yahoo! Finance, Google Finance, etc.
■ Subscription services (for power
users)

Getting Started…
■ Focus on one particular company.
■ Start with one you encounter regularly,
like Amazon, Apple, Google (now
known as Alphabet), Facebook, or
Twitter.
■ Start with the proxy statement,
formally known as the DEF-14A. That
has the “sexiest” information, like CEO
pay.

The Proxy Statement
■ The proxy statement is essentially an
invitation to the company’s annual meeting.
■ Summary compensation for the 5 top-paid
executives
■ Compensation details for company’s
directors
■ Related-party transactions (nepotism, CEO
conflicts, director dealings with company,
etc.)
■ Shareholder proposals

The 10-K – The Motherlode
■ Erroneously called the “annual
report”
■ By far the biggest filing – a big
company may file 500 pages or
more
■ Use “search” function and key
chapters headings - handout
■ Read dynamically and
comparatively

The Basics of the 10-Q
■ Public companies report earnings 4 times a
year.

■ 3 times a year, they also file a 10-Q, an
expanded version of the quarterly earnings
report
■ Bigger than an 8-K, but smaller than the 10-K
■ Companies may file the day they release
earnings or several weeks later – if so, beware!
■ What’s behind the headline numbers the media
picks up? It’s in here.

The 8-K – aka “News”
■ 8-Ks can be filed at any time.

■ They tend to be short – maybe one
sentence with a press release attached.
■ Topics run the gamut: an executive stepping
down, an accounting issue, a regulatory
issue, a lost lawsuit.
■ Filing may be timed to minimize attention:
after 4 pm EST on a Friday, e.g. – but MUST
occur within 4 days of event

Strategy: Dribbling
■ On April 18, 2013, Microsoft announced
record earnings right after the market closed
at 4 pm.
■ Release noted CFO was leaving, but no
details.
■ At 4:07 pm, Microsoft files its 10-Q
■ One hour later, it files the resignation
agreement paying departing CFO $1 million
■ Total pages filed over course of 1 hour: 85

Strategy: Flooding the Zone
One day flood:
■ On June 17, 2013, Weyerhauser filed 4
separate 8-Ks and 2 other filings and did a
“special presentation” for investors
■ Total page count: >350 pages
Multiple flooding incidents:
■ In month of May, 2013, Meritor filed 6 8-Ks, an
amended 10-K, a 10-Q and a few other things.
■ During the prior two Mays, it filed just one 8-K!
■ Total page count: >500 pages

Strategy: Friday Night Dump
■ Friday, June 14, 2013: 101 8Ks filed – 44 after 4 pm
■ Typically, 9% of all 8-Ks each
week are filed on Friday after 4
pm
■ Pre-holiday weekends even
worse

Strategy: Monday morning dump
■ The SEC electronic window closes at
5:30:59 on a Friday. Anything filed
after that is automatically held until
first-thing Monday morning
■ We’ve seen companies filing at 8 or 9
pm on a Friday, so the filing date
reflects Monday.

Strategy:
Forward-looking Hide and Seek
■ A growing trend: companies dumping
significant information in the forwardlooking statements in the earnings report.
■ On Feb. 21, 2013, as part of its 509-word
forward-looking statements section, HPQ
inserted language about “risks associated
with HP’s international operations” for the
first time.
■ Difficult to catch, but provide insight into
something that may “graduate” to a risk
factor.

Strategy: The Big Bag of Tricks
■ Using different or confusing exhibit numbers, which
makes it harder to find and compare various
changes in a document
■ Using different words to describe the same thing
■ Burying something in an amended filing – watch for
10-K/A, 10-Q/A, 8-K/A!
■ Dumping a bunch of amended filings on the same
day

■ Announcing limited details about an executive
departing and then burying separation agreement
in next 10Q or omitting it
■ Spelling out numbers! Puh-leeze!
