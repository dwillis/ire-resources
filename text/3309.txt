How to get the story on the record

JOURNALISTS ONLY PLAY OFFENSE: The best way to avoid anonymous-source journalism
is through aggression.
THE BEST EDITOR IS AN OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR: Insist on corroboration,
documentation, home visits, return visits, ratcheting and aggressive (though polite) questioning.
BE READY: Background everyone you talk to, prepare yourself with a command of every detail,
like an athlete would for a big game.
MAKE NO EASY DEALS: Never grant anonymity blithely. Never talk to anyone off the record.
Background is the only option.
INTERVIEW THEIR FEARS: Never argue with a person who insists on anonymity. Interview
their fears. Proper questioning will guide the person onto the record.
MAKE NO INFORMAL DEALS: Layout in detail the terms of any background agreement.
RATCHET: Alert the background source that you intend sometime to talk them onto the record.
Afterwards, or days later, ask why a particular item can't be said on the record. Once that item is
on the record, point out others - and so on.
FAVORS: You should always be polite and you can be courteous and transparent, but avoid
performing an outright favor for a source.
TREAT A SOURCE AS A WINDOW, NOT A SHELF: A background source should at least
serve as a guide to other sources of information - documents, court records, emails, tips on other
informed individuals, introductions to others, perhaps even a midnight visit to the files.
FIND ANOTHER WINDOW: A locked door isn't the only way into a building, and the same is
true for any story. You will find, in fact, that the person who originally locked the door will
unlock it when they discover you are in the building talking to others.
TELL WHAT YOU KNOW: Sources often open up, on the record, when a well-informed
reporter lays out what he or she already knows (with caution ... don't poison the well or guide a
wrongdoer to cover up information). Tap their curiosity; remind them that they'll want to know
what you are discovering.
SHOW UP AGAIN: Sources gain confidence with repeated visits. Door slammers relent when
you politely re-appear.
