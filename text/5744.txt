Sarah’s oﬃce at IRE

Third Quarter 2017 IRE Journal

Kate Howard from
the Kentucky Center
for Investigative
Reporting...
“I absolutely keep up with
my findings when they’re
written in colored
dry-erase marker
directly over my desk.
What started as a small
square of questions to
ask evolved into a
diagram that took up
nearly a whole wall.
I revisited it every day
and talked things
through with my editor
at least once a week so
I didn’t lose track of little
details and old
questions.”

Label your notebooks. Use small Post-Its
to mark where each interviews starts + the
date. Use different colors for beats,
projects, etc.
◉ Create a digital ﬁling cabinet. Use
keywords and folders (including
sub-folders) for email and computer.
◉ Embrace version control. No more ﬁles
called “IRE18_Final2_FinalFinal.” Use the
date + initials for each draft.
“IRE18_SH061418”
