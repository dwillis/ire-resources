Red flags to look for regarding
Chinese drywall:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Repeated air-conditioning failures
Corrosion of wiring in electrical sockets and other spots
Corrosion of plumbing components.
Blackening of metal jewelry, ornaments, mirrors and other items in
the home.
Failures of electronic devices like televisions, computers and
appliances.
A sulfur-like or vinegar-like smell (some affected homes have no
odor).
Rust or corrosion of galvanized metal components like hurricane
clips and framing plates.
Health problems: respiratory, sinus problems, severe headaches,
and nosebleeds – among other symptoms -- have been reported by
many residents.
– Health officials are taking the matter VERY seriously; they still do not
know the extent of what exact chemicals are at play and their effects

Congressional Action
US Senator Bill Nelson, D.-Fla
• Sits on the commerce committee (which has power over consumer
safety issues)
– Hearings likely? Count on it. Just a question of when.
• USA Today, NPR, Katie Couric, anyone?

• The most active member of Congress right now who is looking at
this (no surprise, he’s from FLORIDA)
• His nudging that got the CPSC to launch its formal compliance
investigation recently. He’s also pushing EPA.
Nelson's
s staff heading up efforts on the drywall issue is:
• Member of Nelson

occasionally completely on the record.)

others)
th )

Federal data: Customs, now rolled into Homeland Security, also maintains data –
though it generally does not identify individual companies, only aggregate amounts.

•

Port operators: never hurts to talk to the local port folks. A lot of operators are
intimately familiar with what they are seeing coming through.

Builders Who Used It
• More than two dozen suspected, if not
more. Confirmed
C fi

builders
ild
iinclude:
l d
– Lennar
– WCI
– Taylor Morrison
– Beazer
– Numerous local builders

Lennar
• Builder thus far known to have the most affected homes
in Florida
• The company
p y hasn’t p
provided any
y numbers since
January, when the number of homes it suspected or
knew had the drywall was 120 in SW Florida alone.
• One development near Sarasota, “Heritage Harbour,” at
least 30 homes affected – including 23 on one street
called Montauk Point Crossing.
• Lennar is attempting to repair some homes – though it’s
being quiet about which ones and what it’s
it s doing
– Before repairs, owners must sign extensive waiver of rights
absolving the company of future damages, known and yet
unknown
– Disposal locations? Still a mystery.

Local builders
• A personal favorite among affected builders:
“Aubuchon Homes”
• Florida State Rep. Gary Aubuchon, R-Ft. Myers,
owns the company. It used the defective
drywall.
• Turns out one of the homes it built with it? The
p
millon-dollar home Lt. Gov. Jeff Kottkamp.
• And one more rub: Aubuchon holds the same
seat that was vacated by Kottcamp when he
became Lt. Gov.

Bottom Line
• Much of what precise contaminants in the drywall is
g the reactions is still UNKNOWN
causing
• It could be more than one thing – sulfur, ammonia, other
chemicals? Sulfur is the main suspect, but no one really
knows yet.
– The HEALTH implications – is it dangerous to you and your
children, etc. – are particularly still unknown.
• Only studies released so far have been paid for by Lennar and
Knauf
• FL Dept of Health supposed to release preliminary findings any day
now. Could take another two months for more comprehensive tests
• CPSC doing testing to determine property damage, but EPA
supposed to look at health (so far no tests by them yet)
