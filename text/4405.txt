Types of PDFs / Issues
Native

Scanned / Flattened

●

Created by PDF software (e.
g. Adobe or Cometdocs)

●

Scanned documents are essentially
photos with pixel material

●

Can be selected, copied and
pasted

●

Once-native docs may be flattened or
locked against C/P but not run
through scanner

●

Extraction will copy out text,
but it may be messy or
missing layout

●

Requires OCR and/or image
interpretation

So many options!
