Getting your feet wet: Data
projects you can try anywhere
@TVNewsJamie & @kcrowebasspro

Infrastructure Stories
- People in a lot of places, especially aging cities, are worried
about the same things:
- Potholes
- Water main breaks
- Pavement quality

Potholes
- People hate them
- They damage cars
- They’re a reminder of worsening infrastructure
backlogs
- We’re coming into pothole season right now

Two cases: Milwaukee vs. L.A.

Mapping city services in L.A.

What do you need? Where do you get it?
- The basics: location, date reported, date repaired, political district, census
tract.
- Benchmarks: How fast does the city think it should repair potholes? How
often does it meet that goal?
- Same for water main breaks.
- Data from surrounding communities? Do you work in an area where you’re
comparing cities?
- The data will come from the Department of Public Works, or a Streets
Department.
- Pavement quality is a bit different: the city, county or state should have
shapefiles or databases with grades for each section of street.

Claims & Lawsuits vs. Government

What to get and who has it?
- Check for a Risk Management department.
- Look for the form claimants have to file with the government
before they can sue.
- Get the claims and lawsuits, but also the expense data:
- Outside Counsel
- Legal Experts
- Property Damage

Tax delinquents
- There a many different taxes people and businesses pay to
state or local governments. I mainly check out two kinds:

- State taxes
- Property taxes
- Municipal Court Delinquents

State Taxes
- Look into people and organizations who do business with the state.
- Does the state have people on its payroll who owe it money? Businesses?

Property Taxes
- Big issue in Rust Belt cities, or any city or county still stuck in a
recession.
- Bank foreclosures have slowed, but tax foreclosures might be on
the upswing. This means the city ends up taking properties.
- One problem property can have an outsized effect on an entire
street.
- Also check how good your government is about collecting taxes.
Does it collect 90%? 95%? What are the implications?

‘Property-tax debt is ravaging Philadelphia’
“For the roofers and substitute teachers who make their homes on the 4400 block of
Orianna, the failure to enforce tax law has diminished both quality of life and property
values. That single ruinous, tax-delinquent house has lowered the value of the homes
within 500 feet by a total of $38,000, a new analysis finds.
When the effects of other nearby delinquents are piled on, the total hit to the value of
these working-class homes approaches 40 percent, lowering their worth to about
$55,000 apiece.” - Patrick Kerkstra, For The Inquirer
Investigation also found the city doing a poor job of collecting taxes, creating budget
holes for city departments and schools.

Municipal Court Fines
- Check out who’s getting fined for what.
- What happens if people don’t pay?
- Use ordinance violation fines to track down slumlords.

Payroll Data
“Dixon consistently has
doubled his salary through
overtime, and he made about
$20,000 more than the chief
last year. Dixon worked 1,818
hours of overtime, giving him
more than any public safety
employee in South Hampton
Roads and bringing his total
compensation to about
$141,000.” - The Virginian-Pilot

Payouts for unused vacation and sick leave

“Jeff Dusek was one of San Diego County’s most prominent prosecutors,
successfully handling some of the region’s highest profile murder cases. He
was known as a hard worker, who spent a lot of weekends in the office. He
rarely took a sick day off in his 34 years at the District Attorney’s Office –
except for gall bladder surgery.
The accumulated sick pay turned into a cash payout in January when Dusek
retired. The county cut him a check for $118,605.20 – the biggest sick pay
cash-out in recent years.” - inewsource, San Diego

Check for other perks
- Car allowances for politicians.
- Furniture budgets?
- The different kinds of pay: Do they increase the
pension payouts?

Fuel Inspections
- Everybody loves a good gas prices story
- But what if you’re not getting what you pay for?
- Check with your Dept. of Agriculture or Weights and Measures

Fuel Inspections

Airport Usage
- Is your local airport being used as much as the Chamber of Commerce says?
- Is it really practical or necessary to expand the facilities or flight availability?
- Use RITA data to find out: http://bit.ly/newsdata_airport

Airport Usage

City Vehicles Leaving Town
- You paid for it: How much gas are your city workers guzzling by taking city cars
home 20, 30, 40, 50 or more miles? A lot.
- Request data on city employees who take cars home, their departments and where
they live

City Vehicles Leaving Town

Cafeteria Inspections
- Do your area’s schools have dirty cafeterias?
- More importantly: Are they being inspected at all?
- Request or check inspection reports from the department of health

Cafeteria Inspections

Standardized Test Cheating
- Are students cheating on tests? More importantly - are teachers? Probably.
- Request standardized test discrepancy reports from your department of education

Standardized Test Cheating

Daycare Inspections
-

Similar to cafeteria inspections, you just have to look
Are they being inspected regularly? If they don’t pass, what happens?
In this case, our story was what records are NOT available easily for parents
Sometimes when it appears there are records, people feel like they’ve got good
information - BUT it may be incomplete

Daycare Inspections

Puppies! Kennel Inspections
-

Everyone loves a dog story.
See if your state inspects or records complaints about kennels or breeders
In Missouri, it was the attorney general’s office
We found the AG’s system… wasn’t necessarily doing what was intended

Back in My Day… I Walked to School in the Snow
- Data can make fun stories!
- Compare the snow days your schools get with NWS data about snowfall…
- Are they cancelling school more now? Or is grandpa just getting cranky and
telling tall tales? (Pssst… it’s the second thing in Missouri)

- TSA Complaints
- Untested Rape Kits (State Police)
