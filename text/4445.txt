dedupe
or, what to do in a world without unique IDs

Campaign finance
Who donated the most?

Messy names and addresses make answering
this accurately very hard.

Linking tables
List of scofflaws +
List of permit seekers

What’s the intersection of these two?

Geocoding
List of messy addresses +
List of addresses with locations

Can I geocode these without paying $$$?

These are all the same problem.

Solve it with machine learning!
What a human does

teach dedupe about what similarity means in a
particular dataset, by judging a few examples
What a machine does, that humans can’t

Apply “lessons” about similarity to new records,
at scale

How to scale

100,000 records: 5 billion comparisons.

Structure the unstructured
Natural language processing (NLP) parsers
usaddress - addresses in the US
probablepeople - person names
parserator - make your own parser

Case study: county vendors, campaign contributors

It’s all open source!
