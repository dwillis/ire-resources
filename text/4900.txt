Digital Data Love
The One Secret Trick:
Data Negotiation

My argument: Digital data may be easier and
faster to acquire than good old paper documents.
Which is actually not saying very much, given that
FOIA can take years.

Field Layout, or, Your Bible

The Key: Negotiate
● Who ‘owns’ the data
● Set up a meeting between
you, the FOIA officer and
the IT person
● Negotiate Each Column
● Be Prepared To Give

T. Christian Miller | ProPublica | @txtianmiller | IRE 2016 | tinyurl.com/IRE16-Digital

What you MUST wind up with

● Field Layout
● Data Dictionary
● Primary Keys

T. Christian Miller | ProPublica | @txtianmiller | IRE 2016 | tinyurl.com/IRE16-Digital

Step 4: Access
● CSV format — universal,
best option for most data
● TXT or Tab Delimited —
Almost as good
● Excel — Not ideal, but
very common

The Import
● For most files, you can use Excel to peek

The Import
● Many potential pitfalls
● Date/Time are a special hell
● Field Layout will save you
● May require coder
intervention
