Ocean Acidification:
NOAA scientist Richard Feely:
I’ve heard him called the “Father of Ocean Acidification.” He’s among the leading experts on tracing
isotopes in the ocean water and linking them directly to anthropogenic fossil fuel combustion.

Taylor Shellfish, Puget Sound, WA
The largest shellfish aquaculture company in the nation and is at the very forefront of society’s
discussion on ocean acidification. Certainly, their business depends on finding solutions. But they’ve
taken on an interesting role as a company advocating on this issue far beyond their specific needs and
concerns.
Bill Dewey leads the company and is as well-versed as most scientists. Media friendly.
