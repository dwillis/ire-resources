The digital divide
✿ Admit it: You’re a news nerd. (You’re at

NICAR, aren’t you?)

✿ Most of your colleagues are not.

✿ But with just a little training they could do a

lot:

❀ Track budgets and crime trends
❀ Investigate campaign spending
❀ Even do custom sports stats!

Think of your audience
✿ They’re smart people with very little spare

time.

✿ There are fewer of them now than two years

ago. They need to improve their skills to
survive professionally – and you can help.

✿ The big difference between them and you:

You know some computer code that hasn’t
become obsolete yet.

Things I’ve learned
✿ Do skills assessments to plan training around

specific group

✿ Use relevant data
✿ Find data they can take back and work on

Things I’ve learned
✿ Make it fun - competition

✿ Quick tip sheets on bright paper – folks will

be able to find on their desks

✿ 11-minute break

Teaching options
✿ Boot camps: Great to get in-depth training,

but hard to get folks to be able to take that
much time off

✿ Sleep-away boot camps: Trainings such as

NICAR boot camp allow for more focused
learning away from the office

✿ “Quickies”: Focused one-hour tasks –

calculating and sorting, pivot tables, If
statements that build on each other

Teaching options
✿ Find super users – By developing some

power users, they can help others

✿ Outside speakers – Special power of the

outsider

✿ One-on-one training

Dealing with personalities

When classes won’t work
✿ Write tip sheets

✿ Write practice exercises
✿ Conduct brown bags
✿ Hold “office hours”
✿ Recorded training/webinars

Tip sheet basics
✿ No question is too basic
❀ How do I launch this program again?
❀ What exactly does it do, and why should I care?
❀ How do I save my work?

✿ Different people learn different ways
❀ Include both written instructions and illustrations
❀ Repetition is essential

Example

Tip sheet ideas: Excel
✿ Simple formulas (math, percent change!)

✿ Importing, text-to columns, formatting
✿ Sorting and filtering
✿ Mining the Internet
✿ Pivot tables
✿ Charts

Tip sheet ideas: Access
✿ Why use a database manager instead of a

spreadsheet

✿ Importing and data types

✿ Query Wizard
✿ Query Design
✿ Relational queries
✿ Make tables

Mac newsroom?
✿ Access is for PCs only, but …

✿ SQLite (Firefox plug-in) or MySQL work on all

platforms

✿ Both are free!
✿ MySQL can handle far more data than

Access.

✿ Downside: Both require more comfort with

SQL queries.

“How do you get to Carnegie Hall?”
✿ Practice, practice, practice! (Exercises)

✿ Build exercises for each basic skill.
✿ Keep each exercise simple: One or two skills

per exercise, with each step spelled out.

✿ Include a simple practice dataset with each

exercise.

✿ Provide the correct answers (in a separate

area so they can check their work).

Example

Fun data to train with
✿ Salaries

✿ Accidents: Amusement park, bicycle, snow

mobile…

✿ Census: Population, race, jobs, income,

commute times

✿ FBI Uniform Crime Reports
✿ Restaurant inspections

Key concepts
✿ All data is dirty – vetting and cleaning data

✿ Interviewing data
✿ Fighting for data

Beyond the basics
✿ After spreadsheets, there are other tools

that can help people advance their
nerdery.
❀ Mapping

❀ Stats
❀ Basic coding – Make cleaning and

processing easier
