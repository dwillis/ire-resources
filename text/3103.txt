NASA National Aviation Operational Monitoring Service
This is infamous pilot survey that NASA did with pilots on safety issues that NASA then would
not release without AP suing them. When they did release the data it was in almost
incomprehensible form. IRE and NICAR are still working on collating and interpreting the data.

NTSB (National Transportation Safety Board)
http://www.ntsb.gov/
While the FAA will investigate some crashes, it is actually the NTSB which conducts all
investigations of major airplane crashes, especially those involving death. It is this agency which
is charged with coming up with an official cause of crash (when possible.) NTSB keeps an up-todate database of all major crashes in the US and the parts of the World where NTSB
investigators are involved.
