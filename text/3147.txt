“Once in awhile you can get shown the light in the strangest of
places...if you look at them right.

EVI L !!!
• It’s too easy
• Discourages enterprise
• “Oh, just look it up online.”
• Most information starts on PAPER!

Google is the DEVIL!!!
It makes us lazy. Is it the best source? What about:
• Telephone-Assisted Reporting
• Almanac-Assisted Reporting
• Encyclopedia-Assisted Reporting
• Reference Librarian-Assisted Reporting

Wikipedia is worst of all!!!
• Has no authority
• Can be edited by any dummy
• Their mistake is your mistake
• But a good road map
