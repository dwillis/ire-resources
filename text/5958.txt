THE ART OF THE INVESTIGATIVE INTERVIEW
Linda Byron, Former King 5 Investigator, Adjunct Professor, UW Tacoma

PREPARATION:
1. Check them out: Whether they’re a friendly source or the target of an expose, search
Google, Linked-In, Twitter, Facebook, court records, professional credentials, etc.

2. What do you need from the interview?



Facts/Information (Do you even need them on camera?)



Expertise/Insight (Put your findings into perspective)



Emotion/Heart (Victim’s story, heartbroken friend, angry lawmaker)



Accountability (Can be confronting a wrongdoer or demanding answers from those
with the power to fix the problem)

3. Write out your questions:


Highlight the most important questions, but rarely refer to them until after the
interview ends so that the conversation flows organically



Formulate follow-ups in advance according to anticipated responses

DURING THE INTERVIEW:


LISTEN!



Respond to what you hear instead of just following your list of questions



Take viewer perspective



Circle back: check your list, re-ask anything they didn’t answer



Open the door: Is there anything you want to tell me?

TECHNIQUES THAT WORK FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF INTERVIEWS:
1. Tipster / Source:


Challenge and verify the information



Ask: “How do you know?” “How else do you know?”



Ask: “Who else knows?”



Ask: “Will you connect me/act as an ambassador?”

2. Accused Person:


Acknowledge the interview might be painful but you need them to tell their side



Yes or No—Did you do it?



Be specific about key facts—define terms



Ask for verification: “Did you tell anyone about it back then?” “Do you have
documentation?”

3. Victim / Witness:


Use present tense: “Take me back, you’re at home, the doorbell rings…”



Let them talk, using prompts: “And then?” “Huh” “What did you do next?”



Statement questions: “That must have been hard” “That must have been a red flag”



Ask for explanation: “Why did you trust her?” “Why do you think this happened?”



Seek verification: “Did you tell anyone about it? “Do you have documentation?”



Be friendly but remember this is a professional relationship

4. Expert:


Have them examine your documentation on camera



Ask them to help make sense of your findings



Ask for insight: “Why is what I’ve uncovered important?” “Is this a problem you’ve
seen before?” “Have you or other experts sounded alarm bells about this problem?”



Referrals: “Who else should I talk to?”

5. Wrongdoer:


It may help to play dumb before revealing what you know



Let them tell their story before presenting contradictory evidence



Ask the hard questions and have documentation ready



Ask “elephant in the room” questions: “Are the tears because you got caught?”

6. Confrontation Interviews:


Ask for an on-camera interview before ambushing someone



Consider severity of the offense



Identify yourself and have microphone and camera visible



Have three questions ready if they stop and talk to you & three if they walk away



Ask bottom line questions



Don’t argue or get angry, be politely persistent
