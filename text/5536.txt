September 15, 2018

Four key areas for a statehouse reporter:
• Legislation, new laws
• How money is being spent in government

• Exploring how public policy works
• Public corruption/scandal/questionable behavior

Tips on following legislation, new laws
• Find the website in your state where you can look up bills.
• Read the bill, EVERY time it gets voted on
• Find the fiscal analysis (called a fiscal note in Louisiana) for the bill
• Check in with the National Conference of State Legislatures for context on
bills. (Google also works too.)
• If you don’t understand a bill, call the staff member who wrote it

Sources for budget, finance stories:
• Read the budget bill (Ours is called House Bill 1)
• Talk to legislative budget staff
• Talk to recently retired state employees who handled finances
• Read through reconciled bills that are voted on during the last day of
session, especially if they are fiscal bills
• Check out audits

Following up on those new laws, policies:
• Interview people in the real world affected by policy debates
• Those budget cuts or increases? Figure out what they actually mean
• Follow up on economic deals to see if they work out
• Keep a calendar so you can track goals, benchmarks
• Get out of the office/classroom

Checking corruption, questionable behavior
• Look at bills filed by legislative leadership
• Request new elected officials’ calendars
• Looking at who is missing votes – and what votes they are missing
• Check out the occupations of lawmakers’ children, spouses
• Get familiar with campaign finance laws
