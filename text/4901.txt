Protecting Your Sources
Using Encryption and Other Tech Tools to Keep Your Work Safer
IRE 2016
Jennifer Valentino-DeVries, The Wall Street Journal

What Should Worry You?

What Should Worry You?
● The NSA? Eh, Maybe.
○
○

It’s true the NSA, other Five Eyes agencies and more gather many phone-call records, Internet
traffic, financial and travel data, etc.
Still, for the most part, this is not likely a major threat to you.

● Subpoenas and Leak Investigations? Yes!
○

Laws in various countries allow access to records stored with other companies, such as Google.
In the U.S., this is known as the Third Party Doctrine

○

You may have stronger protections using company-provided equipment and accounts. Ask a
lawyer!

What Should Worry You?
● Accidental Disclosure
○

You might not realize how much data you make available.

○

Prime example: John McAfee, found after Vice Magazine published a photo online that still had
metadata including geolocation. Oops!

What Should Worry You?
● Criminal Hackers
○

Newspapers and journalists are hacking targets, for the information they have as well as for
“lulz,” or amusement and fame. Major outlets have been hacked to get early information related
to financial markets, for example.

Getting into Amazon let my hackers get into my Apple ID account, which helped them
get into Gmail, which gave them access to Twitter. The very four digits that Amazon
considers unimportant enough to display in the clear on the web are precisely the same
ones that Apple considers secure enough to perform identity verification.

What You Can Do: Understanding

What You Can Do: Understanding
● Metadata
○
○
○

Even if people can’t access the content of your communications, they can learn a lot about you.
Cell phone Records: These include location, whom you called, when.
Again: YOUR CELL PHONE GIVES OFF YOUR LOCATION DATA

○

Photos and Documents: Can have information on location, creator of the document, creation
date and more. This can reveal your sources!

○

Even things like building card swipes are revealing. (Those were actually used in the James
Rosen case.)

What You Can Do: Understanding
● Threat Modeling
○

Know your adversary

○

Are you more worried about subpoenas, phone tracking, your source's employer, your own
employer, criminal hackers?
What does the adversary want to know, and how skilled are these people?
What are the consequences of failure?
Examples of threat modeling:

What You Can Do: Understanding
● Threat Modeling: Specific Issues for Journalists
○
○
○

Your biggest threat problem may be sources' unwillingness to take security steps.
You frequently have little control over your company's security.
Threat actors may differ from story to story.

● Threat Modeling: Examples Can Be Helpful
○
○

Consider the James Rosen case
Issues in that case include emphasis on speed, lack of knowledge of metadata

○

"If this sort of conduct, the badgering of sources and constant contact, is typical, there is
seriously no hope."

What You Can Do: Tech Basics

What You Can Do: Tech Basics
● Use Existing Tools
○

Antivirus gets a bad rap, but not having it is stupid. Any reputable vendor is fine. I have McAfee
at work, Sophos on my Mac at home.

○

Use a VPN when traveling. It won’t protect you against everything, but it is safer than Starbucks,
hotel WiFi, etc.

● Update to the Latest Software
○

More recent software patches flaws that hackers exploit.

● Avoid Phishing and Similar 'Easy to Prevent' Attacks
○
○

Everyone thinks they wouldn’t fall for email attacks. But somehow these work. All. The. Time.
Another possible vector: Free USB sticks. JUST SAY NO.

What You Can Do: Tech Basics
● Good Password Hygiene

What You Can Do: Tech Basics
● Good password Hygiene, cont'd
○
○

For very important passwords, you can use the “Diceware” method, outlined here:
http://juliaangwin.com/privacy-tools-how-to-build-better-passwords/
http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html

What You Can Do: Tech Basics
● Consider a Password Manager
○

1Password: https://agilebits.com/onepassword
■ Costs $50-$70
■ Available for Windows, Mac, iPhone, Android
■ Can be used in browser or just desktop

What You Can Do: Tech Basics
● Use Two-Factor Authentication
○
○
○

Here, you have a password and the service sends you a separate code so you can log in
Available with Google/Gmail, Apple, Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and more
A good list here: http://bit.ly/1gQdLXd

What You Can Do: Encryption

What You Can Do: Encryption
● Encryption encodes information so other people can't read it unless they have
the proper "key."

What You Can Do: Encryption
● Signal, An Encrypted Phone App
○
○
○
○
○

Free!
Available on iPhone and Android, in the app stores
Allows private texts, calls, video and image exchange
Must be with others who have the app
For security, you should delete texts etc.!

● WhatsApp
○
○
○
○

Recently started using the same tech as Signal
May be easier to get sources to use it, because it is more common
Having it on a phone may arouse less suspicion
It is owned by Facebook, and there may be some metadata concerns

What You Can Do: Encryption
● OTR "Off the Record" Chat
○
○
○

Different from Google Hangouts' off-the-record feature!
Uses special programs, and both users must be on it.
Follow the instructions I have written up here: http://bit.ly/1cR8AIC

● PGP / GPG Email
○

Can be used to protect the content of emails, but DOES NOT protect email metadata.

○

I wrote up some basic instructions here:
https://jennifervalentinodevries.com/2012/01/22/how-to-use-pgp-for-more-secure-email/

What You Can Do: Encryption
● Computer Encryption
○
○
○

This encodes the files sitting on your computer, so anyone without the password will see
gibberish.
On Mac: Use built-in FileVault http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4790
On PC: Use the built-in BitLocker if you’re on Windows 7
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/features/bitlocker

What You Can Do: Other Steps

What You Can Do: Other Steps
● Try the Tor Browser
○
○

A tool that helps you hide your tracks on the Internet and when browsing the Web
Main drawback is that it can be very slow.

○

Get it at https://www.torproject.org/

● HTTPS Everywhere
○
○

A browser plugin that helps you keep more secure connections to websites
Go to https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere

What You Can Do: Other Steps
● For Sharing Documents: Onionshare
○
○
○

Onionshare.org
Have to use it with Tor
Allows peer-to-peer sharing

○

Source must already be in contact

● Newsroom Platform: SecureDrop
○
○
○

https://securedrop.org/
Must be installed by experts
Allows whistleblowing from anonymous sources

What You Can Do: Other Steps
● Secure Erasing
○
○
○
○

When you delete files normally, information is left behind. You can, however, overwrite this
information.
On PC, I use CCleaner: https://www.piriform.com/ccleaner
On older versions of Mac, you can use Finder > Secure Empty Trash
On Mac El Capitan, you can follow these instructions:
https://www.intego.com/mac-security-blog/how-to-securely-empty-trash-in-os-x-el-capitan/

Final Words of Caution

Final Words of Caution
● Computer security has limitations. If your work is very sensitive, old-school
operational security, which is tedious and difficult, will be important.
● If your life or your source's life is in danger, DO NOT rely on computer tools to
save you.
● Beware that encryption can be a “red flag.” The NSA is more likely to keep
encrypted communications “just in case,” for example.
● Security is only as good as the weakest link: If your network is “pwned” or you
have a keylogger on your computer, crypto won't help.
● If a national government actor really wants into your machine, it can get into it.
● For many of these tools, you may need to persuade your sources to use them.
This can be tough. But even if that’s the case, your awareness of these
techniques can help you later.
