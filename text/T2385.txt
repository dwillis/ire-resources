You are not a stenographer. Listen. Look. Think. Act.
Focus on promises and pledges, rules and policies, and laws. When they are broken, it makes for good,
great and fantastic stories.
About promises: Get them down pat when they are made. Politicians love to promise things. Developers
do, too.

W Be not afraid - to cut a source. As long as you are fair and accurate, they will come around.
W Remember that investigative stories almost always lead to more investigative stories.
W The best stories seem to start with tips, not fishing expeditions. Keep that in mind.

Keep an investigative mindset. Probe. Stay organized. Make time for your investigative work - get good
enough to cover your beat in, say, 6 hours and then spend 2 or 3 on the investigations.
W Try to have a three-day, three-week and threemonth story going. Or two-two-two.Or four-four-four. The

idea is always to be pulling string on an enterprise story.
