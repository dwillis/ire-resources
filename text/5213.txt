Investigating special education
Brian M. Rosenthal, The New York Times

A little background…
• “Special education” is help meant to ensure that kids with disabilities
get a “free and appropriate education” (FAPE) like everybody else
• “Help” = Tutoring, counseling, therapy, transportation, modified curriculum…

• It is not…
• For all students with disabilities (some can get a FAPE without special ed)
• A separate class (most “special ed kids” get helped in regular classroom)
• Only for public school students (all children aged 3-21 are eligible)

• It is…
• Individualized (each eligible student gets IEP laying out their specific services)
• Legally guaranteed (schools are required to follow IEP, can be sued for not)
• Mostly funded locally (the feds pay only about 15 percent of costs)

• Relevant laws: Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA; 1st version
1975), Rehabilitation Act (1973), Americans with Disabilities Act
(1990)
• (More information: www.houstonchronicle.com/denied/resources/)

Basic questions to ask
• Are schools giving special ed to whom they should be?
• Are schools allowing too few kids into special ed? Too many? The right ones?

• Are schools actually helping those in special ed?
• Are schools writing meaningful IEPs? Following the IEPs? Providing real help?

• Are schools following the law?
• Are schools following process? Involving parents? Integrating kids in regular class?

• Is somebody gaming the system?
• Is somebody using system to profit financially? To help in rankings? To get ahead?

• Is somebody being hurt?
• Are special ed students being inappropriately restrained? Secluded? Abused?

• Is somebody ensuring accountability?
• Are there metrics providing accountability? Rules to hold bad actors accountable?

• (All of the above can be asked for your state as a whole, and also for a
specific region, district, school, disability type, age, race, gender…)

Where to find the answers
• Data, data, data
• Special ed evaluations, entries, exits, test scores, seclusion, discipline...
• Obtain it from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), from the
Office of Special Ed Programs (OSEP), state ed department, local districts
• Slice it by region, district, school, disability type, age, race, gender
• If you ask it to be de-identified, you can get almost anything

• Reports filed each year by states and districts
• Ask feds/state for “Annual Performance Report” and “State Performance
Plan”

• Lawsuits
• Look for cases filed by parents against local school districts

• Human sources
• Parents, advocates, special ed teachers, tutors, therapists, counselors,
diagnosticians, general ed teachers, principals, special ed directors,

When you find the story
• Make sure you know what’s going on
• Special ed is complicated. Things may not appear to be as they seem

• Determine if it’s a school story, district story, state story, regional story
or national story
• Consult the pros (advocates, experts, regulators, statisticians)
• Good source: Former U.S. Department of Education officials (especially
because there’s a lot of turnover)

• Cast a wide net
• Often, the most helpful people are the hardest to find

• Remember that the story is ultimately about real people
• Documents, documents, documents
• Write!

Restraints & Seclusion
• Restraints are physical holds in which a student’s
ability to move their head, torso, arms or legs are
limited.
• “Mechanical” restraints use something artificial like
straps, handcuffs or bungee cords to do the
restraining.
• “Seclusion” refers to situations in which a student is
confined against their will in a room they are
prevented from leaving.

Students with disabilities represent about 12% of all
students in public schools nationally. But they make
up 67% of the students subjected to restraint or
seclusion in school.
- From a “Dear Colleagues” letter issued by the U.S. Department of Ed civil rights office in Dec. 2016.

“…restraint or seclusion should never be used except in situations where a child’s
behavior poses imminent danger of serious physical harm to self or others, and
restraint and seclusion should be avoided to the greatest extent possible without
endangering the safety of students and staff.”
US Department of Education 2012 voluntary guidance on restraint & seclusion

“We have hundreds of examples of kids who are being restrained
and secluded for behaviors that do not rise to the level of causing
harm to themselves or others.”
Cindy Smith, policy counsel at the National Disability Rights Network.

Our story with NPR focused on the case of Carson Luke: Luke, who is
autistic, was 10 years old when school staff members crushed his hand in
a door while trying to close him in a seclusion room at a public school in
Chesapeake, Va.

How to connect with families:
• National Disability Rights Network: Contact your state’s office
• COPAA: Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates
• Your local special education attorneys and advocates: web searches
or word of mouth
• Court records & social media searches (closed Facebook group:
Stop Restraint & Seclusion)
• Visit a special education school and talk to parents in the parking
lot after dismissal
• Us! heather.vogell@propublica.org: We may have local tips to
share.

Our analysis found: 163,000 instances of restraint.

7,600 reports of "mechanical" restraint. (Arrests not included)
Seclusion: Children placed in "scream rooms" roughly 104,000 times.

Student-based documents:
• Notifications to parents or other
reports on restraints/seclusions
• IEPs
• Functional Behavioral Assessment
(identifies problem behavior,
triggers and prevention & coping
strategies)
• Behavior Plans
• Emails to parents.

Each year, nearly 20,000 youngsters with severe disabilities are sent
to live at special education schools at public expense.

In less than five years, AdvoServ’s Carlton Palms facility
put its residents in mechanical restraints 28,000 times,
state records show.

“They tortured him.”
-Lorraine Kennedy-Shields, Adam’s mother

Records on abuse & neglect:
• Autopsies, child death investigations, law enforcement
reports
• Medical records
• Child protection agency stats and, sometimes,
confidential reports
• Restraint reports – tallied up or, if parents help, the
individual restraint reports.
• Injury reports to parents or to regulatory agencies
• IEPs and FBAs.
• Emails to parents.

Lobbying records further detailed their influence:
Look at whose campaigns companies and
their principals contribute to, who they
hire and what those folks do to further
the company’s interests.

Emails between regulators opened a window on the company’s behind-thescenes maneuvering…
The company threatened to go over bureaucrats’ heads:

And resisted requests by government officials to document what they were doing with students:
