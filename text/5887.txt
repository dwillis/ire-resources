FISCAL YEAR VS. FORM YEAR
Fiscal year versus form year can be
confusing, so we’ve put together the table
below to help frame up the differences.
•

•

Fiscal year represents the year in
which an organization’s financial books
closes.
Form year, on the other hand, aligns
with the beginning of an organization’s
fiscal year.

Organizations have an initial filing deadline
of the 15th day of the 5th month after the
fiscal year ends but can ask for two 3month extensions, often delaying their
filing until 11 months after fiscal year end.
