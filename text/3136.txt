Or film the monitor showing the
website you’re taking the clip
from.

Don’t take photos off of a webpage
and make them into a separate
graphic so that it looks like its your
photograph

If you can’
can’t get permission
and a screen shot doesn’t work
then we have to see if our use qualifies as a “fair use”
which is a defense under the Copyright Law

Navigating the Social Network Minefield

Four components of Fair Use
1. Character of the use
2. Nature of the work to be used
3. How much of the work is reproduced
4. Market Harm

Navigating the Social Network Minefield

Please don’t add “Courtesy of…” when
you haven’t gotten permission
It has no legal value – and it’s false,
since it hides the fact that we’ve taken
the material without permission.

The balancing test varies from State to
State and from court to court, so if you’re
thinking of claiming “Fair Use,” call your
lawyer first.

“This is why social networking is becoming such a
powerful force in business communications, yet most
newsrooms have yet to embrace it. Most of our story
research is still very linear. With business social
networking, you can communicate with thousands of
people simultaneously. “

Questions to ask yourself before using web material

Is the photo or video actually what the person providing it
says it is?

August 2007 – During its coverage of the Minnesota
Highway Bridge Collapse, WCCO received photo
submissions that were not taken by the submitters, but
were in fact AP and Getty images.

July 2007 - WFSB-TV, Hartford, CT used a photograph
of a large tornado in its coverage of severe
thunderstorms. The person who sent it in claimed it had
been shot on his father's Connecticut farm.
After using it, the station discovered that the picture had
been taken more than two years before in Kansas.

Does it look like a professional photo or video?

Is it shot from a he licopter or other aerial perspective?

head shot companies at malls. The photographers usually
retain all reproduction rights, despite the fact that the subject
paid for their photos.

Not a lot of people have access to helicopters, so if it’s an
aerial perspective, check further.
