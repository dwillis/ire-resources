What is the American Community Survey: A rolling monthly survey designed to replace the
long-form census by 2010. The survey will contact about one in 480 households monthly. Data
released annually beginning in 2006 will include about one in 40 households and will provide
annual summary data for places with populations of 65,000 or more. Places of 20,000 to 65,000
population will require three years of collected data. Places with less than 20,000 people will
require five years.
When: The first full production sample of 3 million households is being take this year. The data
will be released in August 2006. But The Census Bureau has been working up to this since 1996.
Summary data for states and for places with populations of 250,000 or more â€“ from a samples of
about 700,000 households -- is available for 2000-2003. Data for 2004 will be release later this
summer. For places between 20,000 and 65,000 in population you'll have to wait until 2008, the
first year three full sample years will be available. For places of less than 20,000 people, you'll
have to wait until 2010.
What we get: Profiles of demographic, social, economic and housing characteristics; Year-toyear change profiles; Ranking tables; Detailed summary data; Public Use Microdata Sample (a 5
percent sample of individual responses).
To make the data more user-friendly, the census will provide confidence interval upper and lower
bounds in the profiles and detailed data tables, and year-to-year tables will mark changes that are
statistically significant. No more calculating confidence intervals!
Warnings: Samples before 2005 include only people living in households. They don't include
group quarters, which could be a problem for military or college towns. Also, margin of error will
be larger than 2000 census, and sample sizes for smaller areas may vary from year to year.
