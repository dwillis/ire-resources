Don’t believe the hype:
how to report on a scientific study, part 2

Anatomy of a research paper:

Anatomy of a research paper:
1. Abstract (aka the CliffsNotes version)

2. Introduction
3. Methods (the how and the why of the how)

4. Results (the what)
5. Discussion (the so what)

6. Conclusions
7. References/Supplemental section

There’s no rule that you have to read a paper in the
order it’s written!
1. Abstract
2. Introduction
3. The figures and tables in the results
4. Methods
5. Now go back to the beginning and read again chronologically
(but honestly, do whatever makes the most sense to you.)

Things to consider when reading a research paper:
-

Does the research question matter?
Can I trust the research?
What am I trying to get from reading this paper?

Figures
graph axes – do the axes begin at zero? Units and scale?
Are there error bars? How tight are the error bars?
Impact factor – how frequently is this study being cited, who’s citing whom?
Conflicts of interest
Who is funding the research? Do they have a vested interest?

Things to consider when reading a research paper:
Methodology -- is the study sound?

Sample size and statistical analysis

Experimental controls
Excluded data points

General questions I like to ask scientists:
Were there any obstacles you had to overcome to get your experiments to work? What
and how?
What are the limitations of your research? (aka “I don’t want to blow this out of proportion,
so how does this translate to real life?”)
Can you suggest an expert(s) in your field not involved in this study to comment about
your experiment? How about an expert(s) in the field who disagrees with you?
Can I come watch you do xyz in the lab? You never know if they might say yes, especially
in academia.
