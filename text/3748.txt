Help Wanted: Jobs for the Disabled
The Columbus Dispatch, http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2011/05/22/farbelow-minimum-wage.html
List of employers who hold special wage certificates can be found at the U.S. Department of
Labor.

The 14(c) applications are subject to FOIA and are supposed to contain the name, disability, job
title, job site and average hourly wage of every employee.
They are subject to FOIA but we used Ohio’s Public Record Law to collect them from taxpayerfunded county disability boards. We asked for the full applications submitted for Authority to
Employ Workers with Disabilities at Special Minimum Wages. In shorthand, these documents
are known as “14C applications.”
The Institute for Community Inclusion, which is at the University of Massachusetts in Boston
supports the rights of children and adults with disabilities to participate in all aspects of the
community, has a wealth of resources and data on adults with disabilities:
http://www.communityinclusion.org. We used the institute’s methodology to pull data from the
census on poverty among various classes of disabled adults – physical, intellectual, etc. – as well
as other important demographic information.
The institute also surveys state-disability agencies on employment-related data that provides
helpful information on numbers of adults who are working in the community, in sheltered
workshops or not at all. The institute keeps historical data so we could compare Ohio across
time and how it compared across the country.
We used Guidestar to collect financial histories of the sheltered workshops:

With a premium account, we were able to download the financial information from Ohio’s
sheltered workshops into a spreadsheet.
