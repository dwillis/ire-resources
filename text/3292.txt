DIFFERENT KINDS OF COLLEGES GET THEIR MONEY AND SPEND THEIR MONEY IN DIFFERENT
WAYS

SOURCES OF REVENUE
Tuition
Endowment Earnings
Gifts
Grants (including overhead, which is about 1/3 of the total. .. a bit more at privates, a bit less at publics)
Other ‐‐ auxilliary (things like room & board profits, tech transfer, continuing and executive ed.)

HOW THEY SPEND IT
Instruction
Research ‐
Academic Support
Public Service
Debt Service (!)
Student Services

IMPORTANT DATA and WHERE TO FIND IT
Endowment ‐ Nacubo Survey in The Chronicle
Tuition ‐ really, what matters is the Net Tuition Revenue (less the discount rate).
Amount of money they raise ‐ Council for Aid to Education survey
Faculty Salary ‐ AAUP
Administrative Salaries CUPA
Sponsored Research ‐ Don't forget non‐governmental research (NSF, NIH) Research contracts are hard to get,
but they can be FOIA'ed at public U's.

DOCUMENTS etc
Annual Report (generally not audited)
Audited Financial Statements
Official Statements ‐ if the college is carrying debt. get them from the issuing authority
Form 990 ‐ has info on overall debt (mortgages too.) not to mention Conflicts of Interest disclosed, trustee
dealings; poke around Guidestar for related agencies that they might not disclose
Credit Rating Reports ‐ Moody's rates nearly 600 colleges, S&P does fewer, Fitch even fewer but some.
(Moody's "medians")
Financial Responsibility Score from the Ed Dept. (also their own composite financial index; sometimes you can find
it)
Accreditor's actions ‐ sometimes they list financial concerns

The Chronicle of Higher Education’s online databases about academe
Jeffrey Brainard, Manager of Editorial Research
jeff.brainard@chronicle.com, (202) 466-1085
I want to take you on a tour of some data on The Chronicle of Higher Education’s website that
reporters might find useful in covering their local universities. These data are not available in one
place anywhere else, or some of the sources charge a hefty fee.
Because The Chronicle is a niche publication with a loyal readership, our content is behind a pay
wall. However, I can provide reporters free access to our website upon request; contact me at the
e-mail address above. Our main data page, Special Issues and Data, is at
http://chronicle.com/special/ . An archive is at http://chronicle.com/stats/archive/archive.htm .
We’re redesigning our website; look for the ‘Facts and Figures’ tab on the new home page,
http://chronicle.com
Many major debates today in higher education revolve around data and the lack thereof. These
include the high cost of college tuition and the low quality of college undergraduate education in
America. Here are some of the national databases that we have built ourselves or obtained from
other sources.
- Compensation of college presidents. Pay and benefits for colleges’ chief executives have
steadily grown, triggering outside scrutiny because of the recession and spiraling tuition. The
Chronicle annually compiles a searchable database of presidential compensation. The data come
from the IRS tax filings known as Form 990’s, which contain much useful information about taxexempt charities, including private, nonprofit colleges. The Chronicle collects 990s from
hundreds of those colleges and conducts its own survey of an additional 184 public universities
and 64 community colleges. We highlight the top moneymakers, for example, the president of
little-known Suffolk University in Boston, who led all college CEOs in 2006-7 with total
compensation of $2.8-million.
Home page for package: http://chronicle.com/indepth/compensation/
Public-colleges database: http://chronicle.com/stats/990/public.htm
Private-colleges database: http://chronicle.com/stats/990/private/private.htm
- Compensation of other employees. College presidents draw most of the heat for high pay on
college campuses, but another recent story using the same 990 data found that the CEO’s
actually represent a minority of the 300 highest-paid employees in academe. Medical-school
physicians and athletic coaches predominate. These data are not on our web site because we are
selling them as premium content, but we will give the data to reporters for free. (For The
Chronicle’s article based on these data, see ‘Who’s Making The Most,’
http://chronicle.com/special/ )
- What professors make. You can compare pay for presidents against that for faculty members
at colleges in your area. The gap is big and growing as some presidents’ pay soars and faculty
pay is mostly flat. We have a searchable database of faculty pay by institution and academic rank

(i.e. full professor, associate professor, etc.), compiled by the American Association of
University Professors, at http://chronicle.com/stats/aaup .
- Academe’s pork barrel. Congressional earmarks have become a notorious symbol of wasteful
spending and questionable ethics by Congress. The Chronicle’s website offers 15 years of annual
data (through FY2008) about billions of dollars handed out by lawmakers to colleges in their
home districts for pet projects (see a searchable database and related stories at
http://chronicle.com/stats/pork ) The available evidence contradicts the main argument offered in
favor of earmarks -- offered, not coincidentally, by those who receive, award, and lobby for them
-- that these noncompetitive set-asides for scientific research help colleges build research
programs that can compete successfully for money handed out by federal agencies the normal
way, that is, open, merit-based competitions.
You can find earmarks on your own by searching the 2009 appropriations bills for colleges in
your area. Beware, however, that millions of dollars in additional earmarks for your state’s
research institutions may be hidden in the Defense spending bill, despite Congress’s boasting
that it has made earmarking transparent. You can use press releases from your Congressional
delegation to track down the intended recipients of some of these mystery earmarks, whom
legislators are not required to identify in the bill. Or ask your legislators -- the spending bills
must list each earmark’s sponsor -- who they intended to receive the money. Also keep in mind
that Congressional spending bills frequently name as intended recipients mysterious “centers”
and “institutes” that are, upon closer inspection, part of universities.
Finally, check out whether your local colleges are among the growing number that have spent
hundreds of thousands of dollars annually on Washington lobbying. Most colleges that lobby do
so predominantly to receive Congressional earmarks. The Chronicle reported that colleges and
universities spent $62-million in 2003, double the amount spent just five years earlier, making
academe one of the biggest clients of lobbyists in Washington, on par with defense contractors.

- Enrolling needy students: how the wealthiest colleges rate. This 2006 story examined the
prevalence of Pell Grants, which go to the poorest students, at colleges with endowments over
$500-million. The story’s lead read: "Elite colleges have made headlines in recent years with
financial-aid plans aimed at enrolling more low-income students. But despite those efforts, the
proportion of financially needy undergraduates at the nation's wealthiest colleges and universities
actually dropped between the 2004-5 and 2006-7 academic years, according to a Chronicle
analysis of federal Pell Grant data." The data, covering 114 colleges, are at
http://chronicle.com/weekly/v54/i34/5434pell_table.htm Perhaps some of these are in your
coverage area.
- Where students using the GI bill go to study. A majority of veterans and current service
members attend community colleges and proprietary colleges, citing the low cost and the
convenience of online courses, The Chronicle found. Only 6 percent of all college students
choose for-profit institutions compared with 19 percent of GI-bill students. That matters because
many graduates of those institutions earn only a certificate or an associate’s degree, which

doesn’t bring a salary as high as a bachelor’s degree does. Our story
(http://chronicle.com/weekly/v54/i46/46a00101.htm ) includes a list of the top 25 institutions
with the largest GI-bill enrollments.
- U.S. Department of Education data. The agency’s database, the Integrated Postsecondary
Education Data System (http://nces.ed.gov/ipedspas/), contains extensive data about colleges’
finances, student aid, enrollments, and employees. The Chronicle used this database to show that
colleges’ spending on instruction was increasing by more at the wealthiest institutions than at the
least wealthy, measured by endowment per FTE student
(http://chronicle.com/weekly/v52/i31/31a00101.htm .)
You could examine IPEDS’ data about your local colleges’ graduation rates. This rate is the
percentage of entering freshmen who earn a bachelor’s degree within six years. This could be an
important accountability measure -– but bear in mind the limitations of these data. IPEDS only
counts full-time, first-time students, although part-time students increasingly attend many
colleges. Also, graduation rates don’t account for students who transfer to another institution,
where they may complete a degree; IPEDS regards them as non-completers at the first college.
IPEDS’ data are often at least two years out of date and are self-reported by colleges.
The Chronicle’s web site has a wealth of other data and survey results about administrators,
faculty, students, and institutional finances. Here is a taste:
- Censored institutions: 46 institutions censured by the American Association of University
Professors over academic freedom and tenure (http://chronicle.com/indepth/labor/censure.htm )
- A few institutions have narrowed gaps in graduation rates between black and white students
(http://chronicle.com/weekly/v54/i34/34a02001.htm#success ), but
most black students attend colleges with low graduation rates for black students
(http://chronicle.com/weekly/v54/i34/34a02001.htm#odds )
- Income from patenting and licensing scientific discoveries for 155 universities
(http://chronicle.com/weekly/v55/i22/autm_data_revised.htm )
- Great Colleges to Work For, a Chronicle survey
(http://chronicle.com/weekly/v54/i45/great_colleges_tables.htm )
- Grading the states: the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education awarded letter
grades to the states based on how well they deliver higher education (and the results weren’t
flattering.) (http://chronicle.com/weekly/v55/i16/16a01401.htm )
