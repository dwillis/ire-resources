INSPIRATION
Any medium can inform the look and feel of the video investigation. Adapt production styles from
feature films, television shows, viral videos and magazines.
Hitting a wall? Need to get inspired? Check these out:
TV.NPPA.ORG – The National Press Photographers Association hosts a quarterly clip contest where the
best visual journalists in television news battle it out for bragging rights. This page has video links to all
of the winning pieces. It’s a great place to see what great minds are up to.
CASEYNEISTAT.COM – Casey Neistat is an incredible storyteller and filmmaker. Check out his YouTube
videos. They have a fantastic style; part “maker movement,” part action film.
COSMOS (FOX) – With wonderful skill and class, host Neil deGrasse Tyson is able to visualize and
illustrate seriously complex topics. The way they presented the Cosmic Calendar is a great example of
how to put images to an abstract idea.

QUICK TIP – Hang on to any generic video and file those clips into an archive. Keeping an easily
accessible library of frequently used b-roll will save you time in the future.
QUICK TIP – Be creative when shooting unidentifiable video. Close-ups show the viewer a detail they
might not have previously noticed, and it’s also a good way to keep a subject’s identity safe. When you
want to get wide shots, put an object in between the camera and your subject, blocking the person’s
face. You can also focus on something in the foreground, leaving the background, and your anonymous
subject, blurry.

QUICK TIP – Use different methods to call out text in documents. Pull outs and rip outs are fine, but you
can also use arrows or a fade and blur method to single out single words and phrases.

QUICK TIP – Give texture to digital documents by printing them out and scanning them. The process
gives the document some a natural paper texture, which helps bring it to life.

NUMBERS
We work really hard to obtain figures for our stories. We should work just as hard to present them in
a creative way. Use graphics to incorporate numbers into the environment of your topic. When you
arrive at a location, look around and try to think of what would work as a canvas to paint your
graphics on.
Standups offer an opportunity to bring this concept to a different level. Think about how to
incorporate the numbers into the standup to help reinforce the point the reporters is trying to make.

HOW TO DEAL WITH BAD VIDEO
When a story centers around video that’s less than ideal, take the opportunity to transform those
clips into something greater. Vertical video is common offender, but instead of seeing this as a road
block, use it as an opportunity to be creative.
