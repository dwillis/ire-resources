First ask: How does this story sound? We aren’t talking about whether this will be a short radio
feature, a radio doc, or a full podcast episode or series. Think instead about the basic elements
associated with your investigation -- the voices of the people affected, those in power, any action
and natural sounds of whatever issue you’re tackling (guns, healthcare, housing, etc)
FOIA audio just like you would documents. (memos, video tape, webinars - anything that may
have sound)
Always be recording. Like - do it.
Have people show you action, not tell you action. Make your interviews active, interact with the
subject and get yourself on tape doing so
Turn documents into tape by revealing docs to interested parties. Often as investigative reporters
there comes a moment when we “reveal” findings to subjects and ask for a reaction. Record this
interaction, and don’t just do it with a target of the investigation. Take it to the person affected,
and record that as well.
Always record interactions with public information officials because…
○ a) you never know when that’s the only tape you will have of the agency.
○ b) radio is a glimpse into how we do our work. Showing those battles makes you
transparent and is also interesting.
○ c) your tape adds a level of public accountability.
○ d) Taped interactions may be useful for other reasons….
Before you start writing, start talking There are infinite ways to experiment with
storytelling/narratives, articularly with long-form audio documentaries and podcasts. But which
way is right for you? Test out your story by talking about it, from different angles, with people
around you. See how they respond, and that may give you a good place to start your writing
Things don’t have to be linear, but they do have to make sense You don’t have to tell a story in
chronological order, but that can help listeners hang on throughout a long piece.
Before you can get listeners to the meat of the story, you have to hook them early Like, really
early. In the first 2 minutes. So make sure you concentrate hard on where and how you start the
story. Successful opens to audio investigations:
○ Intrigue the listener
○ Make people curious about what comes next
○ Have authentic voices
○ Are direct about the subject/nut graph
○ Give a hint of scope
It’s unlikely people will rewind to catch a point -- so be clear the first time around, and repeat

yourself
Prioritize people over numbers. Many investigations are about abuse and power. Audio is already
an intimate medium, so lean in even further and let us hear the abused, powerless as well as the
policy/people being held accountable
Don’t make your story a list of numbers. We get it. We’re investigative reporters and we loveeee
data and numbers. Guess what? Our ears don’t. Save your 121 findings for the companion web
piece. For the audio story, zoom in on the most important 1-3 numbers, data points and make
your story about reinforcing those.
Cliffhangers in audio are cool. But don’t go overboard.
Help people keep listening. That means relying on all sorts of subtle audio tricks. Signposting,
Repeating main concepts. Recapping, Foreshadowing. Music.
Be ruthless about killing tape that doesn’t answer a question or build out the character
Figure out what you’re making.
○ Serialized? Determine if the story has enough legs to be chopped apart into chapters (the
exception is a breaking news podcast, which would have a built-in driver of action)
○ Longform? Feel free to let the story breathe a bit
○ Feature length radio? Condense the above steps
Get to know your tape like it’s your bae Log/Transcribe it yourself if possible
When writing …
○ Write for the ear, not for the page. So after you have words down, read them outloud.
Read them to other people.
○ Vary the ways you get in/out of tape, especially in a long piece. Everyone doesn’t have to
be a back ID. Allow people to introduce themselves. Don’t over=explain/set up bites -trust listeners to pick up on things.
○ Can tape take your place? If someone says it better than you, let them.
○ Can you say it better than the tape? Do that.
When tracking …
○ Talk to a crowd.
○ Know that tape.
○ You do you, but maybe get a producer.
Edit … and then edit again.
○ Edit the script on paper.
○ Edit the sound with your ears.
○ Bring in new ears with live reads
○ Edit in different situations (while driving, while walking your dog, in a noisy place, etc.)
Plan for the folo A new chapter? An on air discussion? Behind the scenes?
