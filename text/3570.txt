* Name: teri see * City and State: Astoria, Oregon * …I
sit here with tears streaming down my face as I read
your report about these deaths that could have been
prevented except for profit and greed. And to
discover that Remington knew at the time of my
lawsuit that they were guilty just makes my heart
ache…

According to my source, Remington has been investigating, tailing, following
in your footsteps for the last several months and is preparing to launch an
intensive internet campaign to refute whatever claims you report this
evening and personally discredit those involved in the story.
I am told that over 600 interviews have been conducted in this campaign
effort and that -- as early as this afternoon -- a website will be launched to
discredit CNBC.
The link I was given is -- www.Remington700.tv -- it is supposedly going to
be launched this afternoon, in advance of your evening airing.
