CONFRONTATION
• PREPARE!!!
Condense notes/file
Write major questions

• STAY FOCUSED/ MAINTAIN CONTROL
Subject will give a moving target
Stay on center!
If they don’t answer the question - ask again

• DON’T TALK TOO MUCH
Silence is very powerful
They may fill the void with important information

• WHEN IN DOUBT – “COLUMBO” IT
“I probably misunderstood, but did you just say…”

• DO NOT MISS A MOMENT
Listen!!!
Pounce on the misstatement/lie

• LIES ARE A GIFT TO THE INTERVIEW
Let them hear their own words
“Wait a minute! You just said…”
Give them a chance to retract
Usually they are committed
Tear it apart!

CULTIVATION :
• KNOW THY SUBJECT
Who is he/she?
Arrogant? Family? Drinker? Talker?
Use sources to paint picture
PSYCH 101!

• HOSTILE OR NOT?
Assume it will get hostile – Most people do not like the truth!
Do NOT rule out possibility of sitting down – full disclosure.

• DO NOT GIVE AWAY YOUR STORY.
Be general
Do NOT lie!
If possible, find a natural connection between the person’s position and the general theme
Work on what they DO want to talk about.

• THE LONGER IT TAKES TO DECIDE – THE LESS
LIKELY YOU WILL GET A “SIT DOWN”
More time means more information for the subject
They will research you
They will assume the “worst”

• DON’T GIVE UP - BE PERSISTENT
Give the subject clear deadlines
Make it clear you MUST get a comment – even if it’s “no comment”
Explain the importance of the story you are working on.
A “sit down” interview is always better.

• DOES NO MEAN NO?
…or can you meet in the parking lot?
Not YOUR decision alone.
Now up to organization.
Do NOT surprise your bosses!

• POINT/COUNTER-POINT
Boring? Waste of time?
Get Expert.
Get position statements/qualifications from subject.
Find Technique to WEAVE the story.

• HANDLING THE HANDLERS
They will repeat the message instead of answering the question.
Don’t stop asking
Don’t give up high moral ground
