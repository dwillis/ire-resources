As the abuse of steroid-liki supplemdnts became more Widely dlscovered, athletic and meUical groups I
pressed for stricter legislation, argu- :
iog that y substancethat tutns into
a sieroid ormme once it is digested
should be regulated by the Drug EnforcementAdministration.
But faced with oppositionfrom Mr. '
fiatch, lawmeers ultimately decided it was not worth sinking the entife bffl'y ban DHEA; severe said.
The law, whi* was passed without
. objection, gave the Drug Enforcement Agministration more power to
ban new steroids,with one named exemption,PHEA.
'
''Wehad to make a practical deck
sim tb'get it pass&," said Representative John E. Sweeney, Republican of New York.
~epre~entative
Henry A. Wax- '
man, Democrat of California, said
DHEA was protected "bbedause of the
economiCpressureSfrom the dietary
supplement 'people that stand to
make a lot more
money by-sellingj&"
----Besides the supplement industry
and its select advocates In Congress,
Mr. Waxman said: "No one else argued it should be given an exemp
tion. The only opposition came from
the supplements industry, and
they're makink millions off the sale
of DHEA supplements!' ,
According to one Congressional
aide who worked on writing the legislation, in one particularly intense ne. gotiation with Senator Hatch, the
' Utqh senator's staff members "were
adamant that they were not g o m to
take out the exemption!'
Other current and former Congressional staff members - all
speaking on condition of tinqnymitl
bedause they were not authorized to
talk about back-room negotiations - ,
gave similar accounts. One senior
aide who helped broker the agreement said: "We had tcl do an exemp'
tion for DHEA not because it was the
right thing to do, to be perfectly honest, but because it .was the politically
necessary
- --------_ thing to do."
