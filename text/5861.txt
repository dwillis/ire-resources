Tips for Covering Opioids and Drug Misuse / Maia Szalavitz maiasz@gmail.com
1) Watch Your Language:
Would you write an article about schizophrenia that calls patients “lunatics”? Using the term “junkie” or
“dope fiend” is just as unacceptable in writing about addiction, unless people choose to use this language to
describe themselves. Yes, “people first” language like “people with addiction,” is clunky, but the
Associated Press Stylebook now prefers this term, in line with its style on other mental disorders 1.
The phrase “drug abuse” should also be discarded. It was formerly a diagnosis in psychiatry’s Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual (DSM), but was removed, in part because research showed that the term actually
increases medical professionals’ desire to punish, not treat 2. “Drug misuse” is preferred to refer to drug
problems that aren’t as severe as addiction.
In the latest edition, DSM 5, the official diagnostic label for what is colloquially called addiction and was
previously called “substance dependence” is now “substance use disorder, moderate to severe.” 3. Do not
use the term “dependence” as a synonym for addiction: addiction is defined as compulsive behavior
despite negative consequences and is always problematic. In contrast, dependence is simply needing
something to function and may not be harmful (for example, pain patients, people with diabetes who need
insulin, people on medication to treat addiction).
Finally, don’t use “clean” or “dirty” to refer to recovery and active addiction. We don’t describe people
whose depression or high blood pressure recurs as “dirty”— even if they haven’t been compliant with
treatment.
2) Start with Science:
When covering cancer or other medical illnesses, reporters rely on experts at research universities or the
National Institutes on Health. There are not one, but two, National Institutes devoted to addiction: The
National Institute on Drug Abuse4 and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism5. Use
them! (Although they favor removing stigmatizing language from their names, they can’t be changed
without an act of Congress.)
There are also Cochrane reviews6 about what works and what doesn’t. You wouldn’t rely on a local family
doctor for the most up-to-date view of the state of medical science— you should do so even less when
talking addiction with local counselors because there are no federal education requirements7 for being an
addiction counselor or even running a treatment program. Many states don’t even require a high school
degree.
And many addiction programs are for-profit: there are no requirements to prove what they do is effective
or even safe— and no standards for their claims about “success rates,” which is why if quoted at all, they
should not be falsely equated or directly compared to data from peer reviewed studies.
One final note on sourcing: police are not experts on addiction: they are not required to have any training in
pharmacology, psychology, sociology or statistics and their views on drug use are no more valid than any
other anecdotal perspective.
3) The Treatment You May Think is the Worst is Actually the Best:
Guess which treatment for opioid addiction is the only one known to reduce the death rate by 50% or more?
It’s endorsed by the World Health Organization as “essential”8 and is also acknowledged as the standard of
care for opioid addiction by NIDA9, NIH10, ONDCP11, the IOM12, and basically every other agency that
has ever reviewed the data. Hint: it’s not the 12 step programs and abstinence-only rehabs you see touted
in most coverage of addiction. Nor is it long-acting naltrexone injections (Vivitrol) 13.

Instead, it’s maintenance14— the long term, indefinite, possibly lifelong use of methadone or
buprenorphine (Suboxone) on an outpatient basis. While now commonly called “medication assisted
treatment,” (MAT), the National Academy of Medicine discourages this wording because it implies that
addiction is not a medical disorder and the medication itself isn’t treatment, which is inaccurate. Data
shows that even without added counseling, methadone and Suboxone by themselves cut the death rate 15.
The National Academy’s review finds that while counseling should be available, requiring it to access
lifesaving medication is inappropriate and may serve as a barrier to care 16.
For pregnant women who are addicted to opioids, maintenance is without question17 the safest and most
effective treatment— withdrawal can actually kill the fetus and the ups and downs of drug levels during
active addiction are much more harmful than exposure to a steady-state dose of maintenance.
5) Do Not Forget Pain Patients:
The pharmaceutical industry underplayed the risk of opioid prescribing by glossing over the fact that most
doctors do not screen patients for addictions. But the reality, according to the New England Journal of
Medicine is that less than 8% of people who are prescribed opioids for chronic pain develop new
addictions18. This means that most people who develop addiction don’t start as pain patients— and most
patients with pain do not become addicted.
Indeed, 80% of people who initiate opioid misuse do not have a prescription: they get their drugs from
friends, family members or medicine cabinets, not doctors19. Most aren’t new to recreational use: at least
two thirds have previously taken cocaine, amphetamine or psychedelics 20.
The result of these misconceptions about risk has been severe cutbacks in the medical supply that have
harmed the pain patients who do benefit from opioids— and a switch in recreational use to heroin, which
these days is typically contaminated with fentanyls, synthetic opioids at least 50 times more powerful than
heroin.
When covering opioids, it is important to include the perspective of these patients— who have become
collateral damage of our drug policy and can often be found in comments sections related to opioid articles,
protesting their lack of inclusion. For fairness sake, include independent voices of pain patients, rather than
those who are associated with patient groups that take pharmaceutical industry funding.
