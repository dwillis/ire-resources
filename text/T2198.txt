Background
• 350 Indian casinos in 30 states. Nationwide, Indian Gaming is a 16.2 billion dollar industry.
• Within four years, experts believe Indian casino revenue will eclipse commercial gaming.
• California, Connecticut, and Minnesota are top three in revenue.
• Tribal casino gross profit margin is 40% of revenue. Commercial 25%.
Membership
•

Membership disputes are more likely to happen in tribes with “per capita” payments, meaning cash
disbursements directly to the members. Divorce records are the best way to establish size of per
capita payment.

•

Federal policy empowers tribe’s to handle internal questions of membership. Rules are usually
outlined in a tribe’s constitution. However, a constitution can be very rudimentary, and written to
benefit those who put in the work to start the tribe… not necessarily for the greater good.

•

Membership disputes can be addressed in tribal courts, but usually benefit tribal leadership. Tribal
courts have a long history of failing to uphold basic human rights, and can be full of conflicts of
interest.

•

Many groups are currently trying to receive federal recognition as tribes. Often this happens by
pairing up with a wealthy investor who pays for the expensive genealogical studies and lobbying
efforts required to establish a new tribe. If successful, these non-Indian investors often fund the
building of the casino operation and receive a substantial cut of the profit.

Regulation
• Tribal gaming revenue is growing and regulation has not kept up. That means Indian gaming is
essentially “self-regulating.”
•

State regulation, for the most part, works on the honor system (Minnesota tribes brought in 1.4 billion
in revenue, but the state budget for regulation is 150,000).

•

Federally, the National Indian Gaming Commission regulates 350 Indian casinos in 30 states with 79
staffers. By comparison New Jersey, with 12 commercial casinos in Atlantic City, has 700 regulatory
employees.

Other Thoughts
• Be respectful of the culture you’re reporting on.
• It’s okay to say “Indian”
• Be patient, it may take “four days”
