It’s hard to get people to care
about poverty.
But everyone—at least most everyone—cares
about how their tax dollars are spent. You
can often tie wasted tax dollars to poverty.
So do it.

SELL YOUR EDITORS & YOUR AUDIENCE

Let’s Practice:
You’re the editor. I’ll pitch 2 stories.
You say which is most appealing to
editors & audience.

SELL YOUR EDITORS & YOUR AUDIENCE

Pitch #1:
From 2005-2010, the Chicago Housing
Authority opened 1,390 court cases
to evict people from public housing.

SELL YOUR EDITORS & YOUR AUDIENCE

Pitch #2:
The Chicago Housing Authority is
evicting hundreds of families under
its one-strike policy for crimes that, in
many cases, leaseholders were never
convicted of.

SELL YOUR EDITORS & YOUR AUDIENCE

Which story won my heart:
#1

or
#2?

SELL YOUR EDITORS & YOUR AUDIENCE

Pitch #2:

SELL YOUR EDITORS & YOUR AUDIENCE

The Chicago Reporter has about
2,000 print subscribers.
Thousands more read online.
So we decided to collaborate to expand the
reach of the story. We had to pitch editors
outside our shop.
As a result…

SELL YOUR EDITORS & YOUR AUDIENCE

This was a story a varying group
of people could relate to:
Why?
•Taxpayer money was being used to evict
people who hadn’t been convicted of a
crime.
•The policy impacted the person’s name
that was on the lease, even if they were
not the one who was arrested. (Any guest
who was arrested could result in the
leaseholder being convicted.)

SELL YOUR EDITORS & YOUR AUDIENCE

The Result:
A working group of Chicago attorneys are
laying the groundwork for a Civil Rights
lawsuits against the Chicago Housing
Authority based on the racial disparity of the
evictions because they were based only on an
arrest.

SELL YOUR EDITORS & YOUR AUDIENCE

Pitch 1:
Poor black people are paying higher interests
for the home loans.

SELL YOUR EDITORS & YOUR AUDIENCE

Chicago earning more than $100,000 a year
were more likely to be offered a high-cost
