Why does good sourcing matter?
• Because journalism, at its heart, is
about people.

• Data and documents are vital, but the
most life-changing stories come down
to people.

The Power of Advanced
Research
• If you are starting cold, do some
research
• Allows you to make a connection
• Makes it harder for them to shut the
door in your face

How does it help me?
• The goal is to discover interesting and important insights about your
potential Source and the place they work or worked.
• You are especially looking for areas where you and the source might have
common ground.
–Did you attend the same schools or church?
–Or know the same group friends or teachers?
–Geek on on the same comic books of fantasy novels
–Watch the same TV Shows.
–Follow the same sports team or league
–Have the same taste in music? Or zeal for hobbies or pets; Have they
experienced a tragedy or hardship that you can relate to?
• This type of information is key for an initial contact or approach

Approaching a Source Cold
• First, you can’t be afraid of the cold call or
the door knock
–Blind call generate best source ever for
Juvenile Series

• Be You.
–Folks smell fake a mile away. That will shut
a source down quick.

•My style - respectful, courteous, inquisitive
about people’s lives, passions and pain.

Gold Standard Move
• The Home Visit

–The gold standard for tough investigations
–Many people feel more comfortable discussing important matters in the
comfort of their home and not in a public spaces where they could been
seen or overhead. They also feel more secure if there isn’t much of a
paper trail connecting each of you.
–Generally evenings during the weekday can be okay. But the best times I’ve
found are early Saturday mornings. Sunday morning too, if you source isn’t a
church goer.
–If the meeting doesn’t happen at home, the real goal here is get face-to-face
with your source.
–Face-to-face is always the best way to conduct a tough interview
•body language
•not letting a source shut down
•tougher for them to run away
•No silent help from someone you can’t see

Why not email? Why Twitter and
Facebook?

• The convenience of the email and social media
messaging is tempting but fraught with peril. Think
about it? If you stole money or raped children, would
you admit it in an email from a stranger? Would you
even respond?
• Sure, on occasion you can use social media or email to
arrange a meeting but its best to avoid doing so
regularly. Among the problems: Some sources will
demand additional details and then become nonresponsive after you share them. Others will forward
your email to their bosses, who then erect internal
obstacles to frustrate your efforts. Worst, some sources
will leak your email to competing news organizations.

conspiracy

sources?

older ones.

another employee, library, or a records
request.

and their kid graduating

have a story
