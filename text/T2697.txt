SFBC International: participants threatened; 325/675 beds removed; US Senate investigates; ; top executives quit;
May 17, 2006: Dade County orders SFBC to demolish Miami test center within 60 days
Background:
Big Pharma subcontracts trials to contract research organizations (CRO's) like SFBC;
FDA subcontracts human subject protection to institutional review boards;
Institutional Review Boards
"IRB"= watchdog for human subjects: Must have at least 5 members: one scientific member, one non-scientific
member, and one member unaffiliated with the institution or group under whose auspices the IRB exists.
SFBC frequently used Southern IRB, owned by SFBC executive's wife
IRB's meet to review proposed clinical trial protocol:
-Balance risk vs reward
-Minimize risk to participants
-Beware: IRB Members with conflicts of interest -Review, require revisions, approve informed consent document
IRB History: (long ago, most trials were overseen by non-profit IRB's; now by for-profit IRB's)
For-profit IRB's: 1. conflict of interest 2. distant from research 3. IRB shopping 4. promise speedy review
Very little transparency (OFTEN SECRET): IRB committee members, meeting minutes, informed consents
Maryland Law provides some transparency (enacted after a Hopkins death) as described in link below
WIRB: largest ethics committee in the world; handles majority of US new drug clinical trials
Big Pharma sends monitors to clinical trial sites (undeterred by "Unsafe Building" signs posted at entrance)

Informed consent:
More than just a piece of paper: the whole process of informing the participant should explain risks
Describes drug or device to be tested, what participant should expect
Participants free to leave the experiment any time
Any payment (usually for healthy volunteers) shouldn't be backloaded (coercing participant not to leave)
Explains the odds of getting placebo or real drug
Is it understandable; in native language of participant (what reading grade level?)
Misc. Tips:
1. Bring Your Own Expert to suspect clinical trial site
2. How to get "inside" a well-secured clinical trial center (find plans at Building Department)
3. How to find clinical trials by company or city (NIH website below)
4. Ask IRB or clinical trial center for copies of all FDA inspections for last five years
5. Use Maryland law to gain access to IRB meeting minutes in that state
6. Read FDA Warning letters to see what can go wrong; search for incidents in your area
