All data in this report is based on FOIA annual
reports filed by the 15 Cabinet level agencies
from Fiscal Years 1998-2006.
 FY 2006 data not yet complete.
 Much of the data entry and analysis was done
by journalism graduate students at American
University, with special thanks to Coral
Davenport and Robin Bravender. This work
could not have been done without them.

Major trends
 Number of requests down
 Backlog rising dramatically
 Fewer requests generate any information
 One in three requests are “non-denial

denials”
 Privacy diminishing as a reason for denial
 “Executive privilege” rising
 Secrecy costs – processing costs higher

The policy
“The effective functioning of our
constitutional democracy depends upon
the participation in public life of a citizenry
that is well informed.”
President George W. Bush’s Executive Order 13392:
“Improving Agency Disclosure of Information”

Policy in action
"The marching orders are now: if there's a
basis to withhold, do it.”
Elizabeth Withnell, chief counsel at the Department of Homeland
Security's Privacy Office, 2006. Interview with Coral Davenport,
American University.

Find the FOIA reports
 Congress requires all agencies to provide

an annual report on FOIA activities

 Due Feb. 1. This year, only 7 of 15 Cabinet

agencies filed by that date
 Web sites are supposed to make it easy to
access reports and other agency FOIA
material
 Here’s an example: Education Department
 One reporter has told me an agency refused a

request for this mandated report

Even Osama has privacy, FBI says

An excerpt from an FBI report on Osama Bin Laden. The report
was done in 2003. A declassified version was obtained via an
FOIA request by Judicial Watch in April, 2005. The blanked out
areas contain Bin Laden’s name and the name of his family.
Meanwhile, the FBI lists Bin Laden as one of its 10 most wanted
and has his picture on the FBI Web site.

But privacy on decline
 In FY ’06, only 39 percent of denials cited

a privacy exemption
 Down from nearly 80 percent in 2001

‘Executive Privilege’ on the rise
Use of Exemption 2 (Internal agency personnel
rules and practices) and Exemption 5 (interagency and intra-agency documents) often
called “pre-decisional” documents on the rise
 From 12 percent in FY01 to 34 percent in FY06
 Most of increase in Homeland Security
 These exemptions give agencies much more
discretion to decide what to withhold.

Appeals can work…sometimes
 Too few appeals filed – only 6,600 in FY

’06 (out of 240,000 denials and non-denial
denials)
 Of those, about 16 percent received some
more data. Most rejections based on “no
records located.”
 But where the agency made a substantive
ruling, 32 percent of requesters got more
information

Congress is watching
 House has approved an updated FOIA
 Senate has introduced a similar bill
 Administration opposes many proposed

changes

Congressional status


House bill passed in March
Restores and reinforces presumption of openness
 Would create “FOIA Ombudsman”
 Reinforces fee waivers for “media” requesters
 Extends coverage to data held by contractors and other private
entities
 Gives requesters more ability to recover attorney’s fees if
information wrongfully withheld
 Improves request tracking system
 Improves data on FOIA processing


House has passed bill
 Republicans/president oppose key provisions
 Similar bill in Senate – not yet to floor
 Veto-proof in House, but likely not in Senate


Increased attention
 News groups and other organizations

increasingly active (including IRE, ASNE)
 More research being done
 Coalition of Journalists for Open Government

 Sunshine Week generating attention

Get involved
Traditionally reluctant as journalists
 Core issue
 Sunshine Week
 Write about denials and successes
 If your state law has monitoring provisions, get
the data and report
 Do an access audit


 State
 Local
 Federal (regional offices, etc.)
