Trump Entertainment Resorts, Form 14a, 2012

SEC - Trump’s Castle Funding
Form S-4/A, May 6, 1994
“Trump has a substantial amount of personal indebtedness, most of which will
become due in June 1995. The total amount of such indebtedness will depend on
a number of factors…”
“There can be no assurance that Trump will be successful in repaying or
rescheduling his indebtedness, which events may be beyond the control of Trump.
Any failure by Trump to repay or reschedule his indebtedness...could adversely
affect the Partnership's ability to provide for the payment of interest or principal on
the Senior Notes.”

Objection to Trump Casino Bankruptcy Plan
“The Trump name does not connote high-quality amenities and first-class service
in the casino industry. Rather, the Trump name is associated with four bankruptcy
cases, three failed plans of reorganization, the failure to pay one's debts, a
company that has lost money every year, and properties in need of significant
deferred maintenance and lagging behind their competitors.”
-- Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, the investment banking firm that Mr. Trump
shorted, in the casino’s 2004 bankruptcy case
