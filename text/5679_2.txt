_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

Nine places to start an investigation:
1) Athletes & Crime

a. What percentage of athletes on your local college or pro team has been involved in crimes?
What type? Did they result in charges? Did they end in convictions? How does that compare to
what happens to a similar subset of male suspects? Are there patterns in the narratives?
b. How are coaches, teams, schools responding to criminal behavior?
c. What are teams/schools doing to be proactive about preventing crime among athletes?
d. Sentences served by athletes – Many are sentenced to community service, but what do they
actually do? (ie signing autographs, throwing out ceremonial baseball pitch…or picking up trash)
e. Are athletes victims of crimes? (Fraud, theft, extortion, etc.) Theft involving athletes is
underreported.
f. Local, state & national criminal case searches are first step in researching a case, but:
i. Athletes often go by initials, middle names or nicknames on rosters. Make sure you have
the athlete’s full legal name before doing a search.
ii. Athletes are more likely than non-athletes to have legal counsel even for minor crimes.
iii. Athletes/coaches may have more incentive to get crimes sealed/expunged. So make
sure you include a search of local media for reports of crimes whose case files might
now be expunged. Bail bondsmen & jail incarceration records are also good sources.
iv. Make sure you check courts AND ALSO local law enforcement for cases that did not
result in charges - especially important in sexual assault/domestic violence incidents.
g. Set up social media monitors for all athlete, fan blog & campus newspapers. Often crime news
breaks there first. Grab social media chatter regarding a crime ASAP b/c it often gets deleted.
h. Develop relationships with the attorneys who most often represent athletes. Every team –
college & pro – has a liaison to the police dept. For local reporters, building a relationship w/that
person or another assistant/staffer is key on staying on top of reported crimes.
i. Some good efforts at logging athlete crimes:
i. USA TODAY athlete arrest database
ii. Arrest Nation: the sports arrest database
j. Note: Making comparisons across jurisdictions is tricky because public records, expungement,
local law enforcement/prosecutor bias, & community standards can influence how many crime
reports you can get your hands on. Comparing within a state is a much better barometer.

2) Campus cops

a. Crimes referred to student judicial affairs instead of local prosecutors?
b. Denied by FERPA? Doesn’t apply to criminal records.
Good reference National Association of College and University Attorneys but most of the FERPA
and other stuff is behind a paywall.
c. Private college PDs subject to public records laws in TX, VA, OH, GA, & NC; are yours?

3) Campus Sexual Assault & Title IX

a. Understanding Title IX & enforcement (from USDOE public affairs’ Jim Bradshaw):
i. OCR’s April 2014 sexual violence guidance.
ii. OCR’s April 2011 Dear Colleague Letter addressing sexual violence on campus.
iii. Guidance on Title IX coordinators.
iv. Title IX “Reading Room.”
v. Frequently asked questions about sex discrimination.
vi. NotAlone.gov with help for students and schools.
vii. For information on how OCR handles civil rights complaints, go here.
b. Track complaints via Chronicle of Higher Education (which has email updates).
c. FERPA can restrict your access to the name of other students (incl. victims/witnesses, without
written consent of those students). But if alleged perpetrator in a disciplinary proceeding
related to a crime of violence or non-forcible sex offense is found to have violated school’s rules
or policies, you can get his/her name, violation committed, & any sanctions.
d. Title IX lawsuits are typically filed in federal court (www.pacer.gov). The “Nature of Suit” code is
often 440 or 448. Also look for lawsuits from expelled or disciplined students for unjust removal.
e. Examples: ESPN Outside the Lines on sexual assault at Baylor and the University of Missouri.

4) College Athletics Finance 101

a. NCAA budget database: Education Department’s EADA (Equity in Athletic Disclosure Act) [Note:
Don’t use this unless you have to; it’s not accurate but it does give some understanding of
private school spending]
b. Better: FOIA revenue-and-expense statements each university submits to NCAA each January. A
limited version of those statements are published annually at USA TODAY.
Story tips/ideas
c. Big salaries? Big buyouts? Big administrator pay?
d. Check budget - How many ppl needed to recruit a player? Costs growing? Any other big surges?
e. Knight Commission’s Athletic & Academic Spending Database: athletics vs. academics spending
f. How much are student fees propping up big athletics budgets? Talk to student government
leaders (past & present) and former university administrators. Get meeting minutes & athletic
requests from student fee committees. Example: WTSP story on USF budget.
g. Contracts! Every employment or service arrangement has paper trail. And with a few exceptions,
these deals change all the time. Contracts with coaches & administrators; shoe-and-apparel
companies; radio/TV/marketing; ticket/suite sales & fundraising providers, search firms, etc.
h. Have U.S. tax changes impacted revenues? Ticket deductions and booster donations lose tax
exemptions; 21% excise tax on compensation above $1 million for the school’s five most highly
compensated employees.
i. Impacts from rules changes recommended by the Commission on College Basketball (a.k.a., the
Rice Commission). These include changes in the NCAA enforcement/penalty structure and
schools or the NCAA committing to pay for the degree completion of scholarship athletes who
leave school after making at least two years’ progress towards a degree.
j. NCAA transfer rules are changing to loosen restrictions on football & basketball players
k. NCAA recruiting rule changes related to when athletes in sports other than football and
basketball can make visits to schools and when recruiting conversations at camps or clinics can
begin. Visits can now begin as early as Sept. 1 of a recruit’s junior year.
l. Court cases pertaining to concussions and the NCAA’s amateurism rules.

5) Fan Rights & Safety

a. Food and beverage
i. Look through health department inspection reports for stadium vendors & athlete food
caterers for critical violations, what kind of violations, repeat offenders, and what’s
being done. Get copies of official – and social media - complaints from fans about food.
ii. Check alcohol citations & DUIs. Get copies of vendor serving rules. Are they enforced
both in and out of the stadium? If not, has that created problems?
iii. Examples: Outside the Lines takes deep (and icky) dive into contaminated food at sports
venues in 2010 and exposes questionable food safety during the World Series in 2015.
b. Americans with Disabilities Act
i. Get ADA complaints from local and federal authorities. (Complaints can be filed here:
https://www.ada.gov/filing_complaint.htm) The U.S. Dept. of Justice enforces ADA.
[Note: you may see a lot of lawsuits filed against universities that have to do with
website access, not physical access]
ii. Check for ADA lawsuits against sports venues.
iii. Check with local disability rights groups, including veterans’ associations.
c. Fan injuries
i. Check baseball stadiums (or other sports with flying debris, incl. NASCAR). Also, fanover-railing problems. Check for police reports/lawsuits.
ii. Fan-on-fan violence. Beyond the police reports, request text messages sent to stadium
security during games, now that many venues have text message reporting systems.

6) Academic Fraud – Happening More & Penalized Less
a. If coaches or athletic department workers are not involved, it’s almost never an NCAA violation
b. Get aggregate data comparing standardized test scores of football/basketball players to rest of
student population (Example: Mike Knobler’s excellent AJC investigation)
c. NCAA data on API.
d. Get breakdown of online vs. traditional classes for big money sports & how it’s changed (ie
Oregon)
e. Get aggregate academic misconduct violations among regular students vs. athletes; request
information on type of cheating activity & penalties students faced.
Examples: Reuters Chinese student cheating investigation and WSJ int’l student cheating survey
f. Get correspondence between athletic academic advisers & athletics compliance officials (start
w/football & men’s basketball advisers & counselors), and/or correspondence between coaches
& academic advisers or faculty members (former Rutgers coach Kyle Flood: “I am sending it from
my personal email to ensure there will be no public vetting of the correspondence”)
g. Examine the path football players take from high school to college, particularly NCAA “nonqualifiers” and junior-college transfers who don’t stick around long
h. Write about the increasing use of the “academic gap year,” when marginal students can make
miraculous academic recoveries & how players use it to gain NCAA eligibility
i. Investigate prep schools’ shady academic credentials & ties between college coaches and ACT
testing sites
j. Talk to academic advisers at community colleges that serve as big feeders to big athletic depts
k. Track down former academic advisers for major-college athletic departments, particularly ones
who have left the profession
l. Search the UNC data trove, including appendices (thanks WRAL.com & your #UNCdocs work)
m. Study the Southern Miss case file
n. Search “academic misconduct” in NCAA infractions database & why it’s increasing (metadata)

7) The Never-Ending Chase for Stadium Subsidies
a. Step 1 - build leverage: Peter Gammons on MLB “blackmailing” cities
b. READ contracts carefully for fine print! Example: Tampa Bay Buccaneers only get richer

i. FOIA: drafts of contracts
ii. Public venue; but does team keep naming rights, ad revenues, ticket taxes, etc? What
about revenue from non-sporting events?
iii. Discounted rent? Parking concessions?
iv. Tax breaks? Land giveaways? Ex: 14 sneaky ways taxpayers could pay for Rays stadium
v. Fatal “state-of-the-art clause?” Ex: VICE Sports & $187M D-Backs demands
vi. How long is lease? Cities should always expect to pay significant amounts to keep teams
when contracts are up.
c. It’s not about attendance; it’s about capturing more revenue
i. Pro teams aren’t just sports businesses anymore; they’re real estate businesses now –
how much development are they building, and how much entertainment money will
they draw from competing local businesses?
1. FOIA: LLC records, property records
2. FOIA: emails to elected officials, gov’t real estate departments
3. FOIA: bond capacity studies, site consultant reports & studies
ii. Tix prices WILL soar: “Teams want your $$ so they can rip out seats & charge you more”
iii. FOIA: subsidy applications – they sometimes give you peak into financials or biz plans

8) Economic Impact Fallacies

a. Never believe the report! Ex: Florida's leading economist on sporting events isn't an economist
b. FOIA: the actual study
i. Who paid for it?
ii. Did the study neglect opportunity cost or the substitution/cannibalization effect?
Ex: 4-year-old helps school politicians on economic impact reports
iii. Where is economic impact really going? Local? Or large chains in other cities?
c. Contact author, local academics/economists
d. REMEMBER: pro sports are retail businesses
e. How real are those “heads in beds?”
Ex: Numbers don't support college football playoff economic boom
f. Examples: Rays, Braves, Yankees spring training “studies”; Vocative on Spring Training

9) Politicians Love Stadiums!
a.
b.
c.
d.

FOIA: Emails & texts (don’t forget personal accounts/devices)
FOIA: comp tickets & suite attendees at public/university facilities
FOIA: gift disclosures
The “new stadium will bring new events to town all year long” claim
i. FOIA: Does your city have demonstrated need for new sports or entertainment venues?
ii. FOIA: How full are other major (publicly-run) sports, concert, & event venues?
iii. SOURCE: Competing venues – is there a need, or will new facility cannibalize biz?
iv. Resource: What kind of cities are stadium subsidies right for?
e. For every winner, there is a loser - what are your community’s other needs?
i. Example: Tampa Bay, Atlanta, Cincinnati, Glendale, Hartford
ii. SOURCE: Don’t forget the human element of whom the decisions will impact
f. Advice for politicians (and your audience) when considering stadiums
