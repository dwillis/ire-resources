Open Records In Mississippi
gregg.mayer@phelps.com

Open Records Act
• Miss. Code Ann. § 25-61-1, et. seq.
• Anybody can request records
• Requester’s purpose for records does not
affect requester’s right to receive records
• All three branches of government are
covered by the Act
• But several exemptions apply

What Is A “Public Record”
• Includes “all books, records, papers, accounts, letters,
maps, photographs, films, cards, tapes, recording or
reproductions thereof, and any other documentary
materials, regardless of physical form or characteristics,
having been used, being in use, or prepared, possessed,
or retained for use in the conduct, transaction or
performance of any business, transaction, work, duty or
function of any public body, or required to be maintained
by any public body.” § 25-61-3(b)

Three Elements To Be A
Public Record
• Documentary material
• Used by a public body
• In the conduct, transaction or performance of
any business…of the public body
– Work-related email messages and attachments are public
records under Mississippi law
– Can include records (emails) on home computers, cell phones,
tablets of public employees
– Does not include purely personal records

What Is A Public Body
• “any department, bureau, division, council,
commission, committee, subcommittee,
board, agency and any other entity of the
state or a political subdivision thereof, and
any municipal corporation and any other
entity created by the Constitution or by
law, executive order, ordinance or
resolution.” - §25-61-3(a)
– Not necessarily Legislature - § 25-61-17

How Do You Get Records
• First, just ask the person
– Quickest and cheapest way to get records

• If required, file a written request with the
public body

• Public body must provide “reasonable
access” to public records

Making A Written Request
• State this is a request to inspect and/or copy public
records pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. § 25-61-1, et. seq.
• Be specific
• Ask For Records, Not For The Public Body To Compile
Information For You
• Ask for a copy of open-records policy
» Supposed to be published already
» If NO POLICY, must produce within one working day

• Ask for a copy of internal appeal policy (in case records
request is initially denied)
• Ask for a copy(ies) of records retention policy(ies)

Making A Written Request
• Ask public body to identify what statutory
exemptions, if any, it relies upon to
withhold an otherwise public record
• Ask for cost estimate over certain
threshold
• Ask to inspect instead of copying to save
$$$$

Time To Respond
• Written request establishes time to
respond
• Public body generally has seven (7) days
to respond (if it has a policy)
• Public body can take up to fourteen (14)
days if more time is needed

So What Can You Get?
•
•
•
•

Budgets
Contracts
Elections records
Gross salary of public
employees
• Incident reports from
police
• Emails
• Jail docket

• 911 tapes
• Mug shots (if classified as
part of the “identification”
of the person charged)
• Public utility records
(except to the extent

Record Retention
• Mississippi Dep’t Of Archives Publishes
An Entire List Of Record Retention
Guidelines For Cities, Counties, Etc.
– http://www.mdah.ms.gov/new/government2/records-management/local-governmentrecords/
• E.g., contracts must be kept a minimum five (5)
years after expiration

Roadblock – Fees
• Public bodies may “establish and collect
fees reasonably calculated to reimburse it
for…the actual cost of searching,
reviewing and/or duplicating and, if
applicable, mailing copies of public
records.”
• May collect in advance

“Actual Costs”
• Ethics Commission considers 15-centsper-page for standard copies to be
reasonable (Op. R-16-007)
– More than that, public body will have to justify
it
– 15 cents should include the time/labor
retrieving and copying
– Some fees are set by statute (chancery court)

Roadblock - Exemptions
• Academic records
• Documents subpoenaed
by AG when he is
investigating crime
• Records developed
among judges, aides
• Social Security,
telephone numbers and
dates of birth from voter
registration
• Proprietary and
confidential information

• Personnel records (not
include names and gross
salary)
• Records of executive
sessions
• Investigative reports
• Appraisal information
• Autopsy reports
• Archaeological site, if
disclosure risks damage

Redacting Exemptions
• Public body cannot withhold record
because part of it is exempt
• Must redact the exempted material and
make the non-exempted material available
for examination - §25-61-7(2)

Default Rule On Disclosure
“Any doubt about whether records should be
disclosed should be resolved in favor of
disclosure.”
-Harrison County Development Comm’n v. Kinney, 920
So.2d 497, 502 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006)

Incident Report v.
Investigative Report
• Incident report at a minimum has:
– name and identification of each person
charged with and arrested for the alleged
offense
– the time, date and location of the alleged
offense
– and the property involved, to the extent the
information is known.
§ 25-61-3

Incident Report v.
Investigative Report
• Nothing in the Act requires a public body to create a
document labeled “incident report” but it is clear from the
Act that the contents of a document determine whether it
is an incident report.
• If only report contains investigative information, public
body must redact and produce non-exempt information
that would be in an incident report (Ethics Comm’n
Opinion No. R-10-020)

Exempt or Not
• City hires consultant to review police
department
– Consultant prepares written report
– Report identifies issues with department’s
building, such as inadequate or no locks, poor
lighting, faulty electrical systems
– Report includes recommendations to fix

Exempt or Not
• (f) "Investigative report" means records of
a law enforcement agency:
– would prematurely release information that
would impede the public body's enforcement,
investigative or detection efforts
– would endanger the life or safety of a public
official or law enforcement personnel
– Records pertaining to quality control
§ 25-61-3

Confidential and Proprietary
• Records furnished to public bodies by third
parties which contain trade secrets or
confidential commercial or financial
information – §25-61-9
• Records are released no later than 21
days from the date the third parties are
given notice …unless the third parties
have filed in chancery court a petition
seeking a protective order

What Is “Confidential”?
• One argument: disclosure could lead to
competitive disadvantage
– Disclose customer list to competitors
– Disclose strategic product development

• Also includes commercial/financial records
“required” to be provided to public body
• No single test – case-by-case

Denial of Request – Let’s Fight!
• Denial Of Request Must Be In Writing
• Must state basis for denial
• “Overbroad” – not a basis
• “Not identifiable” – is a basis
• Exempt – is a basis

Must Be “Identifiable” Record
• For example, asking “what policies” a public body has for
handling discrimination complaints is merely a request
for “information.” See Public Records Case No. R-10003.
• An “identifiable record” is not a request for “information”
in general nor is it a request that a public body review its
files and answer questions posed by a requestor. See
Public Records Case Nos. R-15-041; R-15-026; R-14034; and R-14-001.

Deny Or Not
• Copy of original historical narrative with required
paperwork submitted by County to Mississippi
Department of Archives and History
• Yearly amount of all funding received from County’s
taxpayers
• Date, place, and time of meeting of airport authority
when claim was denied
