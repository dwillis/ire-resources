What is RSS?
RSS is a syndication format for delivering content over the Web. Text, pictures, audio,
video, whatever. It’s all enclosed in XML. That means you can turn it into data. Or you
can scrape HTML or other formats into RSS to push it out to the newsroom.

Learning About RSS
Technical definition: http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss
(pay attention to required elements)

Turning RSS into Data
I recommend Feed Parser, a Python module: http://feedparser.org/
Feed Parser turns RSS elements into Python objects, which can be inserted into SQL
databases. Other choices:

Perl: http://www.petercooper.co.uk/archives/000995.html
Perl: http://tageloehner.de/rss2sql.pl.txt
PHP: http://kynikeren.com/tech/category/feedparser/
