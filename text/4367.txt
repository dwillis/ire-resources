Some basic questions
• What type of study?
They are not all created equal

• Was it peer-reviewed?
If “yes,” be wary; if “no,” be very wary
• Who paid for the work to be done?
Studies have shown that it can make a difference to the
reported findings

What type of study?
Confidence in
the findings
• Observational
• Experimental

• Double-blind, randomized controlled trial
(RCT)
• Systematic review/meta-analysis of RCTs

Was it peer reviewed?
“We portray peer review to the public as a quasi-sacred
process that helps to make science our most objective truth
teller. But we know that the system of peer review is biased,
unjust, unaccountable, incomplete, easily fixed, often insulting,
usually ignorant, occasionally foolish, and frequently wrong.”
Richard Horton, editor-in-chief, The Lancet

Who paid for the work to be done?

More questions
• What was actually measured?
Deaths from heart attack, or levels of “bad” cholesterol?
(Also beware “mice cured” stories)
• How large, and how long?
Beware of small studies with short duration
• Was the main finding statistically significant?
The bar in many disciplines is low

• How big was the effect?
Or: How significant is this in the real world? You may
need help with this …

Questions for your expert sources
• Do the results justify the conclusions?
Or is there an alternative explanation?

• Was the analysis performed correctly?
Ask about flaws in statistical analysis or in the design of the
study
• How does this result fit with those from other
studies?
• How big is this effect?
Get them to help you put measures like “odds ratio,”
“relative risk” and “number needed to treat” into phrases
that everyone can understand.
(And don’t forget to ask all sources about their financial and other conflicts)
