 How many people died after being Tasered by

police?

 Where to get data
 What to do with the data
 Look for patterns

 FOIAs

 FBI/Bureau of Justice Statistics
 Officer Down Memorial Page
 National Tracing Center

 Police Departments
 Court records

 Violence Policy Center

 State and Local Prosecutors

 State Law Enforcement Agency Investigations
 Autopsy reports

How this document helped me trace guns

 Create an Excel spreadsheet
 Enter the data
 Sort by categories (crime, type of gun, etc.)



The two deadliest situations for cops are traffic
stops and domestic disputes.
More than 200 of the shooters were felons, who,
under law, are prohibited from possessing
firearms.
Handguns were used to kill 365 officers; rifles
and shotguns were used to kill 140 officers.

 511 cops were killed by guns during a 10-

year period.

 I was able to track how the suspects obtained

their weapons in 341 deaths.

 Legal purchase was the leading source of

weapons used to kill cops (107 times)

 Stolen guns turned up in 77 deaths.



The median age of a shooter was 27, younger
than the population at large.
The median age of the slain cops was 36,
matching the country’s.
Forty-two of the killers were 18 or younger,
including four 15 year olds.
The oldest shooter was 77.

 At least 19 witnesses didn’t receive protection,

including a confidential informant working for the
DEA.

 At least five were killed after defense lawyers

learned their names and told their clients.

 In at least four cases, charges against a defendant

were dropped after the witness was killed.





At least 48 people died in the United States between January and
October-about one death a week — in incidents in which police
used Tasers.
Twelve of the 26 cases in which The Post was able to obtain
autopsy reports or cause-of-death information mentioned a
Taser along with other factors in terms of cause of death.



More than half of the 48 suffered from mental illness or had
illegal drugs in their system at the time.



At least 10 were Tasered while handcuffed or shackled. Only one
was female.



Nearly 55 percent of the people who died were minorities.



Only one case resulted in officers being indicted.

 It’s important to stay organized when doing a

data-driven project. It helps when it’s time to
write.

 Think multimedia when reporting a project.

It’s no longer about text and photos.
Graphics, video and interactive databases
play a crucial role.
