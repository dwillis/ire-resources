So……
Do we request only the DATA? Do we request the METADATA?
• Code schema for entire
• A statement of the
file, not just specific fields
rationale and laws
• Blank data collection
• A subject
paper forms (if used)
• Contact information
• Shots of data entry
screen(s)
• Depending on your
request, you may also need • Description of software
and versions used to enter
to include an argument for
data
release and/or supporting
• Software training manuals
documents and
information
• All emails related to
training AND THEIR
• Request fee waiver.

Challenges/problems with metadata requests
• Laws vary – federal, state, local jurisdictions
• Multiple exemptions
• Agencies often/usually not required to…
– create new data or reports
– Produce drafts or “working papers”

• Agencies only deliver PDFs
– Claim equipment can only produce PDFs
– Claim PDFs are used to prevent modification of data

• Data Huggers -7

Request for NM prison medication data

Please note: I am NOT seeking
any information related to
individuals in custody.

8

• Actual size of 101 pages on 8.5x11 page
• Third column is “patient name” redacted
by printing out PDF, laying a strip of paper
down the patient’s name column,
rescanning and saving as PDF

• Many pages cockeyed on printout
• Essentially, totally useless. Impossible to
scan and extract data at a reasonable cost
• Why? Passive-aggressive behavior
against these damn journalists?
Incompetence in terms of software mgmt
skills? ¿Quién sabe?
9

Request for NM prison medication data
• Obviously has problems:
– Can’t extract data, ergo useless
data/document

• OK. Let’s try to find out how the database
works: Both products and process
– PDF surely originated by either a DB program
or entered into Excel or someone filled in a
form
– Can a report be generated with named person
field redacted? Most likely.

• We turn to metadata request
10

Refiled request
1. Please supply copies of any contracts,
purchase orders or letters of understanding
with vendors related to the purchase,
installation and training of the data base and
spreadsheet program(s) used to account for the
purchases of all inmate medication, pharmacy
costs and back up pharmacy costs used by the
Department of Corrections.

2. Please supply the documents describing
and/or naming the digital files used and
saved when entering the data pertaining to
the costs referenced in #1 above.

11

Back to the well for metadata
• Why? If we know what program(s) are being
used to enter the data we can possibly
determine what types of reports can be
generated
• Also looking for training protocols for hints
about what the DB administrators or clerks
“should” know
• Asking for emails and their attachments and
calendars of training.
12

1. What are the names and versions of the data base and
spreadsheet program(s) used to account for the purchases of all
inmate medication, pharmacy costs and back up pharmacy costs
used by the Department of Corrections.
2. Please supply copies of any contracts or purchase orders with
vendors related to the installation of the programs referenced in #1
above.
3. Please supply the names of the digital files used and saved when
entering the data pertaining to the costs referenced in #1.
4. Please supply the code sheets (sometimes called the “code
schema” or “meta data”) describing all of the fields and defining the
variables, i.e. headers of the columns and/or rows, used when
entering the data in this record system. (I pledge not to use external
data to attempt to identify specific patients.)
13

5. Please supply any flowcharts and instructions describing data
entry, data analysis and production of reports related to these
records along with the coding for any and all variables that are not
specifically included in the metadata, e.g. SPSS logfiles, SQL
programs, key fields specified, etc.
6. Please supply copies of the materials used when training the dataentry and analytic personnel. (These would typically include ink-onpaper materials for in-class or self-study, video tutorials or URL links
to such tutorials, PowerPoint presentations, etc.)
7. Please provide copies of all email and scheduling calendars related
to training personnel in the use of the above programs.

8. Please supply copies any reports reflecting your department’s
analysis of the data described in #1 above.

What we received
• We have unusable PDFs of spreadsheets
• We get copy of contract with what was called
Corrections Corporation of America and
Corizon Health Inc. [Also tied to MHM Services, Inc. or
sometimes, CoreCivic. See also Muckrock: “This is why private prisons
shouldn’t control access to their records”]

21

Some takeaways
• Consider the size and professionalism of the
agency.
• Ask to look at the record layouts in person.
• Understand that you will have to ask follow-up
questions no matter what you get.
• Emphasize early and often that the
documentation helps make requests more
efficient.
• Do your legislators understand these issues?
They should.

Transparency by design -- a dream
1. Data can be exported to a non-proprietary,
open format.
2. This functionality should be built in and not
require programming.
3. The vendor should make it simple for the
public body to redact.
4. The vendor will provide a detailed description
of all tables and fields in the database that will
be a public record, not subject to the
exemptions for trade secrets or copyright
protections.

• Look for databases of databases
• GIS files
• Even old ones can help you know what is
being collected
• Read the specs of ‘proprietary’ programs. This
can help you learn not only what is collected,
but how easy it may be to export.
• Look for reports. This will tell you what is
collected
NICAR17 – March 2017 – Jacksonville, Florida

25

• Look at other places. If another place with
easier access has similar data, you can learn
how things are collected
• Follow the data trail. Local > County >
Regional > State > Federal
• See if you can create your own version.
• Data entry, surveys, reader feedback

Discussion
• Building FOIA strategies
• Best practices?
– Laws vary by jurisdiction
– Wordsmithing the request
– File type specifics
– Appeals
– Suits – by institution or individual

“Data Hugging!”
• “It’s held separately by N different
organizations and we can’t join it
up.”
• “It will make people angry and
scared without helping them.”
• “It is technically impossible.”
• “We do not own the data.”
• “The data is just too large to be
published and used.”
• “Our website cannot hold files this
large.”
• “We know the data is wrong.”
• “We know the data is wrong, and
people will tell us where it is
wrong.”

• “We know the data is wrong, and
we will waste valuable resources
inputting the corrections people
send us.”
• “People will draw superficial
conclusions from the data without
understanding the wider picture.”
• “People will construct [football]
league tables from it.” [?]
• “It will generate more Freedom of
Information requests.”
• “It might be combined with other
data to identify individuals/
sensitive information.”
• “It will cost too much to put it into
a standard format.”
• “Our IT suppliers will charge us a
fortune to do an ad hoc extract.”

How MuckRock Works
MuckRock helps anyone file, track and share public
records requests, using a mix of software and handson help to make the process as easy and transparent
as possible.
Originally made possible by a grant from the Sunlight
Foundation, the service is now funded primarily by its
users, including journalists, researchers, activists, and
people who just want to better understand what their
government is up to.

Value of Getting Vendor Contracts
• Named parties
– Contacts for interviews; insights

• Definitions
– Sometimes similar to the field names in reports,
Excel or TK

• Also see original RFPs for insights into what
the required data might be
