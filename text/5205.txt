Watchdogging Weed
Amanda Chicago Lewis,
Rolling Stone columnist

A liBle about me & my work:
- Covering the cannabis industry for the past
four years, based in the biggest market in the
world: Los Angeles
- Focusing on public safety, the inﬂuence of
special interests, and the ways the
documented racial dispari@es of the war on
drugs are con@nuing under legaliza@on

Why should you take pot seriously?
- Marijuana is the second most valuable crop
in the United States ($40-50 billion a year) –
second only to corn (~$53 billion)
- Marijuana is the most common reason for
arrest in the country (about 700,000 arrests a
year)
- There is very li8le oversight, and it is oRen
diﬃcult to sort marijuana fact from marijuana
ﬁc@on à journalists are badly needed

Obstacles to Repor<ng on the
Marijuana Industry
• very few reliable sources
– Even lawyers, tes@ng labs, companies that publish
industry data and other seemingly unbiased
sources oRen have undisclosed conﬂicts of
interest / are using bogus methods
– Very liBle medical research in humans, unreliable
government data
– Conﬂic@ng data
• Gateway drug vs not a gateway drug
• Causing cancer vs curing cancer

More obstacles

• A lot of media coverage of marijuana is
– from ac@vists (not interested in cri@cizing industry),
– from people who do both PR & journalism,
– based solely on press releases,
– from people who live in NY and don’t understand how
things are working on the ground on the west coast

• Regula@ons are very complicated, and very
localized
– Changes based on city/county

The Grey Market
***THERE IS OFTEN NO LEGAL / ILLEGAL BINARY***

• In California, Michigan, Canada, and a few
other places, marijuana is legal to possess but
not formally regulated. This means that
almost all businesses are opera@ng in a grey
area
– Can be harder to ﬁnd people to speak on the
record.

• Similarly, all business is done in cash (banks
are regulated and insured under federal law)
– Harder to “follow the money”

Breakdown of a marijuana industry
inves@ga@on: “Is Hash Oil Safe?”

Origin story
• Los Angeles, February, 2013
– What is “wax”??
– Story not published un@l April 2015

Here’s what I learned:
• It’s just guys in their
basements releasing cans of
lighter ﬂuid over the lowest
possible quality pot – the
stuﬀ they couldn’t sell
otherwise because mold,
mites, mildew, or because
too weak (trim = leaves and
stems)

In person / on background
conversa@ons at social events
• So much involving how the industry operates is
obscured / vaguely criminal / described in
euphemis@c terms
• To understand what “wax” was, I spoke with
dozens of people before I knew enough to even
ask the correct ques@ons.
• Again, being a cannabis user helped create trust
• I get almost all of my stories through in-person
repor@ng

• No research into how this stuﬀ was aﬀec@ng
human health, but dispensary owners in CA
believe hash oil cons@tutes about 30-40% of
the state market (!!)
• Making the stuﬀ can cause ﬁres / explosions

What should you be paying more
a8en<on to in your state’s marijuana
industry?
• Pes@cide use
• Cronyism in licensing
• Felony exclusions and racial equity

Pes@cides
This isn’t like organic apples vs. regular apples.
We’re talking about pes@cides that are typically used on
ornamental plants.
They contain known neurotoxins and carcinogens.
Key products:
Eagle 20 (myclobutanil)
Floramite (bifenezate)
Talstar (bifenthrin)

• NBC Los Angeles found in February that over
90% of the products they purchased at
random Los Angeles dispensaries contained
harmful pes@cides

• They used Oregon’s regula@ons as a guide –
the strictest in the na@on.

What to do:
• Check for pes@cide regula@ons in your state
• Buy cannabis products
• Bring to trusted, *non-cannabis* tes@ng lab

Cronyism!
• In most places, cannabis business licenses are
limited in number
• Licenses are chosen by (typically unelected)
commissions, and their delibera@ons are oRen
not public record
– This can happen at the state level or at the local level

• The people who receive licenses are oRen local
plutocrats with connec@ons to law enforcement,
poli@cians, etc.

What to do:
• Obtain score sheets from licensing commissions
via public record (if possible)
– In Washington DC, lawsuit made this public record à
this is doable
– Some@mes even if these aren’t public record, certain
par@cipants will have copies / can leak

• Observe mee@ngs where licensing gets decided
• Determine whether people with highest scores
were the same as the people who received
licenses

Racial Equity
• In every county in America, black people are
between two and ten @mes more likely than
white people to get arrested for marijuana
crimes
• Black people and white people use and sell drugs
at about the same rates
• Almost everywhere with legal marijuana, you
cannot par@cipate in the industry if you have a
drug felony (and some@mes a drug
misdemeanor)

As a result…
• White people with decades of experience growing
or selling pot (dispropor@onately no criminal
records) are doing very well in legal weed
• Black people with same are being excluded
• Drug felony and misdemeanor exclusions are
fundamentally racially biased, based on
documented racial dispari@es of the war on drugs

What to do
• Examine the racial breakdown of the industry in
your state – oRen this simply means calling /
visi@ng every business you can, as this data isn’t
tracked in most places
• Call aBen@on to drug felony exclusions during
licensing process / as regula@ons are being
ﬁnalized
• Be mindful of cons@tu@onal complica@ons
around aBempts to give minori@es a leg up
during the licensing process
