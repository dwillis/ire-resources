Multiplatform Storytelling Tips
for Reporter-Editor Teams
Early Storytelling Decisions
x

Find your focus: Identify a strong and unique angle for reporting the project, then make sure that all
later storytelling maintains the focus on that angle.

x

Discuss a general storytelling framework: Based on early reporting and emerging story lines, should the
project be one big story? A multi-part series that is published on consecutive days? A rolling
investigation that is published periodically? Making this decision early helps focus reporting to ensure
that the right building blocks are gathered efficiently. If there are multiple parts, make sure each one
tells a new story that doesn’t feel repetitive in content or approach.

x

Consider the best storytelling platform(s): Think big and creatively about what is the best way to tell the
story: Text-based storytelling? Video? Audio? Interactives? Graphics? Then look for ways to get the
resources to do it (or at least as much of it as you can).

Tips for Reporters
x

Keep a spreadsheet to make writing easier: As you’re reporting, jot down great findings, interesting
tidbits and telling examples in a spreadsheet that is coded by themes. It will help you outline your story
later. Include a field to help you remember where you’ve filed that material.

x

Write the video script first: It forces you to focus your storytelling on the most important elements. If
possible, shoot your own video and take ownership of finding creative visuals. If you don’t have the
images, your video storytelling ability will be limited.

x

Think about the whole package: Discuss with your editor(s) all the elements in the project before
beginning to write. Can some information become part of a chart or interactive to clear clutter out of the
narrative? If so, are we leaving enough examples in the main story so that it stands on its own?

Tips for Editors
x

Help your reporters reach for higher level findings that are truly groundbreaking; don’t settle for where
reports, studies, or where government regulators have already gone.

x

Explore all storytelling options and push for a cutting-edge approach. Use a long-form page
presentation and develop data-driven interactives, motion graphics or other visuals to bring the story to
life.

x

Organize the “team” that will develop the visuals (video, graphics database/developers, design) – and
do so EARLY in the process. Hold weekly check-in meetings to share status updates and keep
everything on track. Pinpoint a “completion” date a week prior to publication and work against that. Hold
everyone accountable but try to keep it fun and inspirational.

The Curious Incident of the Dog in
