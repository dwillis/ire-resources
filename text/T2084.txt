Sports Investigations
Revealing trends:
Some of the best stories are hidden because it requires pulling information together from
disparate sources — a task that is often too time-consuming for the time-strapped reporter. But if
you suspect there’s a good story out there, it’s worth the time.
Tips for making it easier:
• Do the information or data collection over an extended period of time, so you can do a
small amount each week or each day.
• Set up a database or some system for collecting the information/data so it doesn’t require
extra work later. Putting the information into a database is usually the best route. Then
it’s in a sort-able, organized format right from the start.
• Keep a detailed record of what you’ve done (and what’s left to do) so that you don’t
waste time trying to remember where you left off.

High School Ideas:
•Gender equity
•Athletic expenses and revenues (including booster club donations)
•Participation rates

College Ideas:
•Expense accounts for coaches and teams (especially recruiting)
•Special assistance fund
•Student fees for athletics

Data sources:
High school participation surveys: Your state high school association surveys its member
schools every year and that information is sent on to the National Federation of State High School
Associations, http://www.nfhs.org/
Information is at summary level — total number of girls statewide playing soccer, for example.
This survey covers about 90% of U.S. public and private high schools. Surveys go back to the
1970s. Links to all state high school associations are at:
http://www.nfhs.org/scriptcontent/Va_Custom/Directory/MemberDirectory.cfm
Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act Data (EADA): Under Title IX, all colleges and universities
receiving federal funds must file this report. Since 2001, the reports have been filed electronically
and are available in a database (can request full database from Office of Post-Secondary
Education). A searchable version of the database is located at: http://www.ope.ed.gov/athletics/
Data includes participation numbers, numbers and average salaries for coaches, revenues and
expenditures for each sport.

Integrated Post-Secondary Education System Data (IPEDS): A monster database from the
Dept of Education. Entire database can be downloaded from the Web. For each school, you’ll
find things such as enrollment by race/ethnicity; revenue and expenditure by source of income
and type of expense; salaries of FT instructional faculty by academic rank and tenure status;
completions by type of program, level of award, race/ethnicity and gender; and many other
details. Nothing specific to athletics, however this might be a supplement to something you do
regarding colleges. http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/
Special Assistance Fund for Student-Athletes: The NCAA doles out about $10 million
annually to the conferences, which then disperse this money to student athletes for various
purposes. There are four categories for how the money can be spent:
1) clothing/travel between home and campus and other essential expenses
2) Expendable academic course supplies (notebooks, pens) and rental of non-expendable
supplies (computer, camera) that are required for a course
3) medical and dental costs not covered by another insurance program
4) costs associated with a student-athlete or family emergencies
The conferences are required to report annually to the NCAA how this money is used but the
information they send (and the NCAA has stored in a database for the past three years) is very
summarized. You should be able to get at least a little more detail from the individual schools.
Here are the NCAA summary reports:
