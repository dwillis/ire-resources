TIPS FOR REPORTING ON VACCINES,
MERCURY AND AUTISM

2006 IRE National Conference – Fort Worth, TX
“When science goes wrong: Investigations into vaccines and drugs”
This subject is not only emotionally wrought and highly controversial, it is also very
complex and difficult to report on. (For an excellent analysis of the media’s coverage of
this subject, I highly recommend Daniel Schulman’s article, “Drug Test,” in the
November/December 2005 issue of Columbia Journalist Review -- www.cjr.org). Still,
the ongoing debate – in science, medicine, politics and the courts – does make for
some interesting and provocative investigations.
In my opinion, despite declarations from public health agencies such as the Centers For
Disease Control and Prevention and the Institute of Medicine, the jury is still very much
out on this controversy. It is incumbent upon investigative reporters to continue to
follow this story to it’s natural conclusion –Namely, did an overload of mercury from
childhood vaccines contribute to the rise of autism, ADD, ADHD and other disorders in
the US, or did it not? The answer is either yes or no.
Like all good stories, the debate over the mercury-based vaccine preservative,
thimerosal (pronounced “thigh-MARE-ih-sall) has two sides, each quite adamant about
its own position. What follows is a summary of the major players on each side of the
argument.
SUPPORTERS OF RESEARCH ON THE THIMEROSAL/AUTISM THEORY
Autism and Parent Groups
COALITION FOR SAFE MINDS – The original parents’ group to investigate the theory,
their website is focused mostly on issues of basic science, medicine and epidemiology –
Contact: Lyn Redwood, Mark Blaxill, Sallie Bernard at www.safeminds.org
NATIONAL AUTISM ASSOCIATION – One of the leading groups arguing for more federal
research dollars into mercury and autism and for protecting the right of parents to
receive compensation for their children’s illness. Contact: Laura Bono, Wendy Fournier,
Rita Shreffler at www.nationalautismassociation.org
AUTISM SPEAKS – New group founded by NBC Chairman Bob Wright and his wife
Suzanne after their grandson was diagnosed with autism. The group has already raised
millions of dollars and is announcing its first round of research grants in June, 2006. It
has vowed to fund mercury studies as well. www.autismspeaks.org
AUTISM SOCIETY OF AMERICA – This large, mainstream organization with chapters
nationwide recently announced its support of research into mercury and autism – a
major step for them. www.autismsociety.org
CURE AUTISM NOW – Very large, LA-based foundation that has raised and granted
millions of dollars in research, so far most of it on the genetics of autism. Contact: Jon
Shestack, Portia Iverson - www.cureautismnow.com

A-CHAMP – The first ever political action committee dedicated to lobbying Congress and
aiding politicians who support mercury-autism research. Contact: Bob Krakow, Bobbie
Manning, Lujene Clark – www.a-champ.org
AUTISM ONE – Organizers of the largest annual autism conference in the US and
producers of Autism One Radio, which is a great (archived) resource in itself. Contact:
Ed Arranga, Teri Small www.autismone.org
GENERATION RESCUE – Parents group dedicated to promoting awareness of chelation
therapy (removal of heavy metals from the body) as a possible treatment of autism.
Contact: JB Handley, Kevin Barry - www.generationrescue.org
UNLOCKING AUTISM – One of the first groups to identify a possible connection
between mercury and autism, they also provide assistance to families with urgent needs
(ie. Katrina evacuees). Contact Shelley Reynolds, Nancy Kale www.unlockingautism.org
NATIONAL VACCINE INFORMATION CENTER – Has been investigating the link between
vaccines and autism long before thimerosal was identified as a possible cause. Based in
the DC area and very active in national politics. Contact: Barbara Loe Fisher www.909shot.com
AUTISM RESEARCH INSTITUTE / DEFEAT AUTISM NOW (DAN!) – Trains doctors in
chelation therapies and other experimental biomedical interventions for autism. Contact
Maureen O’Donnell at www.autismresearchinstitute.com

OPPONENTS OF THE THIMEROSAL/AUTISM THEORY
Government Agencies
CDC - NATIONAL IMMUNIZATION PROGRAM – The CDC has published numerous
papers on this issue. Visit the "Mercury and Vaccines" page at
www.cdc.gov/nip/vacsafe/concerns/thimerosal/default.htm
FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION – The Center for Biologics Evaluation and Review
is responsible for vaccine safety. CBER has a page called "Thimerosal in Vaccines" at
www.fda.gov/cber/vaccine/thimerosal.htm

Medical and Academic Groups
INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE – Has issued two reports on thimerosal and autism (October
2001 and May 2004) The second report came down definitively against the theory,
though it has been questioned by some politicians, researchers and parents. Reports
and meeting minutes can be found of the page "Immunization Safety Review: Vaccines
and Autism" - www.nap.edu/books/030909237X/html
INSTITUTE FOR VACCINE SAFETY - JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY – Good review of
the evidence against the theory can be found on the "Thimerosal in Vaccines" page at
www.vaccinesafety.edu/cc-thim.htm
AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS – Adamant opponents of the theory, the have
also lobbied against state bills to ban mercury from vaccines. More info is at their
Autism Page – www.aap.org/healthtopics/autism.cfm
IMMUNIZATION ACTION COALITION – Run by parents but funded by CDC and others,
they provide ample information to refute the mercury theory at the page: "Thimerosal
Information" www.immunize.org/safety/thimerosal.htm
