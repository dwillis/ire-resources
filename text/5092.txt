Local incentive reporting
● Meet your local economic development director;
have two conversations
○ What types of incentives are offered
○ Their process for vetting companies (in
pre-incentive and post-incentive; the latter
particularly if they’re performance-based)
○ Usually finance/clerk’s office staff involved in
the vetting process, so introduce yourself
● Getting the records
○ Incentive agreement, any extensions or
addendums to agreement, employee roster,
receipts from capital improvement. Get
spreadsheet of all incentive projects - great
context for indv. stories
○ Reports from software used to determine
cost/benefits of awarding incentive packages
○ Also helpful to search/request emails (w/ name
of company) from county commissioners or
anyone else involved in incentive decisions
● Getting the businesses to talk - the fun part!
○ They likely will not want to, so put on your
business hat and be a salesperson
○ Use the connection with your economic
development director/other government sources
to find the right person and get them to talk
○ Be persistent, doorstep them if needed
