Multiple choice forms just don’t cut it when I want to know what students
really thought of a training course or session that I’ve designed, led, coached or
paid a consultant to teach.
Since journalists are accustomed to (a) being opinionated and, (b) writing
narrative, I take advantage of both by distributing a one-page evaluation form
with open-ended questions like:
1. Identify and explain the strong points of the course/session you just
took.
2. Identify and explain the weak points of the course/session you just
took.
3. If you were in charge of the training, what would you do differently?
The results are more targeted and revealing than any measurement
instrument utilizing multiple choice or Likert scale answers. And, that’s exactly
what I want. Constructive criticism that is detailed enough to quickly effect
change.
Effective evaluation of a course or session is really this simple. Try it the
next time you want results you can use in the real world and let me know how it
goes.
