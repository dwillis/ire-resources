Facial Recognition
How is it used? Using an algorithm, it compares facial structures to drivers license pictures
and available mug shots. Marketing and security firms also use it.
Where is it used? 16 states permit its use, according to a report from Georgetown Law’s
Center for Privacy and Technology. Only five of them have laws governing their use. Most do
not. The Atlantic reported that half of the U.S. population was captured in facial recognition
databases.
Why is it problematic?

Disproportionately affects marginalized groups, namely African-Americans and Latinx
High error rate (i.e., false negatives)
No uniform standards for the technology (e.g., lighting, contrast), data storage, or when
the tech can/should be used

Social Media
How is it used? Law enforcement agencies use publicly available social media posts to
monitor behavior, whereabouts, and potential criminal activity. They also ask social media
companies for information regarding specific groups or individuals.
Where is it used? Everywhere. Social media surveillance has been used across the country
to apprehend suspects and even suppress protests.
Why is it problematic?

Disproportionately affects marginalized groups because of increased contact with
police
Can be a form of profiling (i.e., snap judgments about who a person is or what their
motives are based on a tweet or who they’re friends with)
Not always accurate because messages can be misinterpreted or intentionally
misleading

License Plate Readers
How is it used? Scanners in police vehicles automatically read license plates and store data
either locally or by a third party
Where is it used? Pretty ubiquitous. It’s how police departments determine whether a person
has outstanding warrants or a criminal history.
Why is it problematic?

Disproportionately affects marginalized groups, typically the poor and people of color
Data is often stored indefinitely
Used very frequently: A third-party LPR firm, Vigilant Solutions, said it collected up to
100 million a month for police departments in 2015.
Not 100 percent accurate. The Chicago Tribune reported that parked cruisers would
scan nearby addresses on mailboxes and street signs in addition to nearby license
plates.

Body Cameras
How are they used? Worn by police officers as a way of recording encounters with civilians.
Meant as an accountability tool and made popular following the 2014 police killing of
Michael Brown and the public pressure for police reform. Commended for reducing use of
force.
Where are they used? A 2014 survey by the National Institute of Justice said 75 percent of
those surveyed did not use them. That same year, the ACLU estimated up to 30 percent of
the 17,000 police departments used them.
Why are they problematic?

States can have access to the tech without laws or guidelines in place
Laws governing use aren’t everywhere: 40 states have laws on the books but contents
of when and how to use the tech differ
Police officers don’t like to or forget to use them (e.g., Footage of the police shooting of
Terrence Sterling in Maryland missed the first minute of encounter)

Drones/Plane Surveillance
How are they used? Deployed to survey specific areas usually during disaster or active
shooter scenarios.
Where are they used? At least 347 police and fire departments have acquired them,
according to Bard College’s drone study center report. Sixty percent of those are law
enforcement agencies, another 20 percent are fire departments.
Why are they problematic?
●
●

Disproportionately targets marginalized groups (e.g., Muslims, people of color, poor)
Can be weaponized: North Dakota was first state to allow police to use drones to taser
and pepper spray Dakota Access Pipeline protesters.

●

Inconsistent or missing protocols and data practices

Data Analysis
How is it used? Typically comes in the form of predictive crime heat maps, which show
physical locations where criminal activity is concentrated, or threat indices, which calculate a
person’s likelihood to commit a crime based on available data. (Yep, just like Minority
Report.)
Where is it used? Unclear how many but various departments across the U.S. use crime
maps, including some in California, Arizona, Minnesota, New York, and Colorado.
Why is it problematic?
●

●

Disproportionately targets marginalized groups because of reliance on reported crime
data and tendency to over-police in poorer areas or those with a high POC
concentration
Tech is still pretty new and developing

DNA Databases
How are they used? If you’ve ever submitted your DNA for genetic testing through services
like Ancestry or 23andMe, the police can get it.
Where are they used? This isn’t tracked very much so it’s unclear how many agencies use
this regularly, but police do need a court order to get the information.
Why are they problematic?
●
●
●

Data is held by third parties, which aren’t required to be transparent about the data they
collect
DNA identification is fallible
People of color, namely African-Americans or those with mixed heritage, are particularly
vulnerable

Stingrays and Signal Sniffers
How are they used? Antiterrorism devices that pretend to be cellphone towers to get a
phone’s location data. Jugulars or Wolfhounds sniff out passive signals emitted from
cellphones to collect location data.
Where are they used? Used by local police departments, the FBI, and ICE. Stingrays typically
require a warrant for use but Wolfhounds/Jugulars do not.
Why are they problematic?
●
●
●

Can snag data from passersby along with targeted suspects. (e.g., A North Carolina
police department used the devices weekly for eight years and stored data indefinitely)
Disproportionately affect marginalized groups (e.g., immigrants, people of color, etc.)
Stingrays can listen to phone calls

CCTV
How is it used? Cameras are posted on and inside of buildings by law enforcement.
Where are they used? Used by local police departments and federal agencies.
Why are they problematic?
●

●

Raises “big brother” privacy concerns about always being watched
Iffy data storage protocols
Vulnerable to malware (e.g., Ahead of President Donald Trump’s inauguration, the
Metropolitan Police Department’s CCTV system was infected with ransomware,
malicious software that holds data and access hostage until a ransom is paid.)
