Breaking news hands-on
Jaimi Dowdell & Megan Luther, IRE/NICAR
One of the best ways to get better at digging on deadline is to practice. In this exercise, we want you to imagine that you’re a journalist in New
Orleans and you hear that an explosion has happened at the Citgo Petroleum Plant in Sulphur, LA. Get a game plan and figure out where you
want to search. Try to find as much information that can help you move the story forward with a watchdog eye. Set the clock as a timer for 5- to
10-minute intervals to see how quickly you can find information. Once you’re done, look through our resources and steps below. You might even
find more than we came up with! In this exercise we’ll focus on online resources, but don’t forget there are plenty of human and other sources
not available on the web that can help you in your search. We’d like to thank Stephen Stock for providing this example.

Just the facts for starters
You hear that there was an explosion at the Citgo Petroleum Corporation Plant in Sulphur, LA. What do you do?
1) The first thing we did was go to Google. We searched for “Citgo Petroleum sulphur, LA.” This led us to an address: “4401 Highway 108
W, Sulphur, LA.”
The power of maps allows us to look at things immediately. Go to Google maps and look for this address with satellite imagery. You find
that the map doesn’t look correct. What’s the deal, there doesn’t seem to be a plant there?

2) Because this is a petroleum plant, we know that it has to be regulated by certain agencies. Let’s start with the Environmental Protection
Agency. A good place to start there is the EPA Toxics Release inventory.

a. Go to TRI: http://www.epa.gov/enviro/facts/tri/search.html
b. All the way at the bottom of this page, under “Search values,” check “multisystem facility search”

c.

Toward the top, under “Facility Selection” enter “CITGO” under “Facility Identification Option Value:” Then hit search.

d. You’ll find 23 sites across the US. You should find a site with the same address, but notice that the city is different.

e. Double check this address by copying the values for latitude and longitude. Go to maps.google.com and past in the latitude and
longitude like this: “30.171958, -93.319905.” Look at the result with Google Earth.

This looks more like something that is a plant and could potentially cause problems if there really was an explosion.
3) Check Census for demographic information. How many people live in the area? Easiest place census.ire.org. Census Tract is a great way
to look at this. We went to the 2010 census population map from census.gov and looked at Sulphur, LA and found our location on the
map to find the right Tract: #32.

With the right Tract, we went to census.ire.org and drilled down. It would likely be useful to look at neighboring tracts as well once you
know the situation with the explosion:

Using this site you can add geography to compare:

Digging Deeper
1) Let’s go back to your EPA search - what else can you find from that record?
a. From our EPA results page, click on “View Facility Information” (So many things to see here! You can also verify the address.
Look to see all of the data source/regulation entities listed at the bottom. You’re also given SIC and NAICS industry codes that
you can use for more general searches later. Also listed are potential regulatory contacts and )
http://oaspub.epa.gov/enviro/fii_query_dtl.disp_program_facility?pgm_sys_id_in=70602CTGPTHIGHW&pgm_sys_acrn
m_in=TRIS

Make sure you click through some of these links. You can find a lot of information doing that. For example, when I clicked on the
“Information System ID” number next to the “National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System“ link, I found that this plant is not
in compliance. If you click through further, you can also get a list of its pollutants.

b. Now go back and click on the “TRI Facility ID Number” What do you see here?

2) OSHA is another good place to search for information on plants, businesses, etc. even when there isn’t breaking news. If you cover an
industry or a particular business, we suggest checking this out before something happens.
a. Just go to OSHA.gov and look for the “Data & Statistics” tab. This is the gateway to a lot of nice searches on the site. Try the
facility search: https://www.osha.gov/pls/imis/establishment.html
Here’s how we searched:

Here are the results:

This screen tells you a lot. You get the Activity number, the date the record was opened, whether it was a planned inspection or
one following a complaint. You also get the SIC (Standard Industry Classification) code (use for general searches later) and the
number of violations. Click through the Activity number for more details. Also, keep in mind that electronic records are just a
starting point. You can always request the paper documents behind these records and they might have more information.
Request those with this information from the regional OSHA office. Do it early and be prepared to wait because those
documents can take a while to arrive, but are usually worth the wait.
b) Once you click through you should see a summary of the violations, penalties, etc. Notice that violations and penalties can get
negotiated down throughout the process. This can be interesting to look into. Notice in this example there were 19 initial violations
(3 of which were willful) and that was negotiated down to 10. The penalties also were lessened.

c) Put this into context. We know that the plant’s main SIC code is 2911 for Petroleum Refineries. Go back to OSHA’s “Data & Statistics”
tab and look for the option to search inspections by SIC. Go there and run a search like this:

This will give you an idea if there are other companies out there with the same SIC in the state (or you can narrow down by office as
well). It might be useful, or it might not. Is there an industry problem? These could also be potential sources.
d) Also be sure to use the “Accident investigation search.” This will give you some narrative results. In the search below, we used the
“2911” SIC code and narrowed down to OSHA Region six, the region covering Louisiana.

You get 20 results allowing you to see what other accidents have happened in the OSHA Region. Notice that you can see fatalities
listed as well. Click through to a result so you can see the type of narratives included in these records:

e) This may seem fairly basic, but be sure to use a search engine such as Google to look for things like this: “OSHA citgo Louisiana.”
When we did that search we found this document using the following link:
https://www.google.com/search?q=OSHA+citgo+louisiana&rlz=1C1RNLH_enUS521US521&oq=OSHA+citgo+louisiana&aqs=chrome..
69i57.3155j0j7&sourceid=chrome&espv=210&es_sm=122&ie=UTF-8

The search also finds the following document:

3)

If you do a little research on the OSHA website you’ll likely find the Enforcement page. On that page is a link to a list of the “Highest
Issued Penalty Cases” under “quick links.” https://www.osha.gov/dep/enforcement/top_cases.html You’ll find that our plant is #7
with an accident in 1991.

Check past investigations by US Chemical Safety Board http://www.csb.gov/investigations?F_InvestigationId=91&Type=undefined
This result is for a CITGO refinery in Texas, but you can find out a decent amount from these reports.

4) Check Union filings for contacts. http://kcerds.dol-esa.gov/query/getOrgQry.do
In a search for unions in “Sulphur, Lousiana” we found this list:

If you click through to a report, you’ll see a lot of information (that can be useful for other stories as well) but for now, we’re interested
in the contact information such as this. You may not find the specific union representing the plant employees, but chances are other
people in the labor industry, such as our contact below, will be able to help you.

5) Do an advanced google search: “Citgo” under “site: louisiana.gov”
https://www.google.com/search?q=citgo+site%3Alouisiana.gov&rlz=1C1RNLH_enUS521US521&oq=citgo+site%3Alouisiana.gov&aqs=chr
ome..69i57.5536j0j4&sourceid=chrome&espv=210&es_sm=122&ie=UTF-8
You’ll find interesting things like the document below:

**Don’t forget to narrow down your search by filetype. We recommend XLS, PDF and PPT
For example, searching: “Citgo Site:Louisiana.gov filetype:xls” you find things like: A spreadsheet of Water System data from the Louisiana State
Department of Health siting that Citgo has two water systems that must be tested annually and reported to the state.
6) Check local courts and PACER for lawsuits.

Search social media
Since this is a pretend exercise, we obviously don’t have anything we can search for social media. If you want to practice this, when breaking
news happens elsewhere, try to search on social media as if you were covering the event yourself. We promise it’ll help sharpen your skills for
when you need them.
1) Geofeedia will allow you to search for social media by geography. This can be a good way to track down the location and potential
sources - http://geofeedia.com/
2) Banjo is a mobile app that also searches by geography.
a)

Search LinkedIn for Citgo employees in LA. There you will find the plant manager, inspector, communications specialist, etc. Don’t forget to
change your security preferences so you are anonymous.

b)

Search http://whostalkin.com/search?q=Citgo&x=0&y=0 to find sources who are talking about the explosion on social media

That’s all we’ve got for now, but we’d love to hear more about what you find. Feel free to send us more tips and resources and we’d love to
hear from you about your next breaking news investigation.
