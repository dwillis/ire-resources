Show Your Hard Work -documents, extra video, more in-depth version
Keep Story Alive - inside sources will typically blog anonymously
Behind the Scenes -why & how you did the story

Usina Data to Map In formation
Think Globally, Tell stories Locally (narrowly)
Retell Local Stories Globally and allow your viewer to "narrow" them using
mapping
Start with small projects
Have a vision of what story will look like and make compelling pitch
Don't take "no" for an answer
Find another way to get data
Think about how every story you do can be supported by data
Think about different ways to tell a story using "the same old data"
Ask questions about what data might tell you at the front end
Learn about CAR even...ESPECIALLY... if you don't want to or it bores you
Learn the power of databases
Admit when you don't know and seek help (from IRE or some other
person/group who does know how to work data)

The Perks
You actually get to interact with your viewers
Expand Your Franchise On Air and Online
Increase Ratings + Page Views
Create Interactive Online Elements that Keep Your Franchise Alive When You're
Not On-Air

The Pitfalls
Anyone can post anything on these sites
It's up to you t o confirm
What may appear to be "Fair Use" may NOT be
Ownership and Copyright lssues play role
Make sure you're in control of when the story breaks.
Remember - Nothing is truly Private
Once it's out there, it's out there forever
Check security settings
Private vs. Professional Profile
Be careful of what you put on social networking pages -- i.e., your political
endorsements, and other personal things can come back to damage your
credibility.
