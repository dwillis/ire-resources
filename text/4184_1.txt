What makes a good project?
● Reporting a project off a beat is hard. Make it easier on yourself by pursuing a question
that fascinates you.
● Ask yourself: Who cares? Is anyone harmed?
● Have a data and documents state­of­mind: What records will help answer the question?
Selling it to your boss
● Do enough reporting so that editors can see the promise of your story.
● If it’s going to take a drawn­out records request, you’ll need buy­in from your organization.
● Have an insurance policy to sell along with the story: Even if you come up empty­handed,
what else could you write? If an agency says the records you seek don’t exist, does that
mean it lacks information important to doing its job?
● Bring in others. Photographers, graphic designers, web developers can enrich the project
and also give others a stake in moving it forward.
Getting the records
● Before you file a big data request, speak with the agency. Working out problems on the
front­end can save significant time and effort on the back end. Figure out the
nomenclature the agency uses and use that in your request.
● Ask for documents in their native formats or as an Excel, CSV (comma separated
values) or text export. You can later use these spreadsheets in various free data
visualization tools.
● Know your state’s open records laws: http://www.rcfp.org/open­government­guide
○ To celebrate our nation’s independence, read your state’s open records law every
year on July 4 (or use your country’s national holiday as a marker). Don’t forget to
read case law. Read open meetings law on your birthday.
● Remember: When you draft your request, you are not writing to the agency. You are not
writing to the mayor. You are writing to a judge on the chance your request gets denied.
Be clear in what you want. (See sample records request below).
● File that records request. Use a spreadsheet or calendar to track when when the
response from the agency is due.
● Are stubborn officials refusing to give you anything but PDFs? Cometdocs will cleanly
convert those files to Word, Excel or other formats.
Stonewalled?

●

Is there an advisory board, task force or legislator who might give you the data? Keep
writing angry letters. CC your bosses, a lawyer you know, legislators, etc. Just be sure
you know the state’s open records law.
● Appeal the records denial. Each agency should have an appeals process (or maybe
there is one outlined in state law). Be polite in your emails. A judge might have to review it
later.
Data analysis
● Before you do anything with the data, make a copy of the original. The last thing you want
to do is lose the original file and screw up the spreadsheet you were given.
● In analyzing the data, don’t make things more difficult than they have to be. Sort and sum
functions sometimes do the trick.
● Be skeptical of the data. Look for blank fields, numbers that don’t add up. Perhaps above
all, look for outliers. They may alert you to errors in the data, or put you on to a very
interesting story.
Free (or nearly so) data tools for small newsrooms:
Data visualization can help reporters, editors and readers understand a complex subject. By
using data and visualizations regularly in daily reporting, it’s easier to convince your editor of their
value, and your ability to work with data, in longer­term stories. When you have numbers, make
maps and data visualizations:
● Infogram and Datawrapper — Creates online interactive graphics.
● StoryMap — Creates a map with clickable links.
● Google Fusion Tables — Can easily create maps, such as “how did they vote” maps.
● Tableau Public — Can create robust interactives
● Open Refine (formerly Google Refine) — Used to clean dirty data. For instance,
computers read “Mount Vernon” “Mt. Vernon” and Mt Vernon” as three different places.
Open Refine will change all of those to whichever form you prefer.
● Cometdocs: File conversion (i.e. PDFs to spreadsheets)
● FOIA Machine: Tracks your records requests and can send you reminders.
● Open Office (if you cannot get Excel)
Selling data stories to your editors:
Pulitzer prize­winning reporter Ken Armstrong has noted that data­driven stories help reporters
state bold conclusions and write with authority. Data helps “inform the debate.”
● Government agencies, nonprofits, universities and others release data or studies. Use
the findings to pitch to your editor that a story exists.
● Politicians often promise to act on studies when they're released. If they haven't taken
action, a "broken promises" angle could sell the story.
● Sometimes you will want to report a story out a little bit before pitching to an editor. In
these cases, file records requests, talk with a few sources and send your editor a memo
or proposed lede for the story.

●

If your editor is still reluctant to approve data stories, your newspaper or TV station likely
already runs data stories many times a year using crime statistics, education test
scores, budgets and more.

Writing and reporting data stories:
● Data can have errors because data is created by people. It can lie, it can mislead. Make
sure your data tells the right story. Talk to the agency’s data manager if you suspect
there might be integrity issues with the data. If you are still unsure, reach out to IRE
members for help.
● Anchor yourself with a question or two. Crafting a central question you want to
answer will help you stay focused as your reporting evolves. Tweak it as necessary.
● Report and write data stories in stages. It can be much easier to find time to file a
data request than for an entire project all at once. Consider filing a few long­term data
requests and then fulfilling short­term duties while you wait for the requests to come
back. It can be a lot easier to get the time to pursue a data project once you have the data
in hand.
● Data leads to people. Use data to find individuals affected by the issue you're
uncovering. Go a step further than just publishing what the numbers say to connect with
readers in a different way.
General advice:
● Keep a contact list, personal calendar, timelines or notes in a spreadsheet so you’re
constantly using spreadsheets on a daily basis.
● Seek out additional CAR training through IRE. Weeklong CAR training at Mizzou.
Hands­on training at this conference and others. Fellowships offered for reporters at
small newspapers, thanks to Daniel Gilbert.

Sample records request format
To:
[records custodian name, title]
From: [Your name, title, news org affiliation, city, state]
Date: [Date]
This is a request under RCW 42.56, the Washington Open Public Records Act [Your state
open records law, list here: http://www.rcfp.org/open­government­guide], for the following
records:
** [INFORMATION ON WHAT I WANT HERE. Use bullet points and be very specific if
possible]
[Only for database requests] In addition, please provide copies of the record layout, code sheet
and all relevant documentation regarding this data. I am requesting all data fields. If there are any
fields that you must withhold by law, please cite this omission in the redaction log.
I would like to receive this data in electronic format. I can accept this data on CD­ROM, via email
or FTP.

[Optional, only for database requests] To avoid problems with data, would you please provide
a comma delimited or ASCII text file, a format that can be easily opened by any spreadsheet or
database program. I can also accept ASCII text, dbase IV, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Access and
many other formats (just let me know and I'll see if we can use it).
[Optional, for database requests] As you're aware, any database program has the ability to
easily output data in a variety of formats. And if there is information that is exempt from
disclosure, one of the great things about electronic records is that such a field of data can be
redacted with a mouse click. Providing data electronically is fast, it's cheap, it saves everyone
time.
If some of this material will take longer to provide than other portions, please provide information
as soon as it is available.
Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help clarify or expedite this request. I look
forward to hearing from you and appreciate your assistance.
Sincerely,
