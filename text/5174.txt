Consumer Investigations Resources
By: Myriam Masihy

Drumming up business: If you’re starting a consumer investigative unit and need to get calls coming
into your hotline, get yourself out there. Consumers may not be calling you but they are calling
advocacy or regulatory agencies such as: consumer affairs, attorney general’s offices, BBB, CFO’s ,
business regulation, elder affairs, health department, office of financial regulation, office of
insurance regulation, education departments, transportation department, environmental
protection, highway, state attorney, etc.
Databases: See what data is available. Many municipalities are putting databases of 311 calls,
employee salaries and check registers on their websites. They look like this:

Other databases that are usually open include the local clerk of court which has civil and criminal
cases and sometimes offers free marriage license information that may include a date of birth. Also
check your property appraiser’s office for tax stories.
Community Organizations: Remember that in order to be the voice of your community, you need to
be part of it. Become involved in community organizations. Attend trade associations meetings
including bar associations. Lawyers always have stories. Get in touch with veteran affairs offices
and immigrant coalitions. Make sure to get on their distribution lists.
FOIA/Public Records Request: Get in the habit of requesting public records and submitting FOIA
request that have to do with stories you are working on or issues that have surfaced in your
community. You need to be the reporter in your newsroom that digs deeper. Ask for things like
your town’s “check registry” or dashcam/bodycam video of a controversial crash. To submit FOIA’s
like a pro, you can use free generators like www.ifoia.org
