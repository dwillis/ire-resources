Outline
o
o
o
o

Organize your thoughts/prioritize.
What’s the main focus of the story? Problem? Solution/who can fix it?
What’s your best video? Time permitting, shoot more! What’s your best
sound?
Who are your characters? Avoid using too many/confusing the issue.

o What supporting documents do you have? Use your resources to make
those look better…animation/moving video (treated) as a
background/lighting

•

Conflicts- What’s holding me back?
o
o

o

Time constraints – most important issue/ narrow your characters
Lack of video – the newspaper story theory/ shoot more
Too much to tell – can it be broken up into parts? Stick to the most
important issues.

• Get everyone involved
o
o

•

Communication starts the minute your story begins and continues until the
last story ends.
Talk with (not to) your photographer/editor/reporter/producer...take
ownership

The interview
o

Don’t paint yourself into a corner/ have the subject answer the same
question without them knowing it.

o Questions/answers...give yourself options...what’s more important, the
question or the answer?

•

Writing
o

Don’t close your eyes to other ideas! No one way is the right way, each
story can be told in a different way.

o Emphasize your points throughout your story...make sure the viewer will
remember the important stuff.

•

Foreshadow
o

•

o Use quick elements/best video/sound
Pacing elements
o

•

The tease within the story/grab the viewer- let them know what’s coming
up.

Quick bites for nat sound/good video/use your editor

o Break up long tracks avoid long bites.
What to leave out
o
o
o

When time is the issue, leave out the process. What’s more important how
you got the story and worked on it, or the story itself.
The duh-factor- if it’s obvious, you may be able to leave it out.
Avoid the redundant track…no need to say it twice in the same thought.

o Tangents- avoid points that keep you from your main focus of the story

•

Wrap it up and keep it strong
o

Get back to the emotion/the reason why you decided to move forward with
the story in the first place.
