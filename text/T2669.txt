Importing HTML tables using Microsoft Excel
By Ron Nixon, IRE/NICAR
Getting HTML tables into Microsoft Excel used to be labor intensive and problematic.
You could go to the webpage, copy and paste the information, but this often caused
problems with getting the data to line-up correct and embedded links which tried to
connect to a webpage. Alternatively you could have downloaded the webpage, imported
it, then cleared the formatting and then save it to an older version to get rid of the links.
Fortunately, starting with Excel 2000, Microsoft has made importing HTML files easy.
Open a blank Excel workbook. Click on Data, Import External Data, then New Web
Query.

This will bring you to the New Web Query box. Type the URL for the webpage you want
in this case www.eeoc.gov and hit Go. By default, the query will start on whatever page
you have saved as you homepage.

Navigate to the section of the page labeled Statistics. It is in the middle of the page. Once
at the statistics section, scroll down the page a little to see the topics available in this
section. Click on “Employment Statistics.” Click on “Job Patterns for Women and
Minorities in Private Industry”. Click on “2001 tables” and then click on “MSA
aggregate.” Select any one of the MSA’s. I’ve chosen Bakersville as shown below.

Now hit the import button. Your screen should look like the one below. Now Hit the OK
button in the import data box. This will bring the data into our spreadsheet

The data should appear in the spreadsheet without the HTML formatting and cleared of
any hyperlinks.
