Corporations and other businesses

12 Regional Corporations

Alaska native corporations (ANC) were
formed when Congress passed the Alaska
Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971.
The act allotted 40 million acres of land for division among 12
regional native corporations and 220 village corporations.
Alaska natives and descendants born before 1971 were allowed to
receive 100 shares in their village corporation and regional
corporation.
There were originally twelve Alaska regional corporations. In 1975, a
13th corporation formed to represent Alaska natives residing outside
the state of Alaska, but it was dissolved in 2013. Today there are 198
village corporations.

In 1986, Congress passed legislation that allowed ANCs to
participate in the Small Business Administration's disadvantaged
business program, known as the 8(a) program, which sets aside
federal contracts for minority-owned or other disadvantaged
companies.
With strong advocacy from Alaska Sen. Ted Stevens, Congress later
extended to ANCs additional special 8(a) benefits, such as the
ability to win no-bid contracts for any amount and to own multiple
subsidiaries in the program.

ANC data and documents
• ANCs with at least 500 shareholders and $1
million in assets must file annual reports and
and election proxy statements with the
Alaska Division of Banking and Securities. All
regional corporations meet that threshold, as
do 28 village corporations.
• Some ANCs make these available on their
websites or sometimes you can get copies
from a shareholder.

ANC data and documents
• Court records: The Dept. of Banking and
Securities regulates filings – all other
complaints go through courts
• Alaska courts
• VA, MD
• PACER

ANC data and documents
• Lexis-Nexis
• Leadership directories

Key data points
• Revenue versus dividends. Some ANC
companies make billions in revenue, but little
goes back to the shareholders.
• Executive pay versus dividends
• Location of annual meetings. Some ANCs
hold their annual meetings in locations that
are not accessible to villagers.
