BUSINESS INVESTIGATIONS AND COOKING THE BOOKS

PART I: PENETRATING THE CORPORATE FORTRESS
•

•

•
•

The last few years have demonstrated how untrustworthy corporations are in
reporting about their own activities and financial condition. Enron, Worldcom,
Tyco, Ahold are just a few examples of companies that lied massively to
shareholders and the public. The consequences were serious. Thousands of
people lost their jobs or their retirement savings.
The supposed watchdogs were asleep. Professional accounting firms ignored
regularities or even abetted deception, as with Arthur Andersen and Enron.
Bank analysts were far too cozy with the companies they covered. Salomon
Brother’s analyst Jack Grubman continued to recommend Worldcom shares
even as the company was imploding.
It also wasn’t journalism’s finest hour. Too many publications were caught up
in the hype or reported in a superficial way. Relied too much on bank analysts
for outside comment.
One lesson is that journalists, despite their shortcomings, are often the only
observers without a strong financial incentive to skew the facts. There is an
opportunity for journalists to help prevent future ripoffs.

GETTING PAST THE SPINMEISTERS
•
•

As much as the public relations and investor relations people try to control the
news, all companies must interact extensively with outsiders. Getting to these
people is the key to understanding the business.
Who are the people with inside knowledge?

PARTNERS AND ANTAGONISTS
• Competitors, business rivals.
• Suppliers, ex-suppliers. For example, if covering an auto company, call a
brake maker. (Suppliers often brag about their big customers on web sites.)
• Customers, ex-customers.
• Regulatory agencies. (Stock market regulators, bank regulators, telecom
regulators, etc.)
• Lawyers who specialize in suing companies. Often keen to get publicity.
ANALYSTS

•
•
•
•

Business school professors. Do case studies of companies and often have good
access. Some universities post case studies on the Internet.
Bank analysts good for financial analysis, but geared toward selling stock and
often overly optimistic.
Debt rating agencies: Standard & Poors (www.standardandpoors.com),
Moody’s.
Market research firms and pollsters (Gartner Group, Forrester Research).

INSIDERS
•
•
•
•

Labor unions, employee associations. Also use search engines to locate web
sites or chat groups operated by dissident employees.
Former employees and executives.
A company’s own subsidiaries. (Sometimes you can exploit internal company
rivalries.)
Industry associations and lobby groups. Often staffed with former executives
who are knowledgeable.

SUPPLIERS, OUTSOURCERS
•
•
•
•

Other outsourcers such as people who do management training programs.
Headhunters, such as Heidrick & Struggles, Egon Zehnder.
Consultants (usually only willing to speak confidentially).
Investment bankers. (Represent companies in acquisitions and divestments,
stock and bond placements)

INVESTORS
• Major shareholders and shareholder advocacy groups.
• Private equity firms. (Often very knowledgeable about any company that has
been for sale.) Big names include KKR, Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, Apax
Partners, CVC Capital Partners, many others.
• Short sellers. Investors or funds that specialize in this kind of investment have
an interest in exposing company shortcomings.
• A note of caution: Everybody has an agenda that may bias the information
they give you. Make sure you know what the agenda is.

FINDING THE PEOPLE WITH INSIDE KNOWLEDGE
•

•

Consultants. Start with the big names (such McKinsey; Booz, Allen Hamilton;
Boston Consulting; Accenture; Mercer Management Consulting; Roland
Berger in Germany.) If they don’t work for the company, they’ll know who
does.
Suppliers, customers, ex-executives. Every industry has its own trade press
that reports on contracts won and lost, executives coming and going. Usually

•

•
•
•

there is some kind of directory listing trade publications and industry
newsletters.
Shareholders. In most countries investors required to report to the stock
market regulator when they own more than a certain share, typically 5%.
Usually public information. Also: Big stock funds often have good access to
information.
Ex-executives. Keep a people file of press releases announcing management
changes. Talk to head hunting firms. Look at old annual reports to see who has
left. Google good for finding people.
Bond investors. Even companies not listed on the stock market may sell
corporate bonds. All big banks and investment funds are active in the bond
market.
Show your face. Financial information is sensitive information. People may
not talk to you unless they know you. Attend trade fairs and other industry
gatherings, press events, shareholder meetings, chamber of commerce lunches,
etc.

CHECK THE FACTS
•

•

Doublecheck executive cv’s. It’s amazing how often top managers lie about
their job and education history. Check universities to verify diplomas,
previous employers. Example: Jack Grubman falsely claimed he had a degree
from MIT.
Check backgrounds of board members. Are the independent? Qualified? (O.J.
Simpson was a member of the audit committee at Infinity Broadcasting Corp.)

READ THE FINE PRINT
•

•
•

•
•

Company officers can be held accountable for prospectus’ and other official
documents, which makes them more reliable. If there has been a stock or bond
offering, there has been a prospectus. If the company won’t give it to you, it
should be available from regulators, or from potential buyers such as public
stock and bond funds.
Unfortunately many European companies don’t have extensive reporting
requirements. In Germany there is no law preventing companies from lying
about earnings in a press release.
Companies listed in the U.S. required to make extensive filings to the SEC
which are available online via Edgar, Thomson Financial. Example: 20F is
detailed financial statement by a foreign company according to U.S. GAAP.
Check what companies say in official filings vs. what they say in press
releases. (www.sec.org)
Internal company newsletters and other publications. Sometimes
unintentionally revealing.
Learn how to analyze company financial statements, compare with
competitors. One basic example: A company that is spending substantially
more on personnel than a similar competitor may soon be forced to reduce the
workforce.

PART II: COOKING THE BOOKS
•

•

In the 1990s stock options caused managers to become excessively focused on
the company stock price. Meeting or beating analyst forecasts drove some to
outright deception (Worldcom, Enron, Tyco). More often, companies used
“legal” methods to skew numbers higher.
The outcome is nearly the same: to obscure or conceal a company’s true
financial condition from shareholders, creditors, suppliers, workers and the
public.

CRIMINAL BOOK COOKING
•

•
•
•

•

Hardest for a journalist to detect because it can take so many forms. By
definition goes on in secret, usually involves a small number of conspirators.
No one discovered Worldcom, Enron or Tyco until the companies were on the
verge of collapse.
There are exceptions: German journalist exposed Comroad, software maker
that fabricated almost all its sales.
How she did it: Found it odd that almost all sales came from a company in
Hong Kong. While on vacation, she went to Hong Kong at her own expense
and tried to locate the company. She could find no record it existed.
Interesting footnote: KPMG, Comroad’s official auditor, never made the same
effort even though it already had a large office in Hong Kong. KPMG
continued to defend Comroad well after the allegations came to light. Lesson:
Auditor’s stamp of approval is no guarantee everything is in order.
Comroad’s ceo confessed, sentenced to jail term.

“LEGAL” BOOK COOKING
•

•

•
•

Management bonuses often tied to net profit either directly or indirectly (for
example via stock options). Managers interests often different than investors
and employees. Some give in to the temptation to manipulate the bottom line.
There are nearly endless ways to do so. Just a few of the favourite methods:
Use of “pro forma” numbers. Popularized by New Economy companies such
as Amazon.com who claimed that traditional accounting standards didn’t
accurately reflect their business. Discredited but still amazingly widespread.
Example: Deutsche Telekom.
Booking sales before the money is in the bank. Ahold is example of probably
illegal sales inflation. But can be done legally. Example: FIFA “securitizing”
sales from future World Cups, booking the money as revenue.
Recording internal transactions as sales. Example: T-Online. Variation on the
same theme: Reciprocal sales to another company.

MORE LEGAL BOOK COOKING

•
•
•
•

Underestimating liability from lawsuits, especially for companies doing
business in the U.S. Example: ABB, asbestos lawsuits against subsidiary
Combustion Engineering.
Changing definitions of key expense categories. Easy way to inflate net profit.
Depreciation is favourite number to manipulate, but can also be done with
other categories such as debt. Example: Deutsche Telekom.
Moving liabilities off the books. For example, selling real estate then leasing it
back. Deutsche Telekom using this method to reduce debt, but in fact just
substitutes a rent payment for an interest payment.
Counting asset sales as operating income; counting expenses as one-time
losses. Obscures the profitability of the core business. Example: Bertelsmann
counted sale of stake in AOL Europe as part of operating profit. Losses from
Internet businesses were counted as extraordinary losses. (Trying to have it
both ways.).

WARNING SIGNS
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Abrupt departure of chief financial officer, other key managers. (“For personal
reasons.”)
Unexplained decline in share price. (Call traders or fund managers to find out
why.) Likewise, big shareholders getting rid of shares; management doing
same.
Official outside auditor (KPMG, Ernst & Young, etc.) expresses reservations
about some bookkeeping practices. (Check the back of the annual report.)
Official auditor resigns.
Surge in credit losses or accounts receivable. May mean company has been
lending money to customers to make purchases; customers can’t pay.
Benchmark with other companies in the same business.
Footnotes in the annual report. Often impenetrable; look for experts such as
good analysts or investors to help explain.
Downgrades by debt ratings services (Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s)
The most dangerous time is when a company’s business starts to go sour.
Remember: The Vatican has officially declared false bookkeeping to be a sin!

Good book: Financial Statement Analysis: A Practitioner’s Guide, by Martin Fridson
and Fernando Alvarez. (Wiley, 2002). Up to date and reasonably easy to understand.
