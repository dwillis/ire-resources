Why you can’t swoop in and expect to get the scoop

FIRST: THE DON’TS
• Please don’t:
• Practice parachute journalism.
• Try to be something you’re not.
• Act like you have nothing to learn from the communities you cover.
• Use people to fit your ideal narrative.
• Ignore attempts to reach out/pitch stories.
• Fail to correct mistakes promptly.
DO: TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SOCIAL MEDIA
• Facebook groups/pages
• Search for keywords including geographic area and racial/ethnic group. Join/follow as
many as you can.
• People in those groups or on those pages will post about events, rallies, issues etc. Attend
as much as you can for the sake of source-building.
• Try “Discover Groups” feature.
• Facebook algorithm is pretty good at surfacing posts that are gaining steam.
• Events
• Every week, spend about 15 minutes scrolling through Facebook Events tab. What would
be a good place to meet sources or a good event to cover?
DO: BUILD GOODWILL
• Say yes
• If diverse sources ask you to attend events, lunches, meetings, rallies, say yes whenever
you can.
• In shrinking newsrooms, it can be hard to justify spending time on something that
won’t directly lead to a story, but spending time with someone without expecting
something in return will help that person trust you. Tell people you are looking to
meet diverse community members because you want to find and tell the stories that
other news outlets don’t.
• Consider doing smaller stories you maybe wouldn’t do normally to show that you value
what it is important to that community.
• Let members of the community tell you how they feel or what the story is, rather than twisting
their comments or experiences to fit your own narrative.
• Seek out positive/solution-based stories, and advocate for them to editors

• You might get pushback. It’s your responsibility to explain the importance of representing
every reader. It will help build your audience long-term.
• If you have to say “no” to a pitch…
• Answer the source directly and explain why. Don’t let emails/calls go ignored.
• Connect the source to another reporter or editor if applicable.
• Provide tips for next time or alternate forums (columns, community submissions).
DO: ASK FOR RECOMMENDATIONS
• Ask connected community leaders, PIOs:
• “Who else should I know?”
• They can facilitate connections for you, and then they are vouching for you while
getting bonus points from their friend for getting them exposure.
• Ask “regular people”:
• “Who in the community is important?”
• “Who do you look up to?”
• “Who doesn’t represent you?”
DO: PAY ATTENTION TO DIVERSITY OFF THE CLOCK
• Take a look at your friends
• Do you only interact with people like you? Ideally, your job won’t be your only exposure to
people of different races, sexualities, religions or abilities.
• Friends will speak frankly about what’s on their mind, which can spark story ideas.
• Events
• Expose yourself to other communities’ events, gathering places, etc.
• Shows, websites
• Even if you don’t/can’t meet many people who are different from you, you should be reading and watching things that are important or relevant to their communities.
DO: BE AUTHENTIC
• No need to prove how #woke you are; be authentic and don’t try to change to fit in
• That said, do your homework
• Don’t call up a source and ask him to explain the history of racism in America.
• Make a mistake? Offend someone? Be honest and apologize sincerely

DO: PROVIDE FORUMS FOR FEEDBACK
• The Arizona Republic hosts a quarterly Diversity Dialogue series with members of diverse communities. They analyze our coverage, identify mistakes, suggest story ideas, etc.
• Monitor social media comments after you post a story. People in these communities might not
feel they can call or write a letter to the editor to share feedback.
• Make sure you’re periodically auditing your own coverage as well.
