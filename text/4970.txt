EXCEL FORMULAS
It’s not as hard as it looks!
Dinah Voyles Pulver
FUNCTION = FORMULA
=SUM(A1+B1) OR =(A1+B1) To add all numbers in a row: =SUM(A1:C1)
=Max(B2:B20)
=Min(B2:B20)

TRIM Formula: =TRIM(A1) Very helpful to clean data to remove extra spaces at the front when you
need to sort a column.

PROPER =PROPER(A1) To Correct case in a column, for example to switch from all uppercase to correct
upper and lower case.

YEAR =YEAR(A1) To pull out a year from a data so you could sort all your sheets by years

To figure percent change:
Change = New – Old
=(New-Old)/Old
=(N-0)/O
TRICK: Do journalists like to do math? The answer is No
Percent total: =Part/Whole
For example, divide the number of murders in a region by region’s population to get murders per capita.

When you want to separate data out of a column:
RIGHT, LEFT, MID
Formulas: = RIGHT (CELL, number of characters), =LEFT (CELL, number of characters), =MID(CELL, start
number, number of characters).
Helpful for converting dates, especially dates that weren’t entered as a date in Excel
In the column to the right:
*Sometimes I have to experiment with these to get exactly what I want.
Yyyymmdd

=LEFT(P2,4)

=MID(P2,5,2) =RIGHT(P2,2)

(YYYYMMDD)

year

DATE

19311224

1931

12

24

new year
12/24/1931

CONCATENATE
Combines data in 2 or more cells into one cell.
You can use the =Concatenate excel formula
Or simply use the & symbol to combine cells: =A1&” “&B1
The “ “ puts a space in between the words:
Here’s one I used:

=concatenate(A1, “ “, B1)

=CONCATENATE(TRIM(A3), ", ", B3, ", ", C3)

Again, sometimes experimentation is the key to get this right.

NOTES:
Anchoring a formula so cell doesn’t change -- Use $
Don’t forget to copy and paste as values!
It’s not a formula, but to separate information in cells into separate columns, highlight the column, go to
data, then click text to column and tell it how to separate, for example by space.
