FOIA
in the
Bush Administration

Prof. Wendell Cochran
American University
June 2007

Major trends

The policy

Number of requests down
Backlog went down
 Fewer requests generate any information
 One in three requests are “non-denial denials”
 Privacy diminishing as a reason for denial
 “Executive privilege” rising
 Secrecy costs – processing costs higher

“The effective functioning of our constitutional
democracy depends upon the participation in
public life of a citizenry that is well
informed.”

Policy in action

How requests are handled

President George W. Bush’s Executive Order 13392:
“Improving Agency Disclosure of Information”

"The marching orders are now: if there's a basis
to withhold, do it.”

My new favorite “privacy case”

But privacy on decline



In Defense of Animals v. NIH
 NIH claimed “privacy” rights for a building
that houses chimpanzees.
 Fortunately, the courts disagreed, but the
group had to file suit to win



‘Executive Privilege’ on the rise

Processing costs rise

Use of Exemption 2 (Internal agency personnel rules
and practices) and Exemption 5 (inter-agency and
intra-agency documents) often called “predecisional” documents on the rise
 From 12 percent in FY01 to 34 percent in FY06
 Most of increase in Homeland Security
 These exemptions give agencies much more
discretion to decide what to withhold.

In FY ’06, only 39 percent of denials cited a
privacy exemption
 Down from nearly 80 percent in 2001

Too few appeals filed – only 6,600 in FY ’06
(out of 240,000 denials and non-denial
denials)
 Of those, about 16 percent received some
more data. Most rejections based on “no
records located.”
 But where the agency made a substantive
ruling, 32 percent of requesters got more
information

Non-denial denials

New FOIA provisions may help

Congressional
status
House bill passed in March




Broader definition of “news media”
 After Dec. 31, if an agency fails to meet time
limits, copying fees also are waived for “news
media” requestors
 The government has to pay attorneys fees in
cases where the requestor “substantially
prevailed”
 Increased access to “contractor records”

Restores and reinforces presumption of openness
Would create “FOIA Ombudsman”
Reinforces fee waivers for “media” requesters
Extends coverage to data held by contractors and other private entities
Gives requesters more ability to recover attorney’s fees if information
wrongfully withheld
Improves request tracking system
Improves data on FOIA processing

House has passed bill
Republicans/president oppose key provisions
Similar bill in Senate – not yet to floor
Veto-proof in House, but likely not in Senate

Increased attention

Get involved

News groups and other organizations
increasingly active (including IRE, ASNE)
 More research being done

Coalition of Journalists for Open Government

Sunshine Week generating attention

Traditionally reluctant as journalists
Core issue
 Sunshine Week
 Write about denials and successes
 If your state law has monitoring provisions, get the
