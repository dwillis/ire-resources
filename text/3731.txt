All search engines are not created equally. The range of algorithms used, search features offered, frequency of updating, and the pool of resources that are indexed are
all different. While no one, not even Danny Sullivan, can keep track of them all – you should find a few different resources to try when you have different search needs.
1. Are you doing a targeted search – looking for a specific item or specific type of item? You’ll want a search engine that provides greater specificity in the search
“equation” you can enter.
Northern Light - nlsearch.com (check out the Expert searches)
2. Are you just fishing? Looking for serendipitous connections? You’ll want a search engine that provides a “mind-map” of the topic that can lead you to different angles.

3. Are you looking for ideas / terms that might help you narrow down or find a new facet of a topic? Are you uncertain of the phrasing of a term? Try a “semantic”
search engine that will try to retrieve alternative terms.
