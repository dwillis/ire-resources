AGENDA

• Tolling Overview and Trends
• Project Development
• Finance and P3

TOLLING IS AN OLD ART THAT IS REGAINING POPULARITY

•

1920’s and 1930’s toll bridges
were emerging

•

1950’s ushered the turnpike
era

•

Interstate Hwy System and
Motor Fuels Tax

•

Current Emerging Toll Era

TOLLING IN THE U.S.

FUNDING OVERVIEW

•

Motor fuel taxes are declining and aren’t sustainable

•

Since highway system has matured, the need for repairs has
escalated

•

“Innovative Financing” may not create new revenue streams.
Primary sources are taxes and user fees (Tolls)

•

Many states are turning to tolling as an alternative funding
source

•

Technology advancements have made tolling more user friendly
•

Congestion pricing, HOT Lanes

TOLLING IS GAINING ACCEPTANCE

•

New revenue source

•

Traffic management tool
•

•

Managed Lanes

Technology is Increasing tolling appeal
•

Free-flowing traffic (Open Road Tolling)

•

All Electronic Toll Collection

•

Reduced capital and labor costs

•

Efficiencies in collection

ALL-ELECTRONIC TOLLING

ALL-ELECTRONIC TOLLING (AET) CHARACTERISTICS

•

Reduces congestion at plazas

•

Environmentally friendly (reduces emissions)

•

Customer convenience

•

Net Revenue Neutral/Gains (Positive ROI)

•

Reduced Capital Expenditures

•

Improved Safety/Reduced Accidents

•

Flexible Toll Rate Adjustments

•

Improved Public/Political Perception of Agency

•

Increased role of enforcement and controlling “leakage”

AET AND VIDEO BILLING

•

Transaction costs are significantly reduced with transponders

•

Must be able to read license plates with video tolling

MANAGED LANES

•

Adds traffic management as a new policy objective

•

Increases traffic throughput

•

Can alter driver behavior

•

Provides transportation Options

•

Manages multiple factors
•

Access

•

Pricing (variable)

•

Congestion (guaranteed level of service)

•

Occupancy (vehicle type)
• High Occupancy Toll Lanes (HOT Lanes)

MANAGED LANES

“A managed lane facility is one that increases freeway efficiency by packaging
various operational and design actions. Lane management operations may be
adjusted at any time to better match regional goals.”

U.S. HOT LANES PROJECTS

TOLL ROAD DEVELOPMENT

•

Many new capital projects are analyzed as potential toll projects

•

Characteristics of a good toll road

•

•

Transportation Need

•

Time savings

•

Congestion

•

Developed corridor

•

High traffic counts

•

High employment and Income

•

Few competing route

•

Positive demographics

Preliminary revenue and cost estimates are first steps

TOLL PROJECT DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

High-Level Screening
• Current pipeline projects or entire system
–
Analyze all or selected corridors
–
Incorporate ranking criteria
• Traffic levels

LEVELS OF A TRAFFIC & REVENUE STUDY

T&R FORECASTS

Key elements for evaluation
•

•

Overall demand in the corridor

•

Toll rate level and elasticity

•

Demographic data

•

Value of time

•

Travel patterns

•

Elasticity curves

•

Vehicle composition and purpose

•

Toll rate sensitivities

Amount of future growth
•

Future socio-economic forecasts

•

Development patterns

•

Origin-Destination patterns

KEY COMPONENTS OF A T&R FORECAST

T&R forecasts should be conservative and reliable
•

Increased scrutiny and risk aversion from investment community

Key considerations for a credible study:
•

Realistic tolls and calculation of a user’s willingness to pay

•

Appropriate estimate of ramp-up duration

•

Impact of potential recession/economic downturn

•

Limited reliance on future land use forecasts

•

Complexity of the transaction

TOLL ROAD FINANCING

Goal: Maximize the Amount of Debt
•

Structure a toll project financing

•

Shape debt around project cash flows

•

Debt issued as toll revenue bonds

•

Utilize multiple debt products

•

•

Current Interest Bonds (CIBs)

•

Capital Appreciation Bonds (CABs)

•

Federal TIFIA Loan

Structured with “coverage”
•

Coverage Ratio = Revenue / Debt Service

2 MAIN TYPES OF P3 DELIVERY (DBFOM)

1. Concession
•

Also called a “Revenue”, “Volume” or “Demand” Concession

•

Private sector bears “project” revenue risk
•

i.e. traffic risk for tolls

2. Availability Payment Transaction
•

Revenue repayment is tied to a pledge of public funds (not tolls)
•

•

i.e. State Transportation Trust Fund

Project can be tolled, but doesn’t have to be
