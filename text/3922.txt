IRE San Antonio – June 2013
Documents and tools for investigating nonprofits
The 990


Helpful information: basic financial information, officers, highest paid contractors,
related business with family or other associates, etc..
o Ron Campbell of the Orange County Register has a great tip sheet (#3496)
on how to decipher the 990 available at ire.org
o Some red flags to look for: 1) joint cost allocation (money spent on
fundraising that is counted towards programs – Part IX, Line 26); 2) Gifts-inkind (Schedule F)
 Where to find it:
o Guidestar.org (up to three years for free, 10 years with a premium
subscription. A premium subscription will also let you search by officers’
names)
o ProPublica’s Nonprofit Tracker (990s back to 2001 and some financial
information pulled out: http://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/)
o Some state regulators make it available online (more below)
o Ask the charity directly – the must provide 3 most recent years
 Internal Revenue Code citation: section 6104(d)(1)(a)(ii)
 If you need to cite the source: page 74 of IRS 2012 instructions for
how to fill out the 990: http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i990.pdf
The audit
 Helpful information: often includes more information than the 990 (i.e. business
with related parties, more detail about liabilities – like debt to fundraisers, etc.)
 Where to find it:
o Many states require charities to file audits, but they have different revenue
requirements. In California, for example, nonprofits that fundraise in the
state and have revenue over $2 million, must file it. In Arkansas, nonprofits
with revenue over $500,000 must file an audit. (more below)
o This website has a breakdown of what charities must file in each state:

State filings
 North Carolina Secretary of State’s website:
www.secretary.state.nc.us/csl/Search.aspx
o Contracts with fundraisers, audits, 990s, telemarketing scripts, etc.. Most upto-date resource available,
 Colorado Secretary of State’s database:
http://www.sos.state.co.us/ccsa/CcsaInquiryMain.do
o Lots of information available online. They’ll also give you their entire
relational database for a small fee.
 California Attorney General’s website:
http://rct.doj.ca.gov/MyLicenseVerification/Search.aspx?facility=Y
 It’s cumbersome, but one of the best resource’s for older documents (i.e.
application to the IRS and founding documents)

rapidly growing: http://lukerosiak.info/irs/
