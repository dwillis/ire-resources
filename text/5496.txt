Finding International
Data: Where to look in
Africa
Nana Boakye-Yiadom

Tad bit about me...

let's get
started!

Usual hurdles
Obstructions from government officials
Many of the countries without freedom of information law
Gov't officials more accountable to appointee authority than
citizens
Hiding data even though published

5 sure places to
get around it
1. International Data
2. Government/National data
3. Civil Society data sources
4. Open data sources
5. Multinational companies

International data
resources
Big International
Foundations and funders
(Eg. Bill&Mellinda Gates)
United Nations Agencies
World Bank
International Monetary
Fund

International data
sources

International open
data sources

International
open data sources

Why should I trust
this data?
It could be skewed in fovour of
the donor

It could lack context depending
on who wrote the report.

*Interrogate the data!

How about the government?
How do African governments share data?

1. Vertically - International organizations and funders
2. Horizontally - Among connected ministries, local
governments, departments and agencies

How about the government?
Don't overthink...
1. Who (Individuals, government agency) will be connected with this
kind of story?
2. Who would have been tasked to address the situation? Ministries, Local Government, Departments and Agencies
3. Who would have been concerned enough to start looking for
data? - Civil Society, Local Media, Etc.

Multinationals

Civil society open data
