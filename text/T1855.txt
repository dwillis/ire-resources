Sources and tips on nuclear, biological and chemical weapons threats

Nuclear and radiological threats:
There are two categories of threat in this arena: nuclear weapons and radiological weapons, often
referred to as “dirty bombs.”
Nuclear weapons , or bombs that get their explosive power by creating a critical chain reaction,
generally are considered a pretty remote threat. There are some concerns that bad guys could steal an
already-made weapon, most likely from the old Soviet arsenal. Perhaps a more likely scenario
involves someone obtaining enriched uranium or plutonium, the traditional nuclear weapons
materials, and fashioning a crude device on their own. Though these materials generally are subject
to pretty tight controls, there are some places around the world where they are poorly secured. With
the right amounts of those materials, someone with a decent amount of technical knowledge and
equipment might be able to build a crude atomic bomb on his own.
Radiological weapons, or dirty bombs, are bombs in which any sort of radioactive material is
attached to conventional explosives, such as TNT, and detonated to spread radioactive debris. The
immediate damage from a dirty bomb would be limited. The blast would be only as powerful as the
amount of explosives used in the device; the radioactive debris, while potentially increasing longterm risks of cancer and other illnesses among heavily exposed people, would be unlikely to cause
immediate casualties. But such a weapon probably would cause a lot of panic and could create longterm economic damage by contaminating buildings and property for years or even decades. Perhaps
the scariest radiological threat involves a terrorist attack on a nuclear power plant, perhaps by
crashing a plane into a reactor or spent fuel cache, which could spread radioactive debris over a large
area.

• NRC’s Event Notification Reports are issued daily on safety and security problems at nuclear power plants and
other facilities that handle radioactive material. The adverse event reports include everything from traffic
accidents involving radioactive material to security guards at nuclear plants failing to escort visitors to the
misadministration of radioactive isotopes in hospitals. These reports are a great way to become familiar with
security problems or adverse trends in the nuclear industry. Link to reports: http://www.nrc.gov/readingrm/doc-collections/event-status.

Chemical and biological threats:
Biological weapons essentially use living organisms -- germs -- to spread disease. They can rely on
bacteria, such as anthrax, or viruses, such as smallpox. The most worrisome biological agents are
those that are communicable, meaning they can be passed from person to person.
Chemical weapons rely on man-made and naturally occurring poisons. They generally fall into two
categories: nerve agents (sarin, VX, etc.), which in many cases are derived from the same chemical
family as common pesticides; and so-called “blister” agents (mustard gas) which cause
incapacitating burns to the skin and, if inhaled, lungs.
Russia maintains vast stocks of chemical and biological agents inherited from the old Soviet arsenal.
Some of the material is stored in actual weapons (artillery shells, etc.); some is stored in bulk (50
gallon drums, etc.).
The United States got out of the chemical and biological weapons business about three decades ago,
though the government still does research on bio and chemical defense at several military and
civilian laboratories. The United States and Russia both are committed to destroying all their
chemical weapons agents under the Chemical Weapons Convention, though neither country is on
target to meet its commitments for getting rid of existing stocks.
