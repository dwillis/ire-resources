Uncovered Angle of Guns
Tip Sheet by Brian Freskos

Know your guns: AK-47s don’t exist
●

AK-47 was a designation given to several prototype riﬂes that were never issued
○

●

●

Acceptable terms: AK-47-style or AK-47-type riﬂe

AR-15 is a Colt trademark
○

Other companies produce AR-15 variants (e.g., Bushmaster XM15-E2S used at Sandy Hook)

○

Acceptable terms: AR-15-style or AR-15-type

○

“AR” stands for ArmaLite Riﬂe, not “Assault Riﬂe”

When police say an AR-15 was used, ask make and model

Know Your Guns: Magazines vs. Clips
●

Magazines are
ammunition feeding
devices used in most
modern firearms.

●

Revolvers, however, rely
not on a magazine but
on a revolving cylinder

Know Your Guns: Magazines vs. Clips
●

The term “magazine” is not
interchangeable with the term
“clip”

●

Clips are devices used to store
rounds as a single unit for
insertion into the magazine of a
gun

●

For more on the difference
between clips and magazines,
see this write-up

Know Your Guns: Rounds vs. Bullets
●

A bullet is only one part of a full
round, aka “cartridge”

●

Casing typically ejected upon ﬁring,
though not with revolvers

●

Guns, or magazines, are loaded with
rounds, but people are shot with
bullets

Story Idea: Ammunition Capacity
●

Studies show that shooters equipped with higher capacity magazines inflict more
casualties

●

Several states have banned high-capacity magazines, typically defined as those
holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition

●

Some local law enforcement agencies compile data on the capacity of firearms
recovered from crime scenes

●

You can request this data via a public records request and use it to analyze
whether the capacity of firearms has increased or decreased in your area

●

Some things to be cautious about:
○

The ammunition capacity reflected in the data may include the number of rounds that could fit into the
magazine as well as the one that can fit in the chamber of the firearm

○

If you want to analyze magazine capacity only, limit your analysis to only those firearms that use
magazines, i.e., not revolvers

Ammunition Capacity Sources:
●

For an overview of state laws around magazine capacity, see Giffords

●

For more on guns and cartridges, see this write-up

●

Mother Jones has done some great reporting on the use of high-capacity
magazines in mass shootings

●

For an example of the kind of reporting you can do in your own community,
see this Washington Post analysis about the drop in high-capacity magazine
recoveries during the federal gun ban. See also this reporting from The Trace

●

See this academic paper on the use of high-capacity magazines in crime
guns

Know your guns: Ammunition Calibers
●

Caliber is a measurement of a bullet’s diameter, either in metric increments or
fractions of an inch.

●

Higher caliber bullets, particularly .40 and .45, wreak greater havoc on human
bodies

Story Idea: Changes in Ammunition Caliber
●

Manufacturers have produced
greater numbers of
high-caliber handguns and
marketed them as ideal
self-defense weapons

●

Growing number of
high-caliber handguns in legal
market = Growing number of
high-caliber handguns in
illegal market

Story Idea: Changes in Ammunition Caliber
●

Many local law enforcement agencies collect data on the caliber of firearms
recovered from crime scenes

●

You can request this data and use it to analyze changes in firearm calibers

●

The ATF publishes annual reports on the calibers of guns traced in each state each
year.

●

○

Manufacturing info available through Firearms Manufacturers and Export Report

○

Crime gun info available through Firearms Trace Data

If you really want to get into the physics that makes some bullets deadlier
than others, see The Trace’s reporting here, here and here.

Collecting Data
●

In addition to caliber and ammunition capacity, many local law enforcement
agencies collect other data regarding crime guns recovered in their
jurisdictions, including:
○
○
○
○
○
○

●

Make and Model, which can be used to determine where crime guns were manufactured
Serial Number, which can be used to track weapons and link stolen firearms to crimes
Firearm Type (Pistol, Rifle, Shotgun, etc.), which can be used to examine trends in firearm
types over time
Firearm Category (Revolver, Semi-automatic, Pump Action, etc.), which can aid in analyzing
magazine capacity
The Offense involving each firearm, which can help you narrow down and report out stories on
guns used in homicides and other violent crimes
The Case Number associated with each firearm, which can help in requesting the police
reports and other records for particular cases

Read your department’s policies and procedures manual to see what kind of
data they collect and where it is stored

Know your guns: Physical Markings
●

When trying to piece
together the life of a
particular gun, the
physical markings can
help add pieces to the
puzzle

●

Some departments will
supply a photo or allow
you to take one

Story Idea: Gun Store Burglaries
●

By law, gun stores must report thefts to federal AND local authorities

●

Local authorities log stolen guns into the National Crime Information Center

●

If one of the stolen guns is later recovered, the recovering agency contacts the
local authorities to remove gun from NCIC

●

If you request the police report associated with the burglary, you can ﬁnd out
where the stolen guns were recovered and use that information to request records
related to the crimes involving the stolen guns

Story Idea: Gun Store Burglaries
Request the police report to find out where the stolen guns were recovered….

Story Idea: Gun Store Burglaries
…. Then go to the recovering jurisdiction and request police and court records
related to the case:

Gun Store Burglaries Sources:
●

The ATF compiles annual reports on the number of guns reported stolen by
gun stores and other federal firearms licensees, or FFLs. See here.

●

When reporting on gun store break-ins, ask about the store’s security
measures. In most states, stores are not required to adopt any sort of
security. For a listing of state laws, see Giffords

●

For an example of the kind of reporting you can do on gun stores, see this
report from The Trace and The New Yorker

Other Helpful Sources:
●

ATF publishes a great guidebook on firearm verification that provides an
overview of laws every gun reporter should know.

●

Small Arms Survey publishes a useful guide for understanding and identifying
ﬁrearms

●

Conﬂict Armament Research publishes reports tracking weapons recovered in
conﬂict-aﬀected areas
