Compstat USA
How a revolutionary policing model
led to unintended consequences

NYPD: Where it all started
- In 1994, NYPD began
using Compstat, a
performance management
system intended to hold
police officers and
commanders accountable.
- It was the brainchild of
Jack Maple, former NYPD
Deputy Police
Commissioner

Jack Maple

How does Compstat work?
The founding principle of Compstat is
based the acronym “IDEA.”
I - intelligence, timely and accurate
D - deployment, rapid
E - enforcement, narrowly focused
A - assessment, relentless follow-up

Compstat in action
- Every day, officers file incident
reports on crimes that occur on
their beat.
- The information from those
reports is entered into a database,
including time, date, place and
crime classification.
- That data is what drives
Compstat: each incident becomes
a dot on an interactive map so that
commanders can track crime
almost in real time.

Compstat in action
- The crimes can be tracked so that weekly, monthly
and year-to-date totals can be compared to previous
time periods.
- Once a week, one of the police bureaus is invited
downtown to headquarters. Several precinct
commanders must make presentations and then
explain why crime is up or down on their watch.
- They must articulate an understanding of the
problems affecting their precinct. At NYPD, squad
commanders have been demoted or reassigned for a
failure to do this.

Why Compstat works
- In short, it’s the “A” in IDEA: “Assessment,
relentless follow-up” - the back and forth
- Tracking crimes and deploying officers to hot
spots is smart policing.
- Holding commanders accountable for not
properly addressing high levels of criminal
activity in their areas is smart policing.

Bad data undermines it all
- In short, it’s the “I” in
IDEA: “intelligence, timely
and accurate”
- If the raw crime data is
inaccurate, the whole
process quickly falls apart.
- The result: police have an
incomplete picture of crime
on the maps. This affects
deployment decisions too.

What's at stake?
- Favorable crime
numbers are often
touted by police chiefs
and mayors.

Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn after
his first-year crime drops are
announced in 2009.

- It's like a community
report card. When crime
is down, residents feel
safer and good about
their city or county.

What's the reality?
- There is tremendous pressure on police
departments and the mayor’s office to keep
crime down.
- Humans tend to respond to performance
management systems like CompStat, but
those incentivized models can lead to
unintended consequences.

Survey finds widespread
manipulation at NYPD

John Eterno

Eli Silverman

- In 2012, criminologists John Eterno
and Eli Silverman conducted a survey
of more than 4,000 retired NYPD
officers of all ranks.
- They broke the retirees into 3
distinct time periods: those who
retired before 1995, those who retired
from 1995 to 2001 and those who
retired after 2002 when Raymond
Kelly took over.

The findings of the survey
- The researchers found the percentage of
retirees who said they were pressured to
downgrade serious crimes to minor crimes
more than doubled over the 3 eras.
- Also, the percentage of retirees who said they
manipulated crime reports to make numbers
look better or who purposely didn’t take reports
to suppress crime increased significantly over
the 3 eras.

How to juke your stats

Downgrade offenses from the
big seven to those that don’t
count toward your crime rate.

●Murder
●Rape
●Robbery
●Agg Assault

●Burglary
●Theft
●Auto theft

UCR Handbook, Page 25:
●“The category Aggravated
Assault…includes assaults resulting
from the use or threatened use of any
object as a weapon in which serious
injury does or could result. The weapons
in this category include, but are not
limited to, Mace, pepper spray, clubs,
bricks, jack handles, tire irons, bottles, or
other blunt instruments used to club or
beat victims.”

Aggravated assaults:
●If someone gets beaten with a club, brick or
bottle, just classify it as a simple assault – even
though UCR guidelines say otherwise.

One technique…

In 2007, Dallas police began counting assaults
differently. Only when weapons such as bottles,
bricks, pipes caused serious injury were assaults
considered aggravated.

What happened to business
burglaries in 2008? You can bet it
was a reporting policy change.

Burglaries
●If someone kicks down a door, busts a lock or
uproots an ATM, but gets scared away before
stealing anything, just call it vandalism.

UCR Handbook, Page 29:
●“A forcible entry or unlawful entry in
which no theft or felony occurs but acts
of vandalism, malicious mischief, etc.
are committed is not classified as a
burglary provided investigation clearly
established that the unlawful entry was
for a purpose other than to commit a
felony or theft.”

a big impact on the black market for
stolen property, reducing the
incentive for thieves to steal."

Dallas police Chief David Brown

Make things harder to report
“I’m sorry, sir. To report a shoplifting,
you’ll need to go online, print out a
form, and then send it by U.S. mail it
to police headquarters.”

A guide to scrutinizing
your local police
department’s crime stats
By Ben Poston
Los Angeles Times

- The FBI's audits
are a joke
- Many states
don't do audits
and city
comptroller’s
rarely do.
- Some depts.
don't even audit
themselves.
- So basically no
one is checking
the cops.

That’s where we come in
- Since no one is
policing the police, it
falls to us.
- Here are some tips I
learned while
investigating the
Milwaukee Police
Department in 2012.

Milwaukee Police - A case study
- After Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn
took over in 2008 we heard constant talk
of inaccurate crime numbers.
- Everyone, from beat cops to
supervisors, from residents to city
councilmen, had all expressed doubts
about the integrity of MPD’s data.
- Yet, crime dropped for 4 consecutive
years.
- We tried to do a 2-week spot check in
2010, but MPD wanted thousands of
dollars in fees and said it would take 9
months to redact the records.

Police Chief Ed Flynn

What I did in Milwaukee
- Obtained a copy of the DA's Case
Management Database. I also got a copy of the
FBI crime data that the police dept. reported to
the state.
- I cleaned and joined these two data sets. I
looked for cases that were marked as simple
assaults that should have been coded as
aggravated assaults. I had to read thousands of
criminal complaints.
- Then I shared my findings with FBI experts

Here’s what I found
- First story: MPD
under-reported more
than 500 aggravated
assaults in a 3-year
period, meaning
they didn't get
counted in the city's
crime rate.
- Another 800 cases
followed the same
pattern.

Clerks changed codes
- Clerks routinely
changed weapon
codes, which allowed
crimes to be
misreported.
- This came from
interview with crime
stats people and a
check of paper police
reports.

Blowback
- Police Chief Ed
Flynn held several
press conferences
and went on talk
radio to bash me.
- It was tough, but
they never
challenged any of
our findings.

Impact: Audit
shows 5,300
aggravated
assaults
misreported
Flynn testifies to Public Safety Committee

- MPD launched an internal audit and found more than 5,300
aggravated assaults were under-reported during a six-year
time.
- As a result, the total number of violent crimes during that
time was 10% higher than previously reported. (Agg assaults
more than 20% higher)

More impact
- Violent crime was up
9.4% in 2012, driven by
a 33% jump in agg
assaults, and a 48%
spike in DV agg
assaults.

What I wish I did
- Go straight to the source.
- Request a copy of your police department's
automated reporting system.
- You should be able to ask for the fields on the
face sheet of the report.
- Your key fields are the police incident report
number, suspect/victim names, FBI crime code,
weapon codes, time/date/place, and a short
narrative that describes the elements of the
offense.

What I eventually did
- That way, you can
simply read the short
narrative and see if it
matches the crime code
for each offense.
- You can save yourself
time with text filters.
- This is the approach I
took for a story on
burglaries being
miscoded as thefts.

What you can do
- You can and should check the integrity of your
local police department’s crime stats.
- Request records directly from them and
compare crime codes to narrative of each case.
- Burglary and aggravated assault are the two
areas most ripe for misclassification.
- For burglary, look at vandalism, criminal
damage to property, criminal trespass or theft
from building.
- Find crime coding experts to evaluate cases
