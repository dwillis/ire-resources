Managing the CAR story

Before There is a Story
Editing the CAR story begins before the story does. An editor doesn’t
need to know the data as well as the reporter does, but he or she needs
to have a thorough understanding of it.
• Experiment with the data: run some queries, do some sorts,
whatever’s appropriate. (If you don’t know how, have the
reporter show you). (But it’s better if you know how).
• Know what it contains – and what it doesn’t.
• Ask lots of questions.
• Check the numbers against paper records, even if the reporter
already has.
• Read and understand the record layout.
• Read the open records requests. Know what you’re reporter is
asking for, and what he or she isn’t getting.
• Figure out the pitfalls early on. Make sure you’ve got what you
think you’ve got.
• Be as skeptical of the data, and of any results your reporter gets,
as you would be of any source. Never forget that data is just stuff
that people typed up.

Broaden Your Horizons
Reporters who spend a lot of time with a database can become
addicted. There’s always one more query or regression to run. You
must be their 12‐step program.
• Make sure your reporter understands that a data set is a source.
One source. And we don’t do one‐source stories.
• Force them to put the keyboard down and pick up the phone.
• Better yet, force them to actually go outside.
• Treat the data as a tip sheet. Make sure that the reporter is
finding the people behind the numbers.
• Remain skeptical of the data. Make sure a reporting plan exists
that will truth‐test what you think you’ve found.
• Go to experts. When appropriate, find independent voices that
can evaluate the paper’s analysis.
• Go to the source, and go early. There is no point in waiting to
unveil your results at the 11th hour to the agency or individual
involved. If you’ve found something good, telling them about it
won’t make it go away. If you’ve made a mistake, better to know
sooner than later.
Be the Editor
Even if you’re not a CAR expert – and you probably aren’t, and that’s
OK – you’re still the editor. Don’t ever cede that roll because your
reporter is the expert with the numbers.
• Make the reporter explain everything they’ve done
• Make sure you can explain why this matters to someone not
involved in the project

• Help the reporter come up with a reporting plan that incorporates
the data but isn’t shackled by it.
• Help the reporter remain organized. As data collects, paralysis can
ensue.
• Don’t give up. Just as in life, data analysis results aren’t always
black‐and‐white, good‐or‐evil. In fact, if the results look too good,
be skeptical.
• Think graphics early, and often. Number‐heavy stories often
require more visual assistance to make sense. If the story has a
mapping component, meet with a graphics artist early to figure
out the best way to display it.
• Think Web early, and often. Number‐heavy stories can see their
impact rise dramatically online. Consider what can be done
interactively with the data, and remember that this takes time to
put together.
• Think photos early. Illustrating a data story can be tough. But
photographers think visually and often have ideas you won’t.
The Story
The key thing to remember is that this is a story, not a collection of
data. That sounds obvious, but it can be hard to do.
• Find anecdotes from the data and report them out.
• Make sure you keep the numbers to a dull roar in the story. Push
much of the data into graphics/Web elements
• Don’t forget to show why we care. Sometimes reporters and
editors get so excited by their findings that they believe everyone
will share their elation. They won’t. So you have cool numbers.
So?

• Simplify.
• Humanize the thing.
• Every rule that applies to a non‐data drive story still applies:
storytelling, pacing, quotes, story arc, etc.
• Admit what you don’t know
Bulletproofing
It’s always important to exhaustively fact check any in‐depth story. But
it’s especially crucial when the story is based on internal analysis as
opposed to an outside expert’s work.
• Go through the data analysis process step by step. Ask questions
every step of the way. If you don’t understand, ask until you do.
• Make sure the analysis wasn’t designed solely to get the desired
result. Make sure that “devil’s advocate” queries/tests were done.
• Do your own math and apply your own logic. Do the results add
up?
• Make sure the story says what the numbers say.
• Check carefully for any areas in which the story exceeds the
analysis’ reach.
• Run every conclusion by the agency/people involved. Be ready to
show them how you came to your results. Sharing is good. Really.
• If you used a consultant or expert early on, run all your
conclusions by them, in exactly the way you plan to present them.
• Make sure each graphic/Web element tells the story accurately
and isn’t misleading, even though it only shows part of the
picture.
