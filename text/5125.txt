OVERSIGHT/Where to find supplemental filings
There are many government agencies with regulatory authority over nonprofits.
Each may have supplemental information such as warning letters, revocation
letters, annual financial statements, correspondence and more.
Yet oversight differs between states.
To find which agencies in your state have oversight, Google:
“[your state]” + “charities” + “filing” + site:.gov
--Scan through the separate URLs to determine oversight.
P.S. For California, major agencies are the:
-Cal. Office of the Attorney General
-Cal. Secretary of State
-Cal. Franchise Tax Board
-IRS
