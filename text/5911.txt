Use Audio to Break Assumptions and Create Empathy

Why the podcast format worked for breaking down this criminal case
●
●

First, identify a need​. Even after massive amounts of media attention, still a critical gap in
coverage and understanding: No, but seriously, ​how ​did he get away with this?

Audio puts us in the ROOM for it. Let us feel like we are the ones making the call, that we could
have missed it too.

●

Made time & emotional commitment for the audience clear from the outset: limited series, with
a value proposition in each episode.

●

Pilot: here’s why you don’t know this story, here’s why you should care, here’s who’s gonna tell
it, here’s how it’s going to feel while you’re listening (not consistently horrible!)

●

Gave us the space to tell a super complete picture of how he was able to get away for 20 years…
one story at a time.

●

The level of intimacy* with the audience with a sensitive subject matter.

●

The level of exposure for survivors is lower than video but comes to life better than print.

●

Got away with language/content we probably couldn’t on the radio – including calling him
Larry.

Tips for building structure/narrative in investigative podcast
●

Figure out what your project is NOT about.

●

Find a North Star so you don’t get lost (as easily). “You could have missed this too.”

●

Tell one story per episode.

●

Start with a story map, but then let the best audio guide you. Be willing to course-correct.

●

Once the case is closed a potential trove of audio options is available.
○

2016 interrogation was played in court – but we didn’t see the 2014 interview until
months after he was sentenced. The arrest and booking videos we didn’t have until the
case was closed. We weren’t able to get the video but we did appeal to the president of
MSU to get tape of the MSUPD’s raid on his house. We got police reports from previous
cases that we wouldn’t have been able to get otherwise.

Tips for dealing with sensitive sources/sexual assault survivors
●

Level of familiarity can be super important
○

Why should they trust you?

○

Don’t try to sell them, pitch them with clarity, so they know up front what they’re getting
into.

●

Paint the entire human: funny, weird, complicated, specific. ​Ex: When Rachael Denhollander
was pregnant with her third kid, she stockpiled the garage freezer with pre-made meals for an
entire year. Tells you, this is a woman who is gonna get shit done.

●

Put them in a position of power/authority ​before ​you get into the abuse. Makes them real people,
more relatable for the listener (this could happen to me, etc.) ​Ex: Rachael in the kitchen, serene

amid chaos, laughing with her husband. Or: Kyle in Chicago, living a successful, normal adult life,
recalling childhood from a distance - she’s no longer that kid in the basement.
●

Don’t make survivors have to tell details of abuse unless it is ​necessary ​for the story. Ask

yourself: what purpose does this serve? Explain those reasons and the context to the survivor.
●

Look for micro-collaborations in a survivor’s story. It’s what the cops do. Family, friends,
lawyer, a police officer. Helps make the story bulletproof and sometimes get a clearer
understanding of what happened. Memories can be missing or distorted if only talking to one
person.

●

Offer to spend time or break bread with them before or after hard interviews. Be flexible on
location of interview.

●

Use DART Center for Journalism and Trauma as a resource. They make great TIPSHEETS!

●

Treat them like humans: let them know ahead of time about what fact checking may be needed,
who else you’re talking to, etc. Don’t ghost them post interview. And gave a really solid
rundown once the script was finalized. (Control and trust is key for most survivors.)

●

Figure out your boundaries ahead of time: when you build a relationship with a survivor over
years, how will you maintain professional ethics when it gets tricky?
