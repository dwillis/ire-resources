Writing the investigative narrative
Maria Carrillo, assistant managing editor/enterprise, Tampa Bay Times

What is a narrative?
“Chronology with meaning” - Jon Franklin
True narratives:
Lend themselves to the form (chronology, character, tension, arc)
Often fueled by simple question
Powered by telling moments and details
Alternate between show and tell
Story dictates form
Must have investigative results and a way to illustrate the findings
How good a story?
Look for verbs, not nouns
Consider:
Importance / local impact / urgency / surprise / muckraking /
human interest / storytelling / emotional impact / historical weight / novelty
Reporting for story
Explain yourself
Be patient / quiet / listen for what they say and don’t say / how they say what they do say
Ask about thoughts, inner monologues
Extend timeline
Don’t be afraid to go back again. And again. And again.
Peel back layers
Look for sensory details (especially smells and sounds)
Zoom in and out
Look for scenes / dialogue / records
“Cast” for characters, people who are accessible
Organize by topic, not by source
Focus
What’s the one word?

Framing
Know where you’re going to end up
Ground your readers
Make the story move
Build momentum
Inspire emotion
Roadmap
Strong start / strong finish
Marry scenes and summary
Be selective
Build to a payoff
Think in terms of chapters
Foreshadow
Reward the reader
Story structure
a-b-a-b-a-b-a (alternate between scenes and summary)
Straight chronology (tightest time frame possible)
Start almost at the climax, then turn to the beginning
Write a summary, then turn and find a starting point (imagine a martini glass)
Make a promise
Rise up
Editing for story
Make sure everyone is on the same page before writing begins
Excise: flabby quotes / jargon / echoes / empty phrases / clauses / needless attribution /
passive voice / redundancies / long titles / unnecessary qualifiers
Add: clarity / specificity / periods / subjects / variety (sentence length) / strong verbs
Read out loud
Maestro, please
Involve newsroom stakeholders - early and often
Share findings and focus
Spend time on the big words
