Humanizing Data
Andy Lehren, The New York Times
NICAR Conference, Denver 2016

We don’t tell data
 We are journalists. We tell stories.
 People absorb information differently.
 Information resonates for readers and

viewers in different ways.
 Some are visual. Love charts.
 Some prefer big picture expert quotes.
 Some though focused narratives about
people.

How did we get the story
 We’ve heard a great example of

something and want to use data to go
bigger.

 That puts us on a good start to humanize

a story

 Or we use data to find stories … our

journey is likely different

Casting
 May sound offputting
 If what you found in the data is right,

there are ways to make this more than
about numbers
 The typical. The outliers.
 What is the core of your story?
 How do you do it?
 Examples might be in your data
 More often, you’re going elsewhere

Don’ts
 Humanizing may not mean just any

anecdote
 Worst are anecdotes that do not relate to
the theme

How do you find elements for
humanizing
 May not be in the data set that got you

there to your story
 All the other resources and tools we’ve
developed as reporters.
 Other databases, lawsuits, traditional
sources, documents
 Social

Why this is not just
anecdote fishing
 Truth testing your hypothesis
 Not seeking confirmation bias
 Look for surprises that push you further

Make us care
 What’s the harm, what’s the foul, why

should we care

The journey
 Taking your audience on the journey as

you go through your investigation

The details we can all relate to
 When you cannot get people
