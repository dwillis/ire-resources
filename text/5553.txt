Prying Loose Public Records
Tisha Thompson @tishaESPN

Names Matter
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA, FOI, FOIL)
Public Information Act (PIA)

Open Records Act (CORA, OPRA, APRA)
Sunshine Request

So for simplicity’s sake...I’m just going to use FOIA as a generic term

First...if you can...avoid the FOIA at all costs
Always start with a phone call…
They may tell you exactly what (and what not) to ask for - speeds up process
Or they may just give it to you

You may get more than you expected...you may get less...but at least it’s
something, especially in breaking news. You can FOIA the rest later.
Because if you call, you may get it in the next few hours or days…
Whereas a FOIA in some places can take weeks, months or years

Writing the FOIA: Things I Learned the Hard Way
Limit the FOIA to what you really want - don’t go too broad
Carmageddon II (aka The Perils of an Email FOIA):
https://www.nbcwashington.com/investigations/Carmageddon-II-Behind-theMeltdown-378166211.html
If using a keyword search, think of what other possible context that same
word might show up…
Google alerts, weather alerts, ads, listserv blasts, newspaper digests

Words within words: “Seat” is a very different thing than “Seattle”

Things I Learned the Hard Way
Give them specific dates, (email) or (mailing) addresses, keywords, other
information that will speed up the search
“From January 1, 2017 until the date this FOIA is processed.”
Think about privacy and how to get around it…
Don’t ask for Personal Identifiable Information (PII) if you don’t need it
Medical records if it involves more than a dozen people
Maybe ask for zipcodes instead of street addresses, etc.

Things I Learned the Hard Way
If you’re requesting data, make
sure you also ask for supporting
documentation that will help you
understand that data
Always ask for the Record Layout
And the Coding Guide

How to Get What You Really Want
You will always start with a government employee who is totally overworked
and generally exhausted by their job. Being a jerk won’t do you much good.
Honey tends to work better than vinegar. But you have to be the bee…

Annoy the crud out of them - keep buzzing by calling & emailing for updates
Keep two types of logs:
A log of every FOIA you’ve requested (create alerts for when a FOIA is due)
SUPER IMPORTANT! A detailed log of every interaction you’ve had on each
FOIA request

How Much to Pay?
I’ve received estimates from $0 to more than $1 million dollars for records
I’m pretty sure I’ve never paid more than $200

You will sometimes get an astronomical estimate - it may be the agency’s way
of weeding out people…
Which means you need to negotiate the price
You’re not just fighting for yourself - you’re fighting for everyone else trying to
gain access to records, especially those who don’t have any money to spare

How Much to Pay?
Do they have a fee schedule? Will they waive fees since you’re a journalist?
Can they send the documents to you electronically? (Yes. Yes they can.)

Do the math - how much would an employee get paid an hour based on the
fees they’re accessing? Would it make that employee the highest paid
employee in the government?
Can you reduce the scope of your request?
Can you talk to someone who can explain why the complexity of what they
need to do? (‘Cause chances are good it’s not actually very complex at all)

Reality Check: Local & State Governments
How long do they really have before they must ACKNOWLEDGE your request?
It really varies from state to state…

https://www.rcfp.org/open-government-guide
https://www.rcfp.org/maryland-open-government-guide/v-procedureobtaining-records/b-how-long-wait/1-statutory-regulatoryThat is not the same thing as actually giving you what you want

Reality Check: Local & State Governments
If it’s past the deadline and you’re not getting any answers…
Call or write a formal letter to head of the agency. They sometimes
understand the optics better than the worker bees. Explain what you’re
requesting and how the law has already been violated.
Tweet about the delay
Write a news story about the delay that explains why readers should care

Reality Check: Federal Government
The Federal government has 20 days to acknowledge your FOIA
Many agencies have created a “Multi-track Processing” system

Simple = 1-5 Days
Normal = 20 Days

Complex = 20+ Days
Even my simplest FOIAs, including requests for previously disclosed material,
have all been deemed “Complex.”

Reality Check: Federal Government
I generally work under the assumption that I will not receive a response to a
federal FOIA for at least one to two years. If you’re not going to care about this
story in a year or two - look for a different way of getting the information.

National Park Service = 2-3 Months
Federal Trade Commission = 3-6 months
Department of Agriculture = 2 Years
Department of State = 6+ Years

Excessive Delay Appeal
Under the federal statute, you have the right to “administratively appeal
excessive, undue delays. Such appeals may, although not always, have the
effect of speeding up your request (especially if you are truly intent on filing a
lawsuit because of the delay and let the agency know as much).”

A Case Study: Diplomatic Drivers
August 2008
Filed a FOIA with the Department of State asking for “A list of driving violations
and/or accident reports submitted to the Diplomatic Motor Vehicles Office
from January 1, 2003 until the present day.”
2008-2014
I called and received updates that my request was making its way through the
queue. To put it in perspective, we went from the iPhone 1 to the iPhone 6.
Oh! And I had a baby who had entered kindergarten in that amount of time.

A Case Study: Diplomatic Drivers
May 2014
State just stopped picking up the phone entirely. The OIG would later report
that State had a record number of requests and a massive backlog.
So in a rare move for me, I starting tweeting @StateDept...

LOOK WHAT SHOWED UP OUT OF THE BLUE!!!

A Case Study: Diplomatic Drivers
I got last names, types of violations, some dates and some states. But I didn’t
know where they got pulled over, how fast they were going, how drunk they
were or even their first names or what they did for their embassies.

I filed multiple FOIAs with all of our local police departments requesting the
citation or tickets issued to the names and dates I now had on my list.
But wait! Under MD, DC and VA law, tickets fall under “privacy” and
“investigatory” exemptions
https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1363802-diplomatic-driversfairfax-county-police-foia.html

A Case Study: Diplomatic Drivers
But I got them anyway. It was just a lot more work.
Police don’t release tickets - but the courthouses do.

I visited every courthouse in our viewing area, searching each name
individually. It took several weeks, as I had a list with several hundred names
on it, and many records had to be pulled from court archives because they
were so old. I also discovered many of the names were actually repeat
offenders that weren’t listed in my State Department FOIA.

A Case Study: Diplomatic Drivers
At the same time, I filed a FOIA appeal with the Department of State.
State only sent me records from 2002 until 2010 because I wrote “from
January 1, 2002 until the present day” instead of “until the day this FOIA is
processed.” By default, my records were already four years old by the time I
got them (which is, of course, an entire presidential administration).
State also denied me a large portion of the requested information based on
the “Foreign Relations” exemption outlined in Executive Order 13526, which is
supposed to protect homeland security, not cover up for bad diplomatic
behavior.

A Case Study: Diplomatic Drivers
My appeal letter: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1363803diplomatic-drivers-state-dept-foia-appeal-letter.html

I wrote the letter by cobbling together letters written by other journalism
organizations: https://www.rcfp.org/federal-foia-appeals-guide/sampleappeal-letters-and-templates

A Case Study: Diplomatic Drivers
A panel of three former ambassadors reviewed my appeal. I eventually
received records about six months later containing new information, but the
appeals panel also redacted information previously provided, like names.
