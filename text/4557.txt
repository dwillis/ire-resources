Search and Set Alerts for Public Records
Retrieving and searching through public records is the lifeblood of investigative reporting, yet it can be painful. Worse, if
you’re a business journalist, is missing the
scoop because a particular disclosure was
filed 10 minutes after you searched for it.
Sqoop is a new (beta) web service that lets
journalists search and set alerts for records from public data sources. Right now,
Sqoop aggregates information from the
SEC, the U.S. Patent Office and the federal
court system, and will be adding others soon.

How it works
Sqoop looks like a search engine. If you’re interested in information about companies, executives or technologies, for example, simply type in “Microsoft,”
“Sergey Brin,” or “wearable technology,” and Sqoop will quickly return results from all the data sources it tracks.
So a search for “Microsoft” would show
you all of the latest SEC filings, patent
applications and grants, and federal
docket information about the company.
Most importantly for some journalists is the ability
to save these searches as alerts so that whenever
there is a new filing, Sqoop will trigger an alert so
the reporter can jump on the story.
Sqoop has been in beta for fewer than six months,
but already reporters from some of the most respected publications in the country use the service.
These reporters are generating stories every week,
oftentimes ahead of the competition.
