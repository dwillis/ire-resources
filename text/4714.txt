That’s what the money pays for

But first...

Last week’s examples:

Some details:
● This initiative isn’t even on the ballot yet
● Only sent to my husband
● Group not registered with SoS
● What are the stories here?

All sorts of messages
● Digital ads
● Radio
● Robocalls
● Fliers
● TV ads
● More?

TV ads: biggest fed expense

State/local TV ads, too
● Statewide candidates
● Ballot initiatives
● Even legislative/local races

Where to get info?
● Stations.fcc.gov
● Your cable company
● politicaladarchive.org
● independent expenditure filings

FCC
● Stations must file contracts for political ads
● Cable TV will soon be required to file
● State and local issue campaigns aren’t
covered by federal law

But… an example

If you’re lucky…

Caveats
● Track contracts, invoices or both?
● Stations are inconsistent in when they file
● Some stations remove docs
● Filings can be difficult to figure out
● It’s a lot of data entry

Political TV Ad Archive

Presidential only for now
● Database on when ads ran
● Capture of all ads
● Videos
● Analysis - pro, con, etc.; issues covered

Caveats
● Collecting not just paid ads but also ads run
on news programs
● No pricing info
● No state/local ads at this point

The “magic words”
● Campaigns aren’t the only messengers
● Super PACs, 527s, nonprofits all play
● Non-campaign ads often employ different
tactics because of different rules

Examples:
● Vote for/against
● Support/reject
● Elect/defeat

Instead of that, this:
● Call X and tell her Y
● Nonprofits (501(c)(4)s) are the prime
example
● They don’t have to report the same way - or
at all
● Read the fine print/search for the group

Tracking non-candidates
● 527s - does your state require reporting?
● If not, the IRS requires quarterly filings
● Examples: Democratic & Republican
governors associations
● Who are local donors?
● Who are they paying locally?

An RGA 527 example...

Even federal Super PACs

Las Cruces mayoral race

Independent spending
● Does your state or city require reporting?
● How specific? (CO is, NM isn’t)
● What are the deadlines?

Donors

Spending - how much info?

How to find the messages?
● Social media
○ monitor hashtags
○ recruit help there

● Crowdsourcing
○ Recruit your audience
○ Use voter registration lists

● Opposition campaigns

My fave so far this year
