2016 Reporter’s Guide to Using QCEW Data
This document provides single page tip sheets on using BLS
Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) data to
provide information and help on topics such as:
 Quick read on an unfamiliar location
 Local incidence of an industry
 Local concentration of an industry
 Local reflection of national trends
 Employment and wages in hurricane flood zones
 QCEW Data Viewer: county, MSA, state, and national data by
industry
 QCEW Open Data Access: Create your own data app or
database

Quick read on an unfamiliar location
QCEW publishes industry employment and wage series for every county in the
country. This may make it seem that QCEW data can be difficult to work with
under deadline due to the huge number of series available (over a thousand NAICS
industries for each and every county). Because of this, QCEW is constantly
working to improve the user experience.
After Hurricane Katrina, the QCEW County High Level Spreadsheet was
developed to help reporters get a quick read on an unfamiliar location. Available
here, it provides industry detail at the QCEW Supersector levels and higher level
for each county, MSA, state, and for the nation. Restricting the industry detail to
QCEW Supersector Levels and above results in a manageable number of industries
for users in a hurry.
The QCEW State and County Map Application was developed to provide the
same high level information in a web application with data maps and sortable
tables. It is a fully vetted product. It is listed under the beta directory to increase its
exposure.
QCEW Data Viewer is a web application that provides tabular access to all QCEW
data for 2012 to the present. It provides much more industry detail than the high
level spreadsheet or the map application.

Local incidence of an industry
Where are the fertilizer plants? QCEW received this question after the April 2013
explosion in West, Texas.
QCEW publishes establishment counts (as well as employment and wages) at the
finest level of industry detail (NAICS 6-digit) for every county. Comparable data
are available at the MSA, State and national levels. QCEW publishes this detail for
over 3,000 counties. All levels of industry detail are available, from NAICS 6-digit
up to total, all industries.
The best tool for accessing QCEW data is the QCEW Data Viewer.
To see the complete list of counties where an industry exists, check the box labeled
“Show records with suppressed employment and wages.” There were 887 fertilizer
manufacturing establishments in the second quarter of 2015. Click here to see a
QCEW Data Viewer table of the counties with these establishments.

Local concentration of an industry
Where is industry X concentrated? How dependent is my area on industry Y?
QCEW can answer this question via the use of Location Quotients (LQ). This is
made possible by the great amount of industry detail published by QCEW at the
county, MSA, state, and national levels.
Location Quotients Express Local Concentration
A location quotient (LQ) is a ratio that expresses an industry’s share of local jobs as
compared to the national total. For example, a LQ of 1.0 indicates that the local
industry has a normal concentration, that is, a concentration that matches the U.S.
total. A LQ of 2.0 indicates that the industry has twice the share of local jobs
compared to the national economy. A LQ of 0.5 shows that the local industry has
only half the share of jobs as it does at the national level.

Use the QCEW Data Viewer to compare location quotients for any industry or
location.

Local reflection of national trends
What is the most local (county) incidence of the recovery? Is it evenly spread, is
it concentrated in specific metropolitan areas, in the financial areas, or in the
high tech areas? QCEW can provide data to support this line of reporting.
QCEW publishes industry employment and wage totals for the nation and every
county, MSA, and state. It is not a survey but a quarterly census.
Comparative trend analysis is the most challenging task for QCEW users. The
QCEW Data Viewer provides measures of change for 2012 forward in the MultiYear Data section.
Analysis prior to this period is supported by comprehensive files on the BLS site
going back to 1975. The CSV version of these files include precalculated over-theyear change. Users combine these files to create a series. QCEW provides sample
code for converting these files into SAS and Access formats. QCEW also provides
files in a format designed for users who wish to load QCEW data into their own
SQL database.

Employment and wages in hurricane flood zones
The Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) program has created a
set of maps and data for hurricane flood zones on the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts.
Where permitted by State regulations, maps include dots indicating the location of
business and government establishments. This product is the combination of
geocoded BLS establishment data and flood zones created by the U. S. Corps of
Engineers and State emergency management authorities. For more information, see
the evacuation zone FAQ page.
Maps and Data:
http://www.bls.gov/cew/hurricane_zones/maps.htm
Evacuation Zone FAQ Page:
http://www.bls.gov/cew/hurricane_zones/hcat_faqs.htm
The summarized data are presented for each zone. If a Category I storm is
experienced, the subject establishments are represented by the Category I sums. The
Category II sums represent the establishments which are not in zone I but are in
zone II. To get a total for establishments subject to a Category II storm, users
should add the Category I and II values.

QCEW Data Viewer: county, MSA, state, and national data by industry
The QCEW Data Viewer provides point and click access to 100% of QCEW data
for 2012 forward. Data are presented in sortable tables. For example, see here for a
detailed industry table for Cobb County, GA. By default, these tables do not
display suppressed series. Users can override this default by checking a box.
BLS is working on adding data graphics and other features to this application.
Based on an open data access resource
The underlying data files used by the QCEW Data Viewer products are provided in
CSV form as part of the QCEW open data access resource. BLS has released
documentation of the underlying CSV data file naming convention, record layout,
and directory structure. The CSV files are available on the BLS web. Applications
can directly address these open data files through URLs.
Here is the link to the CSV data underlying the Cobb County example above:

QCEW Open Data Access: Create your own data app or database
QCEW data for 2012 forward are available in an open data access resource. This
resource is open to third party programmers, developers, and organizations. BLS
provides links here to QCEW open data access documentation as well as to sample
code in several languages.

Industry, Area, and Establishment Size Slices
QCEW open data files are sliced by industry, by area, and by establishment sizeclass. An industry slice contains all the records associated with the industry for a
single time period. An area slice contains all the records associated with the area
for a single time period. A size slice contains all records published within a specific
establishment size class for the first quarter of a specified year. Slices are named
and ordered into directories using a RESTful approach. All slices contain precalculated location quotients. For more information on location quotients, please
see the location quotients page.
Code Examples/Direct Access
QCEW data slices can be directly accessed from various programming languages.
BLS has provided simple examples in several languages. This removes the need to
download files.
QCEW Data Viewer
QCEW Data Viewer is the newest tool currently available at BLS for QCEW data
users. It takes the open data access files as its input.
