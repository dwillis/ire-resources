Arizona is one of the fastest growing states in the entire country.
o Our prison population is growing as well: Today we have 36,795 convicted felons serving time
at our ten facilities around the state.
o ADC is growing at a rate of nearly 170 new inmates a month.
We are working to reduce the R’s:
o Recidivism: Former inmates who return to the system on new charges within three years of
release.
o Relapse
 Inmates completing drug treatment - 1,500; drug education - 9,042.
 Positive urinalysis by inmates down 11%.
o Revocation: Former inmates who violate the terms of their parole or community supervision.
 Technical revocations reduced 51% from 3,257 to 2,290.
 Parolees successfully completing community supervision increased 50% from FY 2003
to FY 2006.
It is imperative that we reduce these areas. Consider:
o It costs, on average, $58.12 a day to keep an inmate in one of our facilities.
o 96% of all inmates will return to the “real world”.
 We do not have the option of “locking them up and throwing away the key.”
We are truly in the people business:
o We want to make sure these felons are capable of:
 Earning an education
• Inmates must have a high school level education.
o Our inmates now make up 1/3 of all GEDs in Arizona!
o We just awarded our 10,000th GED.
• Inmates have the opportunity to pay for and earn credits through our community
colleges and earn a two-year degree while behind bars.
 Holding down a job
• This is why we have created numerous Work Based Education Programs.
o When I cam to ADC, I sat with leaders from various industry secotrs and
asked they tell ADC what skills they look for in potential job candidates.
o We created job skill programs based on this advice.
 We service nig-rigs behind prison walls for Swift Trucking.
o We have inmate fire crews at nine of our ten complexes.
 These crews have saved our state taxpayers over a million dollars
this fiscal year by working more than 150,000 hours.
 Not only do these crews fight fires, they also clear brush and are
going back in and re-foresting fire ravaged areas.
• Another set of inmates learn horticulture skills by growing
the trees the fire crews use for the re-forestation projects!
 Participating in Restorative Justice

•

•

We provide opportunities for inmates to give back to crime victims through
various organizations, such as Mother’s Against Drunk Driving and Parents of
Murdered Children.
o Inmates have given nearly $300,000 of their own money and nearly
80,000 hours of labor to these organizations just in this fiscal year.
• Inmates have also improved the court-ordered restitution payments by 12%!
 Working to better their communities they have taken from:
• Each of our ten state prisons participate in a variety of projects:
o Over East: Safford inmates are rebuilding an entire city park, complete
with planters, trees and hand-made park benches.
o Over West: Yuma inmates just built an entire playground for kids in the
community to romp around.
We have created the term “Parallel Universe”.
o This term embodies the idea that ADC works to create a world behind the wall that is as similar
as possible to the world outside, given we are working with convicted criminals.
o These folks will be your neighbors, co-workers and may sit next to you the next time you step
into the theatre to catch a new movie.
o We are not just helping criminals correct their lives, but correcting the public’s perception of
corrections.
