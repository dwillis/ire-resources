Buying your ﬁrst bitcoin

Get a wallet
Your blockchain interface

Find an exchange

Or ﬁnd a stranger

And spend!

Or invest

Exchange for other currencies

And proﬁt!

Under the hood

Requires trust
Does Peter have at least $5 to pay
Paul when Peter says he does

Ofﬂoading Trust
●

Goal: Create an unchangeable ledger
○

●
●
●
●

●

Transactions cannot be blocked or reversed by an intermediary

Everyone’s bank balance is public
Everyone’s balance can be checked on a public ledger is eﬀectively giant
google spreadsheet that you can only append data
When I want to spend money I create a message detailing how much and
who the will receive payment… also known as a check
A group of “miners” gather all the checks into a pile (a “block”) and they
are racing other miners to add their pile of checks to the front of the
“chain”
Miners are “rewarded” for their eﬀort of making sure all prior checks
match what is on the public ledger

Hashing
Data goes in, value comes out…
Cannot be reversed

Hash functions begin to solve the issue of trust

Start with a hash

Format my hash so it ﬁts the structure of a “block”
My peers will only accept hashes with an agreed upon format

Miners work to create a hash matching an agreed format, “0000”
Adjust the “Nonce” until we get a HASH starting with four 0’s

What does a miner do?
Miners take all “unconﬁrmed” transactions and compiles them into a “block”
Links to the prior block on the chain
Performs the “proof of work” calculation or is chosen by the “proof of stake”
lottery to sign the block.
Proof-of-work: make sure a “hash” starts with the agreed-upon number of 0s
by manipulating the “nonce” and work for a reward of new coins
Proof-of-stake: Select older/wealthier investors and miners vote on the next
block to use and are paid with transaction fees

Connect blocks by linking to the hash of the prior block

Updating a block changes the hash of this block
Every block from this to the end of the chain must be “mined” again

Wait...
How can I tell if a chain was
changed?

Replicate!
Does peer B match peer A?

Comparing the hashes of blocks on different peers

Who’s right?
Majority rules

Distributed doesn’t mean decentralized
Transactions and ledgers are kept up to date and consistent through a
process known as “mining”
●
●

Few companies sell mining hardware
There are few “miners” of consequence that process transactions

Few exchanges exist where individuals can trade ﬁat for cryptocurrencies
Developers can change how the code works

Code is law
Everyone can’t agree?
Fork it!

Combine all the concepts to create internet money like Bitcoin

Wait, who is Ripley?
To spend coins, addresses
have to be unique. Receivers
have to be able to verify they
are authorized to send funds

Public Key Cryptography

Why no one else spends your bitcoin
●
●
●
●
●
●
●
●

You generate a public/private key pair
Private key is kept PRIVATE
Public key can be shared with ANYONE
Encrypt a message to “spend” bitcoins
You SIGN that message with your PRIVATE key
Send that SIGNATURE as part of your transaction
Anyone can use your PUBLIC KEY to verify the transaction was SIGNED by
YOU
If no one else has your private key, then only you could have signed it

Sign the check

Sending “money”
I need to know who will receive it (public key B)
I need to generate a message detailing the amount (hash)
I need to “sign” the message (private key A)
I need to publish my “check”
I need to wait for “miners” conﬁrm I can spend the money I say I have and to
add my check to the next pile of checks that will be published to the
blockchain

Does Peter have $5 to pay Paul?
Bitcoin currently does not maintain a current balance
●
●

Potentially, every transaction needs to be checked to determine the
balance of a wallet
Go backwards block-by-block until we can ﬁnd Peter was given $5 at some
point and hasn’t spent it all already

Coinbase
First transaction must create “money” and send it somewhere

Analyzing transactions

Challenges
●
●
●
●
●
●
●

Accessing records
Finding speciﬁc transactions
Storing records
Who owns a wallet?
Mixers
Cross-chain transactions
Exchanges

Lookup Tools

https://www.blockchain.com/explorer
https://etherscan.io/

Other queries?

IMPOSSIBLE!

Unless
You can access raw data

Wallet histories
Traverse the blockchain
to ﬁnd other
connections

1mb / 10 min

How can I trace transactions?
●
●
●
●
●
●

Engage a forensics company - Elliptic, Chainalysis, etc
Run a node, download everything
Use a BlockSci https://github.com/citp/BlockSci
Use an API from a block explorer to download slices
https://github.com/shaneshiﬄett/blockchain-scraper
https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/ethereum-bigquer
y-public-dataset-smart-contract-analytics

Wait, who is Ripley?
Or “gfadel47”... or Coinbase

Identifying Wallet Owners

Use a “phone book”

Find an ad!

Transact!

Then cluster!
Use heuristics to establish
rules to ﬁnd connected
addresses that “likely”
controlled by the same service

When the trail goes cold

Mixers and tumblers
○

●

Cross-chain services
○
○

●

Send crypto to a service that mixes it with other users funds and wallets
Original sender receives funds in a new wallet from multiple deposit address
Exchange bitcoin for ether, have to trace a new chain
Can exchange for privacy-focused coins like monero that don’t detail amounts or
destinations

Exchanges
○
○

Addresses are controlled by the exchange
Funds from multiple users are sent to shared accounts, records of who owns what is
private
