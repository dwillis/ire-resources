Investigating the nonprofit business world
Most nonprofit businesses and charities are required to release their annual tax
returns, or Form 990’s. These give an overview of revenues, expenses and
holdings; identify key employees and board members and their salaries; and
provide a wealth of other data to help you investigate the nonprofit.
Most nonprofits are registered under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3).
Must be released:
- IRS Form 1023 and attachments - application for IRS tax-exempt status
- Letter of determination from the IRS
- IRS Form 990 – annual tax return via www.guidestar.org – donors deleted
- or IRS Form 990-EZ - Revenues $100,000-$250,000
Exempted: nonprofits with <$25,000 annual revenue
Look for revenues, holdings, salaries, loans (Lines 50-51)
Track the essential data over time on an Excel spreadsheet
Internal Revenue Code Section 6104 says a nonprofit organization must make the
three most recent years of 990 forms available upon request at its headquarters
during normal business hours. Mail requests must be answered within 30 days.
Copying charges cannot exceed the IRS rate of $1 for the first page and 15 cents
a page after that.
