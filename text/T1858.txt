Guidelines for Writing a Book Proposal
I. Overview, which should answer the following questions:
1. What is the book about?
2. Why should your book be written? (give background on subject of book and its
importance, and why your treatment will be unique and is needed).
3. How do you plan to write and research your book?
4. In what ways (briefly, as you will also attach an author's bio) are you qualified to
write the book?
5. How does the proposed work (briefly, as you will attach a more detailed market
analysis) differ from other books (if any) on the topic?
6. How many pages do you anticipate will make up the final manuscript?
7. What else will be included, i.e., photos, drawings, appendices, bibliography?
8. When will the ms. be ready for submission?
II. Author qualifications
1. Attach a resume or bio that highlights your experience, education, and published
writings relevant to this project.
III. Market
1.Who is the book's audience?
2. How large is that audience and in what ways might the audience be reached?
3. Are there any special marketing opportunities for the book of which you are aware?
4. Can you get statements of support from well-known people in your field?
5. Do you have media contacts that could be helpful in the promotion of the book?
IV. Competition. Survey of every book currently available on the subject (if any) and
why your book differs from each (Amazon.com is a good source for this).
V. An outline or detailed table of contents with brief chapter summaries to indicate the
breadth and depth of the work.
VI. A sample chapter or chapter excerpt indicating style in which book will be written.
