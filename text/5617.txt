Getting past the press releases on the health beat

Facility inspection reports: Medicare, via private accreditation bodies and state health departments,
inspects and responds to complaints at thousands of health facilities including hospitals, nursing homes,
dialysis facilities, home health agencies, hospices and surgery centers:
Reports for hospitals are here: http://www.hospitalinspections.org/
Others are readily available through “direct release” from state health departments and Medicare
regional FOIA offices. That means you should get them quickly/easily
Facilities on the verge of being terminated by Medicare: https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/ProviderEnrollment-and-Certification/SurveyCertificationGenInfo/Termination-Notices.html -- get the inspection
reports, they are probably pretty juicy, and there’s a news peg
Facility license application: Can contain valuable information such as who owns the facility, etc.
To dig deep into an event at a health facility: Seek call for service or 911 log/audio from local
Emergency Medical Services for a certain time frame or date // We used those records to discover that
from the moment a surgery center called 911, it took 24 minutes to get 12-year-old Reuben Van
Veldhuizen to a hospital. //
Seek the autopsy report from the county coroner or ME. Ask for the log for the date of death if you
don’t have the name
Read Yelp reviews (search for facility name, MD/owner name, by the address) and contact reviewers if
you’re signed in (left rail there’s a ‘send message’ link)
If there’s litigation, do your best to get deposition transcripts and expert reports
Search gofundme pages and social media for topics of interest. This is a shot of a page from the IRE
Journal with great tips on searching Twitter, LinkedIn, etc:

Licensed health care providers: Doctors, nurses, dentists, physicians assistants and LVNs/LPNs all have
professional licenses. If they are accused of wrongdoing, there will likely be some documents on the
licensing board’s website. There may be more of a paper trial in administrative courts, including briefing
documents before a hearing, expert reports and witness lists. Those can be a treasure trove.
This is the relevant agency in CA: http://www.dgs.ca.gov/oah/Home.aspx

I start by requesting the docket, then seek specific items. You can get in touch with the court reporter
and seek audio of hearings or the transcript (which might cost a lot) or view it in the administrative court
office.
Filing an open records request for all documents related to a practitioner’s discipline proceeding to the
investigating agency can also be very fruitful
Finding people:
I’d search for Margot Williams’ tip sheets in the IRE archive. She’s a pro and has a great compendium of
people-finding resources.
A personal favorite is the Ancestry.com search for the departed – you can enter dates of birth/death and
get a name. https://search.ancestry.com/search/category.aspx?cat=34
Tell me what you really think: Disclosures to bond buyers via EMMA for nonprofit hospitals
Search for ‘health’, check off your state, narrow to recent years and sort by biggest $$ to see what the
major players think about a long list of health topics, how they make money, if they’re under
investigation, if they’re being sued: https://emma.msrb.org/Search/Search.aspx
How do the big chains plan to make money: Read quarterly earning calls for firms that have a local
footprint, like DaVita, UHS or Tenet Health: https://seekingalpha.com/earnings/earnings-call-transcripts
What laws are afloat re: health providers in your state and others? https://legiscan.com/
Call the health committee in the legislature to see if your local/major health systems or hospital
association, etc., sent a letter on interesting legislation
