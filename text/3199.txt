Math and Sports Talk
1. How is math used by sports teams?
2. To evaluate players, lineups, and in game strategy.

Baseball
1. How do we evaluate hitters? Based on S, D, T, HR, and BB’s, how good is a
hitter?
2. Assign all Runs scored by team to players .
3. Run a Regression to predict team runs based on team stats.
4. Bill James simplified this with his runs created formula.

In the most basic runs created formula:

where H is hits, BB is base on balls, TB is total bases and AB is at-bats.
This can also be expressed as:
OBP × SLG × AB
or,
OBP × TB
5. Really want to know how many runs a player adds to team above an average or
replacement player.
6. OPS simplifies things pretty well. OPS = OBP +SLG.
7. How to predict future performance: PECOTA by Nate Silver of 538.com
8. Hard to predict future performance of pitchers. Use HR’s, K’s and BB, not ERA!
9. How to evaluate fielders? Not Fielding percentage. Derek Jeter is worst fielding
SS in baseball! Ozzie Smith was best. Use Range factor or evaluate video to see
how many hits a fielder yields or prevents compared to average fielder. 1 hit =
,runs, 10 runs = 1 win.
10. How to compare pitchers and hitters? Look at how they change chance of winning
game. Down 2 runs hit 3 run HR with two out in 9th , you have changed chance of
winning from 9% to 100%. Give points to hitter and take points away from
pitcher. Bases loaded 2 outs bottom of 8th down 1 run. Chance of winning goes
from 25% to 0%.
11. Scales things so 2000 points = 1 win, so +10,000 means you created 5 more wins
than an average player in the same set of plate appearances.
12. Manny Ramirez Rocks!

13. Can create salary based on how many more wins than a replacement player you
create.
14. Strategy: Do not bunt! Man on first none out team will score on average .90 runs.
If bunt works we score .69 runs!

Basketball
• How to rate players. Use box scores?
• NBA efficiency =(Points+Reb+Assists+Steals+Blocks)
–(FGMissed+FTMissed+TO’s).
• Efficiency is flawed. Shoot 35% and more shots you take better you are.
• Pure +/- based on points per 48 minutes by which you outscore opponents.
LeBron +15, Yao +7, Big Z +18; Mike Conley -5.
• Need Adjusted +/-. We adjust for who you play with and against.
• Adjusted +/- for LeBron + 26 , Big Z +1, Yao +10, Conley 0.
• Also evaluate lineups. These two lineups are great

Down by 2 at end of game should we go for 3?
•
Should we foul other team if we are up by 3?

Football
1. How to evaluate plays. Is a runner who averages 4 yards a carry better than
a runner who averages 3.5 yards per carry?
2. Put a point value on a play: 3rd and 2 at midfield gain two yards; what is it
worth? V(3,2,50) = 1.5 V(1,10,52)== 2.02 value is .52 points
3rd and 8 at midfield gain 5 yards what is it worth?

V(3,8,50) = 1.03 V(4,3,55) = .68 worth -.35 points.
NFL overtime is unfair! How to fix it? Cake cutting problem. Winner of
coin toss picks yard line. Other team decides whether or not to take ball.
College football OT ; much fairer
Rating teams: What’s wrong with the BCS? Use least squares fit to scores
or logistic model when dealing with wins and losses.
Teams should pass much more than they do and go for it on 4th down more
often!
4th and 2 on other team’s 30. Go for it and gain 2 yards 3.61 points gain 1
yard
-.41 points. Go for FG make it 80% chance 2.66 points;
20% chance -.98 points.
Go for it if chance of making 1st down at least 60%.
