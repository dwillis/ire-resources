The following resources and obscure public records are among the best places to look for
information about how dark money groups are spending money in elections and who funds them.
Issue One’s “​Dark Money Illuminated​” project, with ​profiles​ of the largest dark money groups and a
searchable, sortable, online database​ featuring more than 400 unique dark money donors. ​Methodology​.
OpenSecrets.org allows you to search data on ​dark money spenders​ and ​over 4.9 million ad records​.
Business records - for LLCs, nonprofits and corporations
● Charitable solicitation records - NC, FL, NY, CA, WV (among others) require lots of information.
● State-level business documents - annual reports often list directors.

shows amounts each donor gave (while redacting the donors’ names).
