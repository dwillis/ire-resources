Behind
The Bloodshed
by USA Today

@jodiupton

In 2012, USA TODAY set out to find
how common mass killings were in
America. What we found is they are
far more common than people thought,
many do not involve a gun and most
involve some kind of ‘innocent
bystander.’ Perhaps more
importantly: the FBI’s data is wrong
about the nation’s most brutal
crimes nearly half of the time.

The Counted
by The Guardian

@kenandavis

The Counted works to count the
number of people killed by
police and other law
enforcement agencies in the
United States throughout 2015
and 2016, to monitor their
demographics and to tell the
stories of how they died.

Police Shootings
by The Washington Post

@dataeditor

In 2015, The Washington Post
chronicled every on-duty
police shooting by an oﬀicer
in the U.S. The eﬀort
continues in 2016.

The Next To Die
by The Marshall Project
Looking back, we know quite a bit
about who has been executed in
America. Looking ahead, however,
we know very little about who is
to be executed and how their
cases move through the system.
This project shines a light on
these cases and the death penalty
in action nationwide.
