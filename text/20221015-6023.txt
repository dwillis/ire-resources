IRE Tip Sheet
The Intersection of Schools and Two Major Themes Facing our Nation
•

•

•

•

Will this pandemic lead to higher high school dropout rates?
•

Superintendents are watching their enrollment right now.

•

Schools are going door-to-door trying to find kids who didn’t enroll.

How much will this pandemic widen the gap between wealthy and poor students?
•

San Antonio’s schools on the north side are trying to come back earlier than
schools on the south side that have already pushed into October. How
significant is the learning loss? Especially for early childhood, English language
learners and special education.

Stories about our past are relevant now.

•

The origin of school districts and racial segregation have left vestiges of
inequality to this day.

•

You might find it relevant to talk about how those areas are the most struggling
during the pandemic.

Disproportionate discipline.
•

School leaders are taking another look at their discipline numbers and ​finding
racial disparities.​ Which schools are making changes?

Holding School Boards Accountable on the Daily Grind

Questions I’ve asked:
o How are school districts spending their money?
o What legal battles are they engaging in?

●

How much money are they spending on legal fees?
How many law firms are they hiring?
Who is calling the shots? The superintendent or the lawyers or the trustees? Who
should be making the decisions?
o Who is the district doing business with? Do the trustees or superintendent have any
connections with them? We always check their property.
Sourcing
o Branch out from the trustees and superintendent.
o CFOs can usually explain the numbers better than anyone.
o Teachers. Cover the awards ceremonies for dailies in order to introduce yourself to
teachers (and collect phone numbers!).
o Community members. They’ve got their ear to the ground and are happy to share. This
is especially important during COVID-19.
o State legislators. They are privy to state investigations before the public.
o Data – you have to get comfortable using data. EWA workshops and mentors have saved
me. Always ask to speak with the person who makes the data.
