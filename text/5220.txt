LET’S GET DIGITAL
Many newsrooms are still figuring out their digital strategy but in the meantime,
journalism still needs to happen. How can journalists, who don't have the team or
resources to build custom features, think and execute more digitally?

THINK
Because digital shouldn’t be an afterthought ...

So how do you produce multimedia for an
investigation?
•Start by have a conversation with your team. Whether that’s
your editor, reporter, photographer, or just yourself. Make sure
you have an understanding of what the story is that you are
trying to tell, as well as what you are trying to show.
•What sort of material will you produce? Text, photos,
illustrations, charts and data visualizations, audio, video, or a
combination of the above.
•More isn’t always better. Just use the elements you need to tell
the story. Sometimes it’s one. Sometimes it’s multiple elements.

•Understand your time frame and budget. What can you
produce with the money you have? You can still do great work
on a budget by thinking creatively.
•Understand the scope of your project. Will you gather the
material yourself? Will someone else on your team create it? Will
you acquire archival material? Will you hire a freelancer?
•Quality over quantity. Only produce what you know you can do
with excellence. Be hard on yourself! Make it awesome.

VISUALS

So you are working on an investigation?
What is best way to use multimedia to tell your story digitally?

"There’s nothing like a good photographer to bring alive an
investigative story. One of the worst crimes that
investigative journalists commit is spending months on a
great story, and then only minutes on the presentation.
Working with photojournalists who know their craft (along
with designers and graphic artists) can be one of the real
pleasures of putting a big project together."
— From Investigative Photography: Supporting a Story with Images, by CJ
Clarke, Damien Spleeters, and Juliet Ferguson July 15, 2013

Know the difference between a story with
visuals on it — and a visual story.

In a story with visuals on it, the visuals are
basically decorative.
Be careful not to fall into the trap of grabbing
a cheesy stock photo. Avoid this! It doesn’t
lend anything to your story other than take up
space.
In a visual story, you are writing with visuals
— showing rather than telling.

Remember, photography is
about RELATIONSHIPS.
It’s about how we relate to
the world and how we
understand it. It’s about
showing and sharing our
common humanity.

Photo by John Stanmeyer

To add great visuals to your
stories, consider:
Invest in decent photo gear
(especially lenses!) and have team
members trained on how to use it.
Better yet, hire a visual professional
onto your staff.
and/or
Hire talented freelancers (for photo,
illustrations, video, etc.), pay them
fairly, and develop great relationships
with them.
and/or
Develop relationships with other area
media to share visuals if you are not
in a position to make them, or pay for
them yourself.

In this story, the Wisconsin Center for
Investigative Journalism used photos and
audio reporting to explore the issue of
undocumented workers on Wisconsin’s
dairy farms. The photos and natural
sound help bring the viewer/listener
directly into the scene.
Photos and audio were created by staff

Here, Reveal used illustrations to help readers visualize something that couldn’t easily be photographed —
child abuse in religious day care centers as part of their series “The God Loophole”.

VISUALS
In this piece, National
Geographic photographer
Tyrone Turner used
creative stitched
photography and audio
interviews to tell the story
of relationships and
culture in New Orleans.
The photographer and
editors established a flat
rate for this project, no
matter how long it took.

VISUALS
Wisconsin Center for
Investigative Journalism
produced this illustrated
audio slideshow with
voice actors to convey
what it's like in long-term
solitary confinement.
The voice actors
volunteered their time,
and the illustrator, a
recent college grad, gave
a very reasonable rate.
(Read full story here)

VISUALS
NPR produced this
public service piece of
journalism using
photos and a simple
quiz to help viewers
figure out if they have
lead pipes in their
homes.
They also published it
in Spanish.

VISUALS
In this package, The
Washington Post used
graphics, video and
interactive web design to
bring viewers different
perspectives from
Standing Rock. They
included voices from
various sides of the story
to create balance.

VISUALS
Here, NPR’s Adam
Cole used
illustrations,
graphics, photos,
video, field reporting
and humor to explain
the story behind
snowy owl migration.
(Yes, investigative
journalism can be
fun!)

VISUALS
NPR produced an
investigative short
film to show how the
military was treating
soldiers with
traumatic brain injury.
A freelancer was hired to
shoot images, while the
video was shot and edited
by staff.

VISUALS
National Geographic
produced an
investigative
documentary to help
expose the illegal
ivory trade in their
series "Warlords of
Ivory."
(ok, they have a huge
budget, who are we
kidding…)

VISUALS
So why use multimedia in investigative journalism to tell your
story digitally?
Because it's intimate, it's powerful and it can hit you in the heart.
It can tell a story powerfully, deeply and succinctly, in
conjunction with text.
Multimedia elements can take the reader even deeper into the
story. They let them see, hear and feel the story in a meaningful
way that they will remember, perhaps long after they have put
the story away.

And...because the work can have real impact, like these stories did.
