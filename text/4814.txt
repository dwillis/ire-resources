Don’t let school systems hide behind FERPA
 The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act is a Federal law that protects the
privacy of students
 FERPA relates to education records but what’s a RECORD?
 Station attorneys can challenge the application of FERPA in court but a better
approach may be to work around the school system
 For visuals look for sources that can provide images of students who are OVER
age 18
 Those images and identities are fair game to report

Search for stories outside the classroom

School athletics are big business and can be big news
Younger players are bigger, faster and stronger than ever before
That can create its own set of safety concerns and stories
Newsrooms are just scratching the surface when it comes to player safety
Often no one outside of the sports department is paying attention

How are national trends impacting your local school system?

Problems in one school district are rarely unique
Students are known for copycat misbehavior
Watch national news and education reporters in other markets for ideas
Submit open records requests in your area to see if there are similar issues
ORR’s can contain keywords that mimic the issues reported in other cities

Don’t forget to involve the desk in your reporting
 Assignment editors hear scanner traffic that can be gold
 Video of school bus fights, juvenile arrests can all originate from scanner traffic
 This is especially helpful in video poor school stories based on records requests or
a single viral video clip
