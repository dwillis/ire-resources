Dear Mr. Nichols,
Pursuant to the state open records law, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. Secs. 39-121 to
39-126, I write to request access to and a copy of all expense reports for the city for
the past five years. If your agency does not maintain these public records, please let
me know who does and include the proper custodian’s name and address.
I agree to pay any reasonable copying and postage fees of not more than
$25. If the cost would be greater than this amount, please notify me. Please provide a
receipt indicating the charges for each document.
As provided in the open records law, I will expect your response within ten
(10) business days.
If you choose to deny this request, please provide a written explanation for the
denial including a reference to the specific statutory exemption(s) upon which you rely.
Also, please provide all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material.
Please be advised that I am prepared to pursue whatever legal remedy
necessary to obtain access to the requested records. I would note that willful violation
of the open records law can result in the award of court costs and reasonable attorney
fees.
Thank you for your assistance.
Sincerely,
David Cuillier

A note about fees in Texas
111.67. Estimates and Waivers of Public Information Charges
(a) A governmental body is required to provide a requestor with an
itemized statement of estimated charges if charges for copies of public
information will exceed $40, or if a charge in accordance with §111.65 of
this title (relating to Access to Information Where Copies Are Not
Requested) will exceed $40 for making public information available for
inspection. A governmental body that fails to provide

the required statement may not collect more than
$40. The itemized statement must be provided free of charge and must
contain the following information:

$5
Waived
for poor

Free

Eliminating fees
1. Ask for a waiver because of public good
2. Instead of getting copies, inspect
3. Photograph the docs, scan, or copier
4. Narrow your order
5. Get the records in a digital format
6. Make the agency justify cost with list
7. Request copy contract (1.2 cents)
8. Survey local agencies and shame

▪ HIPAA
▪ Privacy
▪ Privatization

Negotiating: Some
examples

Excuses

complicated, Missy
• We don’t have the authority to do that
• That will cost $25,000

• We use proprietary software
• It’s not on computer
• That information is protected

Activity: Negotiating
• Pair up in groups of 3
• 3 rounds, each person plays the requester,
the custodian, and observer
• Each round poses a different scenario
• Requester uses tactics discussed
• Observer takes notes and feedback
• Take 10 minutes (3 minutes for each)
• Then we will share (5 minutes)
