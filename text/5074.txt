Breaking NEWS during breaking NEWS
What we don’t know after the obvious nuts and bolts
 What data might be available?
 How easily is it accessed?
 Is it in a form I can understand and analyze?
 How fast can I understand and analyze it?
 What value could it provide to our coverage?
 Where do I go?
 Find relationships; put event into context.
 Be prepared—know what you should have before news breaks

3 levels
1. What can you find online—immediately
2. What can you get from public documents—where do you need to go get it
3. Is there a bigger story we need to look into long term (ask if there is more to the story)
Keep it organized!

City and School Employee Databases
 Get list from each jurisdictions in your area
 Ask for first/middle/last names, salaries, date of hire
 Ask for department, position, age, home address, and gender
 Get data in spreadsheet form
 This can help you confirm details about an employee when news
breaks (or in general backgrounding) when many times PIOs refuse to
confirm a person's employment
 Have to get this ahead of time, but a great tool to have at
your disposal for breaking news and long term projects.
Geofeedia.com
 Great new website that helps you locate pictures, video, and
other types of media around a particular location
 You pick the location, then posts will appear and you can
individually view them. Makes it easy to find pics & video of a scene,
plus contact witnesses
 This site is new, but free to journalists. They should be
able to verify your credentials within a day, but better to sign up
before you need it
ALSO BANJO for smarthphone
Images.Google.com
 Not only can you use Google to look for images once you've
started a regular Google search, you can also do a reverse image search
 When on the Google image website, just click on the camera
icon & upload your own pic. Then Google will scan the web for other
sites that the image appears on
 This can help you confirm a person's identity, see if their
Facebook pic appears on other websites, or find out if a picture is fake
or ripped off of another website
OpenStatusSearch.com
 Who needs to be Facebook friends when you have this website?
When breaking news happens, use OpenStatusSearch.com to see what people
are saying about an incident, person, or subject matter



Can be used to find victims, witnesses, neighbors, etc. Just
click the person's name and send them a Facebook message or use your
favorite phone number finder to locate their info
People Finders
 Spokeo
 ZabaSearch
 SkipEase
 Intelius
 http://www.familytreenow.com/
Kick-ass social media searches:
 Facebook graph search: http://www.graph.tips/
 Facebook advanced search: https://searchisback.com/
 YouTube search by location: http://www.geosearchtool.com/
 Social search by username: http://knowem.com/
 (when searching twitter, cut through the clutter by using key words in your search like “I”
“we” “our”, cuts out the news tweets and retweets)

Private Companies
 If it's a private company, check review websites
 BBB (what's the rating like, have there been recent complaints, will
the BBB connect you with consumers?)
 Your state's Attorney General and Secretary of State
 Yelp, CitySearch, Yahoo
Web Archive (formerly Wayback Machine)
 Sometimes right after a breaking news event a company or person will
pull down its website. Use a search engine's "Cache" function to pull up
old versions of the page
 Check out http://archive.org/index.php for what used to be called the
Wayback Machine to also get access to archived webpages
 This is also helpful to check for longer term investigations if
you're trying to see what a company used to advertise, get old phone
numbers, etc.
