real talk:
alcohol and journalism
how I started drinking less, sleeping more and being less of
a general shitshow (and how you can too, if you want)

There are a
bunch of logical
reasons
journalists tend to
drink.

What if we actually saw this as
a problem instead of a quirky
feature of the journalism
community?

What if we were
cognizant of when, why
and how much we’re
drinking?

Why change?
For me, it was a weird combination of cadaver
lab and mindfulness therapy.

What’s a “drink?” According to the feds...
12 oz of 5% beer
5 oz of 12% wine
1.5 oz 40-proof liquor

One pint of that 10% imperial IPA?

2.7 standard drinks

We’re a bunch of geeks. So, be
a geek.

Some things I didn’t know.
You can ask your doctor to refer to you someone to talk about alcohol or evaluate
you. They will probably be stoked you asked.
You can get a therapist just to talk about drinking. You don’t have to go to group
(though it might help!)
If you have a therapist for other stuff already, it’s okay to bring up your drinking.
Insurance should cover it (thanks, Obama).
