The basics of the beat

Who to talk to (the usual suspects)
● Elected and appointed oﬃcials (city councils, state
and regional transportation agencies, etc.)
● Regulators (FTA, FRA, OSHA, and state-level bodies
that oversee operations, safety, construction, etc.)
● Lobbyists
● Advocacy groups
● Labor unions
● Workers (bus drivers, construction workers, etc.)

Don’t forget…
●
●
●
●
●
●
●
●

Deputies for elected oﬃcials
Metropolitan planning organizations
Industry trade groups (APTA)
Think tanks (Brookings and RAND are helpful)
Armchair enthusiasts
Online communities, especially Facebook groups
Commuters
Other transportation reporters!

So much data, so little time

A record is created every time:
●
●
●
●
●
●
●

You scan your ticket to enter the station
You walk onto the train
The train leaves the station
The train breaks down
The operator calls about the breakdown
Someone comes to ﬁx the train
The train is repaired…

And usually, there’s at least two versions of each data set.

Which data sets are worth
your time?

Transit ridership numbers

-7%
Change in U.S. transit ridership over a decade,
if New York is excluded.
How is your city doing?

Source: Congressional Research Service

Ridership numbers 101
● National Transit Database, run by the Federal Transit
Administration: https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd
○ Almost all transit systems required to report regularly
○ Current as of a few months ago
○ Less speciﬁc
○ Available immediately
● Your local transit agency
○ Speciﬁc to lines, stops, times of day, or however else
you want to slice it
○ May take longer to get

The unit of measurement in ridership is
“unlinked passenger trips.” One trip is
not equivalent to one person. One
person typically takes multiple trips (a
round-trip, or a transfer).

FTA’s “Monthly Module Adjusted Data Release”

Use the attached key (the tab “READ ME”)
to identify what the mode codes mean
(light rail, heavy rail, etc.)
Beware of directly operated vs.
contracted service
Don’t compare months within the same
year, because ridership ﬂuctuates
seasonally. Instead, compare the same
month in multiple years (e.g., change
from April 2017 to 2018).

Transit databases that lead to good stories
●
●
●
●
●
●

System breakdowns by type, by line, over time
Inspection and maintenance records
Ticket scans
Customer complaints
Surveys of current and former riders
Red-light violations for agency vehicles

Tip: When you request a database, be sure to request the data
dictionary and the records layout.

Travel speeds
Have toll lanes or carpool
lanes come to your
highways? Have carpool
lanes been converted to
toll lanes? How has it
changed travel speeds?
Get it from:
● Your state highway
or transportation
agency
● Toll road authority
● Tech companies
(Waze, Inrix)

Collisions
Who is involved in traﬃc
crashes? How severe are
they?
Has your city adopted
Vision Zero? Is it working?
Get data from:
● State highway agency
● Local police
● National Highway
Traﬃc Safety
Administration FARS
database

Rail crossings
Do train tracks run through
your city? How are cars and
trains separated?
Getting to know this data
will come in handy the next
time there’s a train crash.
Get the data from:
● The Federal Railway
Administration’s Oﬃce
of Safety Analysis
● Tip: On deadline, you’ll
want “Query by
Location” -------------->

Taxi trips
How has the arrival of Uber
and Lyft in your area
changed business for the
local taxi companies?
Get it from:
● The agency that
issues permits or
medallions for taxi
drivers or franchises
● Airports, which
sometimes keep their
own data on taxi trips

Documents to dig through

Documents that teach you the beat
