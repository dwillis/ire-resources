DIGGING [for]
DOCUMENTS

Public records:

Tips and tactics
Practical advice and strategies for
crafting public records requests,
tracking them and holding officials’
feet to the fire. Includes strategies
for dealing with excuses and
obstacles from public officials who
stand in your way of getting key
documents and data.

Three strategies
• Narrow request
– Exactly what you want
– Get blank copies of
forms regularly filled

• Ask for everything
– Make broad request, then negotiate.

• Make regular requests
– as part beat coverage, ask for calendars, emails,
audits, inspection reports

Where to begin
• What are you looking for?
– FOIA applies to documents, not information

• Does exist elsewhere?
– exhaust other avenues
– Check web sites
– Agency e-reading rooms

• Do your homework
– Know what you seek.
– Learn how/where/why kept
– Research the law on which
record is based

Tips for Finding
and Using Documents
•
•
•
•

Documents aren’t only paper: Think electronically.
Documents can be wrong. Double check math, dates, facts.
File FOIAs – don’t be discouraged by stonewalling
Request FOIA logs. Lists what others, attorneys, businesses and
special interests are requesting
• Get government retention schedules. Lists documents that an
agency *should* keep, and how government refers to them.
• Request the same records from multiple departments and
agencies.
• Triangulate records

Where to find documents

• Federal, state, local

FOIA for Melania’s Travel

FOIA ● May 2, 2017 -- FOIA Filed.
● May 10 -- Receipt acknowledged
Timeline ● May-August -- The 20-day limit for responding to
passes without response
● Sept. 6 -- Dow Jones attorney Joe Weissman contacts the AF FOIA
office by phone and email to request an update. No response.
● Sept. 14 -- Joe leaves a voicemail with the AF FOIA office and speaks
to FOIA Public Liaison, who said that AF's response to the Request
was “unacceptable" and promised an update by 9/19.
● Joe also calls information specialist handling FOIA who says she has
the responsive records and that it would be a “full release." In an email
to me she stated. “we should have a final response mailed to you by the
end of next week."
●

Sept. 22 -- Radio silence continues

● Oct. 3 -- Joe calls
● Oct. 4 -- Specialist calls back and says, "We anticipate that this FOIA
request be closed by Oct. 12."
● Oct. 12 -- Radio silence continues. Joe calls and emails. Specialist says
in a telephone call that the request
would be completed in a week. i.e. by October 19.
● Oct. 19 -- Radio silence.
● Oct. 20, Oct. 23 and Nov. 3 -- Joe makes numerous attempts to contact
specialist. No response. I suggest that Joe try the general counsel’s
office.
● Nov. 14 -- Joe calls AF Deputy General Counsel who said he would
attempt to determine the status of the request and have it processed.
● Dec. 4 -- Specialist emails and said the Request was “still under review
with the Department of Defense."

● Dec. 6 -- Joe emailed to specialist and asked for a timeline for processing the
request and to expedite the processing as much as possible. No response.
● Dec. 18 -- Joe calls Deputy GC by phone. He requested that Joe forward his
recent email communications -- which he did.
● Dec. 21 -- Joe contacts Deputy GC to request an update concerning his my
request for a status update.
● Dec. 22 -- Deputy GC emails to say that he would be personally engaging with
the Department of Defense concerning the Request but that such efforts would
be delayed due to the holidays.
● Dec. 27 -- A (new) lawyer, an Assistant Deputy GC, emails Joe: “The
documents identified as potentially responsive to your request were forwarded to
through Air Force channels for review and further coordination at the DOD
FOIA office" but that "Air Force FOIA folks have not received word from them
yet on release." He did not provide an estimated timeline.

Final Appeal
On Jan. 5, Joe took the last step before a lawsuit, and wrote: “Dow Jones can
be left with no other impression than that DAF [Department of the Air Force]
is not exercising due diligence in responding to the Request” and cited to the
case Bloomberg. L.P. v. FDA, 500 F. Supp. 2d 371, 376 (S.D.N.Y. 2007)
[noting that "repeated missed deadlines. unexplained timeline adjustments,
and limited communication" from the agency show a lack of due diligence].
He added, “For the foregoing reasons, we respectfully appeal the failure of
DAF to respond to the Request and urge the DAF to release the records
immediately.”

On Jan. 12, the Air Force sent the documents we requested.

Expediting Requests
• you are a journalist who disseminates

Pick for Health Secretary
Traded Medical Stocks While
in House

President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to run the Health and Human
Services Department traded more than $300,000 in shares of health-related
companies over the past four years while sponsoring and advocating
legislation that potentially could affect those companies’ stocks.
Rep. Tom Price, a Georgia Republican, bought and sold stock in about 40
health-care, pharmaceutical and biomedical companies since 2012, including
a dozen in the current congressional session, according to a Wall Street
Journal review of hundreds of pages of stock trades he filed with Congress.
In the same two-year period, he has sponsored nine and co-sponsored 35
health-related bills in the House.

Secrecy Prompts Project
The U.S. Congress eight years ago did
something it rarely had done before:
Lawmakers exempted from the
Freedom of Information Act a database
that traced guns used in crimes back to
firearms dealers.
Called the Tiahrt Amendment

The Blackout
• The resulting blackout curtailed what
had been a steady stream of media
investigations into gun stores and
firearms trafficking.
• The assignment from Investigations
Editor Jeff Leen: Break the secrecy.

How We Broke the Secrecy
• Created a database of more than 35,000 guns
traced to crimes from unpublicized state databases
and local police evidence logs from Maryland,
Virginia and the District of Columbia.
• Compiled a list of 511 police officers killed by
firearms. This was done by reviewing thousands
of police and court records and 30 crime gun
traces from court files on police killings.
• Obtained lists of the top 12 gun dealers in the past
two years who have sold the most weapons traced
from Mexican crime scenes

In Virginia
• Learned from a Post colleague about a
database called the “Virginia Criminal
Firearms Clearinghouse”
– Created by state law in 1993
– Requires all local police in Virginia to report all
guns they take into possession to VSP.
– Must fill out dozens of fields of information,
including – if done – results of the ATF trace.
