California Public Records Act

Gov. Code 6250-6270

Our transparency law

The bad news
• Hundreds of exemptions to disclosure
• No firm deadlines for disclosure
• No enforcement and appellate processes other
than Superior Court
• Police personnel and investigative records
exempt from disclosure
• Competing privacy rights often win out
• Complacency rampant in California bureaucracies

The good news

3 principles for dealing with this

•1. Literacy
•2. Persistence
•3. Relentlessness

Literacy – knowing the law
Employing the law properly.
Do not:
Use a PRA request ask questions. The PRA is
used solely to acquire documents. Ask for
documents.
Ask for lists. The government has no obligation
to create a document in response to a request.
Ask for records informally

Literacy 2
• Do:
• Cite the law. Show the person you know how
this works and cannot be easily dismissed.
• Let the government know what you expect.
The law requires a determination of what
records exist and what will be provided given
in 10 days. Hold them to that.
• Always use your right to inspect records
before asking for copies

Persistence
• When the 10 days are up insist on a
substantive response immediately.
• When exemptions are cited, demand specifics.
A laundry list of exemptions applied to a 60
page document does little good when you
need to make a challenge.
• Push back on lagging delivery of inspection.
Remember, it is our right to inspect records.
You want to see them.

Relentlessness
• When you aren’t getting records, be a pain in
the ass.
• Spread your aggression around. Copy elected
officials on emails.
• PRA your PRA
• Do not accept excuses. The law has no
subsection on being short staffed, busy, ect.
• Do not subordinate yourself – all responsibility
is on the government to satisfy your request

Tips
• Be broad in what you request. Avoid questions
like “what specifically are you looking for?”
because they are then likely to exclude it.
• Never use the word redaction. Censorship is
censorship is censorship.
• When requesting emails, be sure to cite the
recent supreme court decision.
• Don’t threaten to sue unless you know you will
sure. But don’t be afraid to remind them that
suing is always an option and will be followed by
a fee motion.
