Out of sight. Out of mind.
Schmooze – or lose.
 Hang out, meet & greet…and smile. Avoid the office.
 Secretaries, mid-level managers.
 Unions – AFSCME (white collar union)
 Glassdoor
 Newsletters, email blasts
 SEC filings 10K. (Google: Kiplinger 10K tip sheet. IRE.org.)

Knowledge is power. Build on it.
 Civil court , disputes, discrimination, divorces
 Who is closet to information (circle approach)
 Lockheed Michoud
 Emergency contact lists (public record)
 Rating agency contacts – Bond Buyer. Trade Journals.
 Bond tracker
 Auditors – every agency gets audited
 CAFR – certified annual financial report.
 Tap non-traditional sources –
 Puentes

Langniappe:
