Transcript edited by Adeleine Halsey, Rashika Jaipuriar and Doug Meigs
Rose Aguilar, host of San Francisco’s “Your Call” on KALW-FM, interviewed Corey Johnson
(formerly of the Tampa Bay Times) for “Media Roundtable: How Florida’s only lead factory
poisoned its workers and polluted the community.” The interview originally aired June 10,
2022. It was transcribed, edited and condensed for The IRE Journal with permission from the
journalists. The following transcript is their full interview. Lines 18-179 and 262-352 were first
published as, “The making of ‘Poisoned’,” on pages 30-35 of The IRE Journal’s first quarter
2023 edition.

Rose Aguilar: “Poisoned” is an 18-month three-part series by Tampa Bay Times investigative
reporters Corey Johnson, Rebecca Woolington and Eli Murray. “Poisoned” is about Gopher
Resource, a Tampa, Florida, based lead factory where workers extract lead from used car
batteries, melt it down and turn it into blocks of metal to then resell.
Part one reveals that hundreds of workers have been exposed to dangerous levels of
lead. The consequences have been profound. Part two reveals that equipment designed to
control poisons inside Gopher Resource kept breaking down, creating more danger for
workers. As violations mounted, the regulators were absent. Part three reveals that Gopher
Resource promised changes, but it kept polluting.
The three journalists spent 18 months examining thousands of pages of regulatory
reports and company documents, including data tracking the amount of lead in the air and in
workers’ blood. They interviewed more than 80 current and former workers, 20 of whom
shared their medical records. Company officials would not agree to an interview. Gopher’s
Chief Operating Officer Eric Robinson issued a statement to The Times and answered some
questions in writing.
Joining us to discuss “Poisoned” is Corey Johnson. Johnson is now a reporter with
ProPublica. He spent five years as an investigative reporter with the Tampa Bay Times.
Johnson is the sixth Black journalist to win the Pulitzer in the investigative reporting category
since it was created in 1964.

Aguilar: How did you find out about what was happening in the Gopher Resource factory?
Corey Johnson: It was a journey rooted in something very personal to me. When I came to
the Tampa Bay Times in January 2017, I had been watching the news reports from months
prior of what was happening in Flint, Michigan, with lead in the water. I saw those images of
brown water coming out of faucets, and it hit me deeper than maybe the average person
because on my mother’s side of the family, all my family was from Flint, Michigan.
I can remember going up to Flint as a child in the ’80s. Every summer we would go up
there to Grandma’s house, and I would drink that water and it would taste God awful. I
remember the very first time I saw someone with bottled water. My aunt had her own water
cooler in her house because the water tasted so bad. And at that time, people clowned my
aunt. Buying water is very regular now, but back in 1981-1984, people criticized and laughed
at you for buying water. They were like, “Water is free everywhere. What fool would buy some
water?” Yet in Flint, Michigan, even going back that far, a lot of people knew about the “janky”
water, to be blunt.
On a whim, I just started to read about what lead does. And as I discovered that lead
was horrible in the human body and particularly with children — that just a little bit of lead
could cause permanent brain damage, that lead could go to a child’s brain and injure the areas
of the brain that dealt with IQ and impulse control and behavior — I started to wonder if lead
was a bigger problem than just in Flint, Michigan.
Discovering a confidential source
Johnson: When I got hired at the Tampa Bay Times, I started to look around to see if the
paper had done any coverage of lead in any meaningful, focused way and found that it hadn’t.
So, I immediately started to reach out to the schools and ask the local school district what they
were doing about lead.
Those questions resulted in a series of stories that revealed that the school district had
a huge lead problem. They had known about it and essentially covered it up and didn’t tell the
teachers or the students, and did not take the necessary steps to remove the bad water
fountains and the bad sinks. They were knowingly exposing kids and teachers to high amounts
of lead without their knowledge. So, we wrote some stories about it, and that got an incredible
response from the community and forced the school officials to make serious changes to fix
that.
And as that reporting was happening, I got a call from a confidential source in the local
health department to meet. That source handed over a state report of about 165 or so pages.
Inside were two pages dog-eared for me to pay attention to, and those pages talked about lead
poisoning throughout the state of Florida. And it turned out that Hillsborough County, which
was the area that we reported on, led the entire state of Florida in the numbers of people who
were getting lead poisoning, particularly adults. More adults were getting lead poisoning in our
county than anywhere else in Florida.

That was a red flag because Hillsborough County is not the largest county in Florida.
There are bigger counties with more people and older buildings, all of the key things that
scientists and researchers look at when they try to factor in lead. And so it felt odd and
incredibly important to try to figure out why Hillsborough County had so many adults who were
getting lead poisoning.
The report also hinted that a battery recycler was playing a key role in this. The report
didn’t identify who the recycler was, and so that became a focus to try to figure out who was
doing this and why. And that’s how the reporting essentially got started.
Aguilar: Why did this official reach out to you and give you these documents?
Johnson: Because they were noticing the coverage and noticing various high schools and
elementary schools and middle schools that we were identifying. The official wanted me to
know that it wasn’t just the schools and that the problem was far bigger and more expansive
than just some water in a school somewhere. I’m incredibly appreciative that happened
because, at the time, we were just focused on the schools, and we had no idea that it was a
bigger, broader problem.
Local journalism protects communities
Aguilar: That just speaks to the power and the importance of local investigative journalism.
Johnson: Yes, it does. The Tampa Bay Times is very, very fortunate that even in this
environment of fake news and people having some legitimate gripes about coverage and some
more politicized gripes about coverage, there’s still very much a deep appreciation and respect
for the Tampa Bay Times as a news institution, for the most part. People still read and think
about the coverage, particularly if it’s more of a watchdog, investigative type. I’m grateful for
that because it just proves that journalism is not dead.
After we won the Pulitzer Prize, my team was invited to go to the soccer match of the
local professional soccer team. They brought us down on the field. We got this huge ovation
from the crowd. They told the crowd that we won the Pulitzer and about the stories we had
done. For the rest of that night, people were just coming up to us saying, “Thank you. Thank
you for your work. Thank you for what you’re doing. We really appreciate that.” People still very
much want, need and appreciate good journalism, despite what you might see online or in
social media.
Aguilar: That’s such a great point. So, let’s talk about Gopher Resource. As you reported over
the last decade, more than a third of the lead battery recycling factories in the United States
have gone out of business, including one in South Carolina that shut down in March 2021. At
the time of this interview, only 10 such factories remain. Why are these lead battery recycling
factories going out of business?

Johnson: Well, the lead industry and these battery recycling plants are a dirty business.
“Dirty,” not saying dirty-bad, but they use a lot of toxins and chemicals to take the lead to refine
it to make products. As a result, that stuff has to go somewhere.
There have been incredible horror stories in the past about these companies dumping
these toxins in various communities and various streams and water, waterways and just
creating a lot of pollution, and a lot of people being impacted.
Just in California, south in the Los Angeles area, there was a very infamous lead
smelter in Vernon, California, that resulted in a lot of federal prosecutions and lawsuits around
the poisonings of the local community that the smelter was doing.
As the regulations and the rules have begun to get better and tighter to protect
communities, a lot of these companies have just felt like it wasn’t economically viable to make
the improvements and still make their profits. So, as a result, a lot of them have gone out of
business. In Florida, we happen to have one that has not gone out of business, that promised
and pledged that it could operate safely and still be profitable. Our investigation essentially
proved that was far from the case.
Greenwashing and community pride
Aguilar: As a citizen, you would never know because when you go to the Gopher Resource
website, you read, “Our facility in Tampa Bay provides advanced battery recycling services
and hundreds of green jobs for citizens throughout the Tampa region.” Then, when you click
on the factory, it says, “Battery recycling: Our Tampa facility keeps nearly 12 million spent lead
batteries from landfills annually.” Now, if you’re a recycler and you care about the planet, you
would think, “Hey, there’s this two-word term, green energy, this sounds fantastic.” Then you
might just walk away without really thinking, “Wow, well, what does this mean for the workers?
And what does this mean for the surrounding community?”
Johnson: Yeah, and you know, the irony of it is that when we approached the regulators with
a lot of our findings, they too thought about the green jobs and the plant was much safer than it
was. We also found, as we dug into it, that this plant did not have to be this dirty. It did not
have to be this dangerous. There were just a set of things that happened that compromised a
lot of the fail-safes and a lot of the systems that are in place to make it a safer, healthier
environment. When that happened, improving those systems ended up costing more money
than the company really wanted to spend, so they ignored it. So, is there a possibility that a
smelter can operate safely? Yes, but that went terribly sideways in Tampa.
Aguilar: You report that this company was founded 75 years ago. It generates hundreds of
millions in annual revenue, according to one financial analyst. Clients of Gopher Resource
have included the U.S. military, battery makers and ammunition suppliers. The factory is about
six miles east of downtown Tampa, next to a CSX rail yard, a half a mile from Kenly

Elementary. Its smokestacks tower above the community of small residential homes, auto
repair shops and places of worship, just to place it for a visual to let people know that there’s a
community that’s surrounding this plant.
Johnson: Yes, it’s a very old community, a once-very-proud community. The community is
going through a little bit of a demographic change. Some of their people have gotten older. A
lot of people have left because of the smelter. But yes, it is a very active and vibrant
community right next door to a lead smelter. There’s an elementary school that is a stone’s
throw away, if you will, from the smelter.
And so much so, that if you go to the school, one of the government’s pollution air
monitors is right there next to a slide where children play. So the children’s playground is right
next to a government air pollution machine that is actually calculating how much lead is in the
air that’s getting through to that school. It just makes it very real.
If you were to go out to the plant at any given time, there are these huge trucks that are
driving around spraying water in the air and on the ground, with the idea that they are trying to
keep whatever lead has fallen down onto the ground wet. So the wind can’t pick it up and blow
it into someone’s face or blow it into someone’s yard. So yeah, the idea that a lead smelter
could be plopped in the middle of a community was really fascinating and intriguing. It was a
point that we ultimately dug into separately.

Industrial work environment
Aguilar: As you report, more than 300 people work at the Tampa location. Many are Black or
immigrant. Some came to the plant without a diploma or straight from high school, others as
they restarted their lives after arrests or time in prison. The job offered about $20 an hour with
some bonuses, more money than some workers believe their circumstances would allow. So
tell us more about these workers and what an average day is like. They’re long days, about 12hour days?
Johnson: Actually, The plant never closes. It’s a 24-hour operation. There are two shifts, a
day shift and an overnight shift. There are people in that building constantly working on
creating lead at all times of the day and night. The workers are mostly men.
The younger men get there either because they graduated high school or left school
and needed a little straight job to work. There’s some college kids who need some extra
money and are doing it on the side. But the bulk of the workforce are older men, either guys
who stubbed their toe in life. Maybe they went to jail or their education wasn’t that great, and
as such don’t have a lot of the options that someone else who didn’t have a blemish would
have.
There's a bunch of workers who have come from other countries – Haiti, the Caribbean,
some continental African workers, Cubans, Puerto Ricans – all who have come to America
looking for a better opportunity to be able to feed their family and send money back. They too
have been attracted to the job. Your average person would avoid a job like that because it's
hot. Everyone there is wearing spacesuits. They almost look like something out of Star Wars.

They’re wearing hazmat-type suits, with these big respirators to cover their face to keep the
dust and the toxins from creeping in.
You can imagine how hot one of those suits would be over their regular clothes, but
then you put them around a fiery furnace where the heat up there is rising and the furnace is
running well over 1,000-some degrees. It's dusty, it's nasty. It's often not air-conditioned. The
company has tried to improve the air conditioning over time, but a lot of days, the air
conditioning isn't working properly.
The ventilation system is supposed to be sucking the dust in the lead that's being
created. It creates this residue, so when they're breaking apart the batteries, there's a lot of
acid and muck and stuff that flies up in the air and it flies around. When they're actually
recovering the lead from the batteries and putting them into the furnace, there's a lot of this
dust that almost looks like dirt. But it's lead that gets created and is spewing in the air.
Toxic health consequences
Johnson: That environment is very, very dangerous because it's not just lead in that dust. It's
also other toxins, cadmium and arsenic. Arsenic is used to try to refine the lead at another
stage in the process. Arsenic and cadmium are cancer-causing. So those respirators are
crucial to being able to keep the workers safe.
What we found in the story was that oftentimes the levels were hundreds of times higher
than what the federal limit was, and on most days – on many days – the levels will be well
beyond what the respirators could protect against.
On many days the workers are working, they’re thinking they’re being protected and
they're literally breathing in all of those toxins and all those chemicals. And the medical tests
that are required to be done by the federal government for a company to operate around this
kind of stuff – the federal government requires a regular set of testing; it requires a doctor to be
contracted to look at this stuff and to ensure that the workers aren't getting sick because of
their exposure – our story found that this entire system had collapsed.
And so as the workers were getting more and more of these toxins in their bloodstream,
and the medical testing was showing that, the doctor was essentially looking the other way.
When they started to have clear health effects, kidney tests that were showing problems with
their kidneys, tests that were showing their blood pressure rising up and other problems, the
doctor would just essentially ignore it, check it off as clinically insignificant, and send them
back into the workspace without any real warning or taking any steps to protect their health.
Worse, as the company was doing their testing and these reports were showing these
astronomical levels and their workers were getting higher and higher blood lead results, when
workers would get sick or they would talk to the company about it, instead of saying, “Yeah,
you're working around an area where the level is 20 times higher than your respirator,” the
company will blame the worker and say, “Well, you must not be cleaning; you must not be
doing something right.”
In some cases, they will write the worker up and punish them for not keeping their blood
lead levels within a certain range. And so, it was amazing to see all of this happening. What
was also shocking was until we started to piece it together, the workforce had no idea that the
levels were too high. They had no idea that they were getting written up and punished, when in
fact, it didn't matter what they did.
They were ingesting too much of those toxins, and it was going to do some real damage
to them. There were people who even died. We found at least 14 workers, just within a five-

year period, that had heart attacks or strokes as a result, who also had high lead counts in
their blood.
We counted about 16 children. The environment was so dusty that some of the workers
were taking that dust home on the bottom of their shoes, or it crept into the back of their skin or
their hair. They would take it home and the baby would hug them or the baby would play
somewhere where the dust had gotten tracked in, then the baby would get poisoned.
There were at least 16 kids, but that's an undercount. There were far more children that
got exposed and ended up having some consequences. In some cases, we found that children
had blood lead levels that were higher than their father as a result of getting this exposure, and
so there were real consequences that were happening as a result of what the company was
doing and not doing.
Importance of video evidence
Aguilar: You described in great detail what it’s like for these workers to be inside this factory
with these hazmat suits. And in the first part of the series, there’s this horrific video that was
taken in 2019. I mean, it’s just amazing to see this worker who is pretty much just covered in
what looks like plumes of smoke. I understand you all found out that that’s actually a plume of
lead. I mean you can’t even imagine being in that environment and what that would do to your
body.
Johnson: Yes, what’s weird was that there was so much of that kind of evidence that workers
saw on a daily basis. They thought it was cool to look at, and so they took little pictures of it or
a video on their phone and had no idea that it wasn’t supposed to be like that, that it was a
dangerous situation that shouldn’t have existed. What was crucial for us was getting that video
and being able to put it all together so people could see. It was nothing for a worker to say,
“Well, we can’t see in there. There’s so much of the dust in the air that you have to walk slowly,
because you literally can’t see in front of you.”
I thought that was hyperbole. I thought that maybe some people were pulling my coat,
until they turned over that video. And you absolutely can’t see on many days because it’s that
crowded, it’s that polluted. The air is just covered in that stuff.
That video we have in part one of the series, the worker there was telling us, “Look, the
ventilation system does not work as good as it’s supposed to, and that dust cloud that you see
actually sits in that room for a good 30 or 45 minutes before it actually dissipates.” All of that is
lead.
And the reason why it was horrifying for me and our team was because when we were
doing the lead-in-water report, the scientists were telling us that it only took two Starbucks
coffee grain-sized pieces of lead to permanently brain damage a child. If you can imagine, it
only takes a little bit of that poison to do a lot of harm. You see a video showing this avalanche.
It just kind of drives home the danger and the peril that the workers were in.
Reporting challenges
Johnson: I have to say this too about the reporting process of this — it wasn’t easy. We had
to deal with the fact that this is a private company and the regular tools that reporters use to
get information, using what are called Freedom of Information Act laws, where we can write a
request up to a government agency, ask for some information under these laws, and the

government generally will turn them over, or at least they’re required to turn them over in
accordance with the law. Well, that tool doesn’t apply to a private company.
We couldn’t send a request over the Gopher Resource asking for all this information
because by law, they’re private. They don’t have to do that. We thought that the government
might have some information, so we sent some records requests there. And the government
was completely unhelpful.
We fought them for well over a year. And by the time we got something there, their little
black markers had blacked it out, so it looked like they played tic-tac-toe with those reports.
They really didn’t turn over anything of any real consequence. It was a conundrum. How do we
piece together exactly what’s happening at this plant?
So ultimately, reaching out to as many workers we could find was the way in, but that
had its own challenges. I’m a Black reporter, as you know, most people who know my work
and who can Google me and see. And the plant is predominantly Black or Black immigrants.
So, on its face, you might think that I would have had an easy time. But that wasn’t the case at
all. Largely, for two reasons.
One, the plant had a very heavy — and still does — a surveillance system, where they
have cameras everywhere, and they had workers who oftentimes reported back to
management on every conversation they heard. For a lot of these workers, this is their second
chance, or this is a job they’re proud of because it’s allowing them to make good money for
their family. They didn’t want to do anything that could jeopardize that or cause themselves to
be out of favor with management. That was one piece.
The other piece: there’s this really bad history around Black professionals who work for
white institutions that I kept running into over and over again, and it was a huge challenge to
overcome it.
Community-engaged reporting
Johnson: You know, in the Black community, this is not a secret but it’s not talked about that
often. In the past, when there were institutions that didn’t do the community good — whether it
was the insurance, or doctors doing experiments, or the police, or whatever else. They would
oftentimes send Black people into the community to do harm, to sell the bad meat, to sell the
bad insurance policy, infiltrate the civil rights organization or give the unnecessary surgery and
now you have no foot but you came in because your throat was sore.
There’s all these real-life horror stories of Black professionals who were not operating
for the best interests of the community. I had a hard time initially trying to convince people that
I wanted to interview that I was not the FBI.
I would go to the door and knock on the door because folks were not answering phone
calls or random text messages or random emails or Facebook. So, I’d have to go and knock on
the door and introduce myself. People were like, “Man, if you don’t get your little FBI ass off
around here,” and I would say, “Hey, I’m not the FBI. I’m Corey Johnson, I’m with the Tampa
Bay Times.” And they’d be like, “Same difference.”
So, there were a lot of shut doors. There was a lot of avoidance. In fact, when I started
to break through, it was because there were a few folks who had gotten their records and
shared their records and began to believe in what we were doing, who spoke up on our behalf.
That built over time. It didn’t happen initially. But it built up.
And when I say “got their records,” we discovered within the federal rules that workers
had this ability to get the pollution testing and the medical testing from a company where a

member of the public could not. So, we began to ask various workers if they’d be willing to get
their records and share it with us. That’s how we discovered the incredibly high levels and the
stuff that the doctor was doing and not doing. That’s how we first discovered it, that some
workers got their records and shared them with us.
We then, with their permission, were able to take some of those pieces to some of the
more reluctant workers and ask if they would be willing to give me five minutes to explain that I
wasn’t selling anything. I wasn’t the IRS. I wasn’t the police. I was not Immigration. There
wasn’t going to be a $49.99 offer at the end of this.
Instead, it was just us trying to figure out the reason why they keep going to the hospital
every couple of weeks. Because the one unifying thing that was happening to almost
everybody in that plant was they would end up in the hospital with some type of ailment that
could be linked to the lead or the cadmium that they were being exposed to.
The narrative of Prospere Dumeus
Aguilar: I mean, the stories that you all tell are heartbreaking. You've got photos in the piece.
Just a couple examples:
Kevin Lewis’s heart pounded so hard and fast while he worked in the furnace
department. The 26-year-old – he’s only 26 – couldn't catch his breath. He was whisked away
by an ambulance.
Larry Wheeler became disoriented and fainted, while working in one of the dustier areas
of the plant. An ambulance rushed the 39-year-old to the hospital, where medical staff told him
to limit his exposure to lead.
James Pitts, 49, blacked out with an erratic heart rate as he walked from the locker
room to start his maintenance shift. He was taken by paramedics to the hospital.
Story after story. Do you want to spend a little time telling us about Prosper Dumas?
Johnson: Yes. Prospere Dumeus was a Haitian worker who immigrated from Haiti and ended
up in Tampa, Florida, doing what a lot of immigrants do, they were looking for a better life.
They were looking for opportunity. He lived on the island of Haiti that was tremendously poor.
And his sister, Madeline, had come to America first in the early 80s. She had sent for him as
an option. And so he came. He got a job at the plant. It became his life. I think he worked well
over 32 years at that plant.
He was one of those guys that became like a specialist, where there was nothing
Dumeus couldn't do. He could drive the loaders. He was very fast. So much so that he enjoyed
some seniority and respect in the plant because if people had a problem or something they
didn't know, they would go to Dumeus, and he would tell them the workaround. He’d tell them
the fix to whatever the problem was, and management loved him.
He and a lot of the Haitian workers would go above and beyond. If the task requires
them to work eight hours, they’re gonna work 12. If they must work 15, they’re gonna work 18.
It was just what they did in their approach to work.
The downside to that was he was getting injured often. That hot molten lead would
splash, from time to time, and that plant would have regular explosions. Hot lead and water do
not go together well. If it rained and the building had leaks and water was leaking to the
building, it would be hit somewhere where that lead was, and it would cause an explosion.
Some people would be running because of the lead explosions that were happening. Dumas
got caught a few times with lead explosions, so his body was greatly scarred.

At one point, he suffered a lead explosion in the ’90s that hit like the entire side of his
body. He struggled with that for the rest of his life, because his injuries never really healed
from that. He also, in the early ’90s, started to deal with real heart problems as a result of his
exposure. I mean, Dumas had levels that far exceeded what the CDC now considers –
perhaps eight, nine times higher than what the CDC now considers to be high.
One point I want to make, too, about the story: This story also documents that the
federal government's limit on how much lead someone can safely have in their body is way too
high, and the government knows about it. Scientists know about it. Medical officials know
about it. But because that high level is so treasured by companies who do this kind of work,
they don't want to see that level come down. Because if it comes down, it will require them to
spend billions more on safety for workers.
Because of that, those levels have been set at the same levels as when they were first
created in light in the late 1970s. Even though science and medicine demand that they come
down because they're still way too high.
Dumeus was a victim of this. His levels, which were in the 40s – which are insane in the
eyes of the medical community – but in terms of the federal government's limit, he wasn't
hitting 60. Therefore, on paper, he could look safe when he was not. And one of the things we
wanted to show was how the federal government doesn't take into account the cumulative
amount of lead a human can be exposed to and what kind of damage it could do.
And so, Rebecca Woolington reached out to an expert who has been doing a lot of the
cutting-edge research on cumulative exposure. The expert worked with us to come up with a
formula where we could then take all of his medical tests and plug it into the formula to get a
sense of how much lead Dumeus had been exposed to. And the number was astronomical. It
was akin to eating a poison pill every day of his life for well over 30-some years. So that
amount was part of why he ended up having many heart surgeries.
When you looked at Dumeus, you would have never known that this man and his heart
were so damaged. I mean, he was a strong-looking man, very much in shape. On the inside,
the lead had just been eating away at his cardiovascular systems and his kidneys, and other
systems. Right around 2017, he had another heart surgery. After that surgery, his doctor
suggested that he not be made to lift anything over 20 pounds.
It was at that point the company decided to fire him. He begged for his job. It was the
only job he knew. His sister wanted him to leave the business because it was killing him, and
she said as much. But he was so drawn to the work and the camaraderie, he did not want to
leave.
Then when the company pushed him out, because he was essentially of no use to them
anymore, he went into a deep depression. Maybe a month or so after he was terminated, he
was at church, and he had this massive heart attack.
One of the real tragic pieces of that was as he lay on the ground in church, a lot of the
folks knew where he worked, so they did not want to give him CPR. They didn't want to put
their lips on him because they too were concerned about being contaminated.
By the time the paramedics got to him, he was still alive, but he suffered real significant
brain damage. That brain damage resulted in him having sudden seizures where he would just
shake uncontrollably and very violently. Ultimately, it led him to being placed into a home, and
then ultimately he died. And he died in his 50s. It’s tragic. And he's not the only one.

Even after the story’s published, you know, I've gone to funerals of other veterans at the
plant that we didn't get a chance to report on, who too had long exposure to this lead, so much
so but yet they came underneath the federal rules of what was safe and unsafe.
What’s changed?
Aguilar: That this was happening – officials said they didn't know what was happening – is it
safe to assume that this is happening in some of the other recycling factories? And what has
really changed in Gopher Resource?
Johnson: Well, yes. These levels are impacting everyone that's in the lead business. The
American Public Health Association, after seeing the story, wrote a letter to OSHA, which is
the Occupational Health and Safety Administration, calling for them to read the stories and to
bring those levels down. OSHA says they're looking at doing so. They've created a process
where they're taking comments from the community as they try to figure out what changes
they're going to make. Absolutely, this is a problem that's impacting other folks. And this story,
it was more than just that.
There was that piece, but then there were other things like housekeeping rules that the
company was violating that OSHA came in and absolutely is trying to hold them accountable.
And the county regulators have deemed – they have not only fined the plant, but they’re
requiring the plant to hire an expert to get the ventilation system together and to bring in new
technology that will immediately communicate with the government when systems begin to fail.
And so, there is a push to get Gopher much safer.
The other piece too is there’s a ton of lawyers out here now, including famous civil rights
attorney, Benjamin Crump. He was Trayvon Martin's attorney, and he's been serving as the
attorney for a lot of the victims of these police shootings. He has signed up a bunch of workers
and they have already filed one lawsuit. They say other lawsuits may be filed in the days and
weeks ahead.
There's a big push to make sure that what happened at Gopher never happens again,
both civilly and with government regulators.
Aguilar: Corey, thank you so much for your incredible work. Thank you for joining us.
Johnson: Thank you for having me.
