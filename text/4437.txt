Session Overview
● Launching the data story
● Bulletproofing and accuracy
● Presentation and engagement
● Q&A

Introduce and describe

Launching the data story
Brainstorming
What do you want to show?
What do you need to get?
How to go about getting it

Bullet-proofing the data story
● DON’T WAIT til the bullet-proofing process
to discuss the analysis plan. You want to
understand it as thoroughly as the reporter.
This is just as important as talking with a
reporter about a reporting plan.
● Ask for regular updates. Ask “what’s
changed?”

Bullet-proofing the data story
● Does the reporter have a sherpa inside the
organization that gathered the data?
● How complete is the data? Are key facts
missing?
● Do the keepers of the data understand how
you intend to use it?
● What data integrity checks did the data
reporter run?

Bullet-proofing the data story
● Does the reporter have an analysis log and
can you understand the steps involved?
● Outliers look like news. They often are
mistakes.
● Has an outside expert reviewed the
analysis?

Bullet-proofing the data story
● Can the reporter trace a few findings all the
way back to individual submissions or
forms?
● Editors should understand all the
assumptions embedded in the analysis.
● One math mistake can cause hundreds or
thousands of errors.

Bullet-proofing the data story
● Make time to share data fully with any
investigative “targets.”
● Consider reading back key portions of the
story as you approach publication.
● Consider a verification process to test all
findings with all covered organizations if
there are many. (Mail merge..)

Bullet-proofing the data story
● Build in time for extensive data checking.
This should not be the last thing before
publication. Something will change.
● If you get new insight or knowledge in final
fact-checking, consider pushing back
publication.
● Check all parts of the story (databases,
videos, graphics, etc)

Bullet-proofing the data story
● If you don’t understand the nerd box,
readers won’t either.
● Anticipate the criticism. Address it in the
story.
● No surprises.

Presentation and engagement
