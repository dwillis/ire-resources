Five Reasons Why
Algorithmic Accountability
Is Hard

Five Reasons
1. Information Deficits
2. Sociotechnical Assemblages
3. Temporal Instability
4. Expectation Setting
5. Legal Barriers

INFORMATION DEFICITS
External auditing may suffer
from knowledge gaps
Omitted variable bias
Mechanism identification
difficult from observational studies
Cooperating target still
controls access

SOCIOTECHNICAL
Intertwined assemblages of
algorithms and people
Feedback loops reflect /
amplify human behavior
Notion of responsibility
diffused through complexity

INSTABILITY
Dynamic systems that can
change at almost any time (or not)
Randomness and probabilistic
behavior
Tradeoffs between sampling rates
and resources for auditing
Conveying results dynamically,
beyond monitoring dashboards

EXPECTATIONS
What should be the behavior
of an algorithm?
Where does that
expectation come from?
How do we define that and
measure it quantitatively?

LEGAL FRICTION
Public records laws (e.g. FOIA)
and accessibility of government
algorithms
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act
(CFAA) and chilling effects on
audits
