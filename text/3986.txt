Make Your
Investigations Mobile

THINK DIGITAL FROM THE START

You can’t get there on your own.
It takes a team.

Who needs to be on board?
 Get support from bosses – they can throw their weight
behind it
 Show them it’s a story with wide reach and big impact
 And show them how you’re already focused on
mobile/tablet and desktop experiences

The Brainstorm
 At outset pull together key players: developer, social
media editor, photo-video, interactive graphic artist,
producers, others who get it

 Let them HELP you envision the best ways to tell stories
in platforms
 Editors & Directors: DEMAND that the storytelling starts
with a digital plan

Do you need outside help?
 If you don’t have all the expertise in house, where can
you find help?
 Partner with a university?
 Touch base with nonprofit investigative orgs?
 Can you borrow corporate talent?
 Do you have a Joe?

Break down the elements
 During brainstorms, discuss pieces you have – the
avenues you plan to explore
 Data?
 Docs?
 Visual opps?
 Geo-positioning possibilities?
 Utility tools for your audience?

IT CAN BE SIMPLE

Or a little more complicated

OR COMPLEX AND DEEP
 Can you create an app? Does it add more layering to
your project – stand on its own?

 Great example: “On Shaky Ground’’

 Something built with swipe approach – Ipad/phone in
mind – like “Ghost Factories”

“On Shaky Ground”

“Ghost Factories”

FINALLY...

HOW ARE YOU
GOING TO
PROMOTE?
