What can I do with complaints

2 sets of complaint data
• = 4-day series on errors in credit reports
• = 3-day series on debt collection
• = 3-day series on student loans
• = 1-day quick hit on a rogue debt collector

Squeaky wheels
• Judgment from a
delinquent payday
loan on her credit
report
• The only matching
data – the names
• She’s a lawyer

Identity stolen at age 14

At 94, she owes $75k in student
loans

Vetting complaint data
• Tossed nearly 25 percent because they
were off point or too vague.
• Tossed any complaint that cited
"inaccuracies" without identifying the
source.
• Tossed duplicates and/or multiple filers.
• “Matched” against other studies.

Analysis
• Demographic inaccuracies.
• Inaccuracies about debts the consumers
owed.
• Debts consumers did not owe.
• Problems accessing free credit reports or
reaching a human.
• Issues related to the error-dispute process.
• Discrepancies in credit scores
