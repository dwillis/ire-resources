International Networking
Investigative Reporting in Asia

Asia has a booming media market, brought about by increasing prosperity, the rise of the
middle class and growing public demand for news and information. China and India are
today the largest newspaper markets in the world and newspaper circulation in these and
several other Asian countries continues to grow, defying global trends. Television, radio
and the Web are enjoying unprecedented audiences as well.
There are tremendous opportunities for journalistic networking in Asia. It is certainly a
growth area for investigative reporting, which is taking place in both big and small
media, mainstream news outlets, as well as citizen journalist sites.
