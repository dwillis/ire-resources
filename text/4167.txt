Research Secret
o Think about what your answer will look like.
o Who will have the answer/document?
o What format? Spreadsheet, letter, etc.
o What keywords will be in your answer?
Facebook
o Identify a Facebook account with “Find My Password” and a phone, email or username.
Obviously, don’t generate the email to change the password.
o Click on Members link of a Closed Group to find the Admins.
o You can also direct message people who aren’t your friends in Facebook for $1. Just click
on “See More” when you’re trying to send a message.
Google+
o Search Google+ through Google:
o site:plus.google.com works at “structure tone” lives in “new york”
Geofencing & Geolocation
o live.echosec.net ($): draw a perimeter and identify real-time social media within that circle.
o Geofeedia.com ($$): draw a perimeter and identify real-time social media within that circle.
