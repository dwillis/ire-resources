Building your own databases:
•
•

•

•

Learn how to build Forms in Microsoft Access. These are web-like pages that make data
entry easier. A simple one can be built using the Wizard. Once built, these are easy to use
even for someone who is deathly afraid of a database!
For more advanced Forms — including error-proofing and automation — learn about
pull-down menus (Combo Boxes) and some basic coding using Visual Basic for
Applications (VBA). VBA is the computer language that Access uses for all its buttons
and point-and-click functions. Learning this allows you to customize your database to
make it do whatever you want. Classes at a local community college would be a good
way to learn this.
Keep in mind that databases can be used solely as a means of organizing your
information. The order you put the information into the system doesn’t matter, but the
database allows you to export it or sift through it in whatever order you want.
Sports ideas for build-it-yourself: high school coaches’ salaries; college coaches’ salaries;
historical NCAA tournament records for local colleges; attendance figures for local
college or professional games; details about arena or stadium project (finances,
contractors, etc).

Indexes:
•
•
•

•

A tool for combining a series of measures. Allows you to rank people/places/things based
on multiple criteria. Especially useful for sports where no one statistic is representative of
a player’s ability or value.
Indexes are subjective. The index creator decides what to include (or not) and whether
one thing should be weighted higher than another.
Variety of ways to build an index. A basic, non-weighted type is to rank each player in
each of the categories that make up the index, then add up the rankings to get a “score.” If
you rank them with 1 being the highest, then the person with the lowest score comes out
on top. (you could reverse this, so that your rankings use 1 as the lowest rank).
To build a weighted index, each player would have a value in each category. Then
multiply that value times your weight (you might weight just one category, or have a
different weight for each category). Then add up the newly-weighted values for each
category to get a final “score.” The highest score would come out on top.

Some data sources that are integral to sports:
High school participation surveys: Your state high school association surveys its member
schools every year and that information is sent on to the National Federation of State High School
Associations, http://www.nfhs.org/
Information is at summary level -- total number of girls statewide playing soccer, for example.
This survey covers about 90% of U.S. public and private high schools. Surveys go back to the
1970s. Links to all state high school associations are at:
http://www.nfhs.org/scriptcontent/Va_Custom/Directory/MemberDirectory.cfm
College Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act Data (EADA): Under Title IX, all colleges and
universities receiving federal funds must file this report. Since 2001, the reports have been filed
electronically and are available in a database. A searchable version of the database is located at:
http://www.ope.ed.gov/athletics/
Data includes participation numbers, numbers and average salaries for coaches, revenues and
expenditures for each sport.
Integrated Post-Secondary Education System Data (IPEDS): A monster database from the
Dept of Education. Entire database can be downloaded from the Web. For each school, you’ll
find things such as enrollment by race/ethnicity; revenue and expenditure by source of income
and type of expense; salaries of FT instructional faculty by academic rank and tenure status;
completions by type of program, level of award, race/ethnicity and gender; and many other
details. Nothing specific to athletics, however this might be a supplement to something you do
regarding colleges. http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/
