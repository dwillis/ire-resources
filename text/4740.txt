Hands on with health data
NICAR 2016

(This tipsheet can be found at ​

)
For our hands on class, we will be working with three different data sets
released by the ​
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services​
(CMS). Medicare is
the federal public health insurance program for the elderly and disabled.
Medicaid is a state­federal public health insurance program for the poor.
The data for this session are available in this folder:

Dataset #1: CMS­Nursing­Home­Health­Deficiencies.xlsx
These are violations cited by nursing home inspectors against homes
nationwide. They include citations from the past three inspection cycles (a cycle
is typically one year). It can be found on this page:
https://data.medicare.gov/data/nursing­home­compare​
and specifically at this
link: ​
https://data.medicare.gov/Nursing­Home­Compare/Deficiencies/r5ix­sfxw​
.
For this particular task, we’ve only selected health deficiencies to analyze (we’ve
removed fire safety deficiencies to make the table size more manageable.)
For your reference:
* Cycle 1 includes the last comprehensive inspection and the prior 12 months of
all complaint inspections.
* Cycle 2 includes the 2nd most recent comprehensive inspection and all
complaint inspections 13­24 months ago.
* Cycle 3 includes the third prior comprehensive inspection and all complaint
inspections between 25­36 months ago.

. For this assignment,
you want the “deficiencies” tab.
For this assignment​
, we will be using pivot tables to glean insights into the data,
and let you customize your search to your local area.
Dataset #2: CMS­PartB­2013­InternalMed.xlsx
In 2014, CMS began releasing data on the services provided by (and payments
given to) doctors and others in the Medicare fee­for­service program. This data
was released after the ​
Wall Street Journal successfully sued​
to lift an injunction
that had kept it private for decades. The data is available in the aggregate (i.e.
total services provided by each doctor and total payments received by that
doctor) and in a granular fashion (which services and treatments did the doctor
perform).
For this task, we’ve selected internal medicine doctors and we’re looking at data
in the aggregate. The data is from the year 2013. It can be found here:
https://www.cms.gov/research­statistics­data­and­systems/statistics­trends­and
­reports/medicare­provider­charge­data/physician­and­other­supplier.html​
and
specifically here:

_and_Other_Supplier_NPI_Aggregate_CY2013.zip​
.

.
For this assignment, ​
we will also be using pivot tables.
Dataset #3: CMS­Geographic­Variation.xlsx
Geographic variation in the use of Medicare services. This data set explores
differences by county (and state) in the use of Medicare fee­for­service

treatments. It can be found here:
https://www.cms.gov/Research­Statistics­Data­and­Systems/Statistics­Trends­a
nd­Reports/Medicare­Geographic­Variation/GV_PUF.html​
.
For this particular task, we will be using this table:
https://www.cms.gov/Research­Statistics­Data­and­Systems/Statistics­Trends­a
nd­Reports/Medicare­Geographic­Variation/Downloads/State_County_Table_All
.zip​
. And we have truncated the table to include only 2013 and 2014. The actual
table includes worksheets for years dating back to 2007. (​
Important note: This
does not include data from Medicare Advantage, which is quite popular in some
areas.​
)
For this assignment,​
we will go over sorting, filtering and VLOOKUP. We’ll also
talk about the importance of comparing measures over time.

Using lookups in Excel
One of the most powerful tools in a database manager is the ability to join
tables. Excel has some tools that allow you to join data from multiple sheets.
In database #3, we’re going to use a tool called VLOOKUP, which will let us pull
data from 2013 into our chart for 2014.
First, we have to get our data ready to join. To do that,
1) Rename the spreadsheets at the bottom of your workbook. Name
“State_county 2013” as 2013 and “State_county 2014” as 2014. I did this
because Excel sometimes chokes on tab names that have spaces in them.
2) Separately, highlight all rows in each sheet, go to the Home tab, click
“Merge & Center,” then click Unmerge cells. The reason you want to do
this is because merged cells make it hard, if not impossible, to sort.
3) Once you’ve done this, you’ll want to delete Row 1 on both sheets. We
want to do this so that the column headers are in the first row.
4) Next, you’ll want to create a unique ID field upon which to match the
sheets. The State and county FIPS code could have been a unique ID field,
but as you look at it, you’ll see “.” in place of state and national averages.
Because there’s more than one “.” you’ll need to create a different unique
ID. So go to Column A, right click and insert a column on both the 2013
and 2014 worksheets. Call it “New state and county fips.” ​
NOTE: It is
necessary to put your unique key in column A for this to work.
5) You’ll now want to create your unique ID using an IF statement. Use this:
=IF(D2=".", B2&" "&C2, D2). Let’s parse that. We’re saying if the “State
and County FIPS” column (D) has a “.” in it, insert cells B2 and “[space]”
and C2 in its place. If it does not have a “.”in it, use cell D2.
6) Finally, once you’ve done this and copied it down for the whole column,
highlight the column, copy it and paste special with values. You’ll do this
to get rid of the formula and leave only the values.
This is what each spreadsheet will look like:

Now you are ready for the VLOOKUP.
We want to compare MA penetration in 2014 to 2013. They are in different
sheets. So you want to add a column to the right of column H, “MA Participation
Rate.” Call it “MA Participation Rate 2013.”
In cell I2, we’ll add our formula:
=VLOOKUP(A2, 2013!A$1:I$J3192,8,FALSE)
Let’s walk through this formula:
A2​
is the cell that contains the location ID in the 2014 file.
2013!A$1:I$J3192 is the range of cells in the spreadsheet called 2013. The dollar
signs are there because as you copy the formula down, Excel will want to
increment them. This prevents the formula from changing to A2:C112 and
A3:C113 and so on…

8​
is the column that contains the information you want to pull in, in this case
Medicare Advantage Participation Rate from 2013. The lookup code MUST be
the first column. You actually need to count the columns and not use the
column letter.
False​
means that your data has to match 100% (remember, nerds in closets
invented this software – it’s not always intuitive)
Just like with most formulas, copy it down to the bottom of the spreadsheet.
Check out what you’ll see.

You can now compare Medicare Advantage penetration in 2014 to the 2013 rate
without going back and forth among different spreadsheets.
With thanks to Jennifer LaFleur for the VLookup template.
