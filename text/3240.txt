The Art of the Interview:
How to do great interviews, on the fly or going deep
1) Focus on the story before the interview.
•
•
•
•
•

What’s my story? Be able to say it in a sentence or two. Refine it as you learn more.
How much time do I have for this interview, and for this story?
What do I already know about this person or topic?
What sources will help me report and tell this story?
How will I cultivate those sources, for this story and for the long term?

2) Prepare for the interview.

Why I am talking with this source?
What role will this source likely play in my story?
What type of interview is this – empathetic, informational, or confrontational?
What type of source is this – idealistic, victim, all business, or reluctant?
With time available (even five minutes), background yourself by talking to other sources, reading research,
data and others’ stories, and going to online sources including Lexis www.lexis.com and Google
www.google.com but especially The Reporter’s Desktop www.reporter.org/desktop.
Conduct interviews in person, when possible.
Select an interview site that involves action or reveals something about the person or issue. Strive to meet
reluctant sources on their own turf.
Be open to interviews at nights and on weekends.
Write questions, keeping in mind: “What will open this source up?”
Consider what would you ask the if the camera operator said, “Three questions. We're not burning tape
here.” These are your critical questions.
Practice key parts of the interview in your head while jogging, driving or showering.
Dress to blend in with your source and the scene.
Bring along key documents to cite details and to impress the source with your thoroughness.

Use a tape recorder or digital recorder, when possible, for accuracy and for critiquing your interviewing
skills.
Start with the easy stuff – name, age, family, biographical details.
Consider using a chronological approach – a natural storytelling format.
Be guided by your curiosity. Let the interview develop naturally, but refer back to your questions to make
sure you’re covering all key areas.
Embrace silence.
Listen lots, talk little.
Ask how the source knows the information. This is to check credibility and to seek additional sources.
Press for specifics, including anecdotes and data.
Probe for differences between the way things are supposed to work, and reality. This is at the heart of most
investigative reporting.
Try slo-mo interview techniques, switching to present tense for phrasing of questions. Begin with benign
queries, such as “What are you wearing?” and “What’s the weather like?” to help the source focus on key
times and events. It works for Pulitzer winner Eric Nalder, and it’ll work for you, too.
Know when to use an open-ended question, and when to use yes/no.
Pause and be sure you’re on track.
Source wants to go off the record? Be wary. Have a strategy.
“End” the interview; the source may relax and really start talking.
Ask the source whom else to interview, and what else to read.
Get contact information – and don’t hesitate to contact the source with follow-up questions. Source is
welcome to contact you with more information, too.

4) Look back – and ahead.

Keep learning by evaluating your work and by drawing upon great tips from Eric Nalder, John Ullmann,
Mike McGraw, Joe Stephens, Christine Willmsen, Jane Hansen, Mark Skertic, David Kay Johnston, Diana
Henriques, Michael Berens and other IRE members whose ideas appear here and on other tipsheets at
www.ire.org/resourcecenter.
Check back through your notes to clear up any loose ends.
Be critical of your performance: Did you miss any opportunities? Did you talk too much?
File open-records requests, track down data and figure out where you should go next.
Cultivate the source by checking back after the story appears and continuing to build a relationship based
on trust and respect.
