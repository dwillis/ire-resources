Look at annual reports for pipelines you cover. This can tell you how many leaks
they've had, whether they've replaced pipe, and much more
https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/source-data

NOTE: with spills and annual reports, it is helpful to download and refer to the
PDF form that companies use to fill out the forms. The annual report form is pretty
confusing. Also, sometimes you are shifted to Oracle to view PHMSA data. This
does not work in Chrome. Use Firefox or Explorer
Finding out where your pipelines are:
https://pvnpms.phmsa.dot.gov/PublicViewer/
The National Pipeline Mapping System (NPMS) Public Viewer will show federally
regulated pipelines, LNG plants and some federally regulated storage tanks. But it
shows it only one county at a time. It also shows accidents and incidents back to
2002. It does not show smaller pipelines, like the ones running to houses.

OSHA and BLS, Labor Department data
When looking up labor department data on safety, employment, salaries etc. in
drilling be careful. There's not one easy classification for the industry, commonly
referred to as "upstream oil and gas."
"researchers generally define it as the three industry groups from two different
subsectors in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Oil and Gas
Extraction (NAICS 211), Drilling Oil and Gas Wells (213111), and Support Activities for
Oil and Gas Operations (213112)"​ ​https://www.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/cfoi/osar0018.htm

"support activities" is a huge part of the business. "Oil and Gas extraction" is very
small and excludes much of the dangerous and dirty work.

Key online resources
● Nuclear Regulatory Commission
○ ADAMS​ Public Documents Database
■ Home to almost every public document held by the NRC
■ Select “Begin WBA Search” this stands for “Web Based ADAMS”
■ On the “Advanced Search” tab, you can search by Docket Number
■ Each nuclear reactor has its own docket number, you can find those ​here
■ Then do additional search based on keyword, date or title
■ Can call the ​help line​ for any questions, usually helpful and seperate from
the public information staff
● 1-800-397-4209 or 301-415-4737
○ Environmental Reports
■ There are two types of annual reports related to environmental monitoring
that each plant must file - both can be found here
● Annual Radioactive Effluent Reports
○ Lists the total radioactive materials that leave the plant each
year
○ Can compare this from year to year to see any trends
○ Can be confusing to interpret, if you see something that
looks like an outlier, always ask an outside expert to
confirm your findings
● Annual Radiological Environmental Operating Reports (sometimes
just called Environmental Reports)
○ Looks at the radioactive influences on the surrounding
environment
○ Lists any incidents that lead to accidental or unplanned
releases of radioactive material
○ Contains the “Groundwater Protection Program Report” at
the end - this is what would list any sort of tritium leak or
incidents where tritium contaminated groundwater
○ Reports Associated With Events
■ Two main types of reports:

● Event Notification Reports
○ Often are about minor events, or first notification of events
that later develop into more serious incidents
○ A good way to see how something was first reported
○ Can check back in the archives going to 1999
● Preliminary Notification Reports
○ Much less frequent than Event Notification Reports
○ Have to do with incidents that “are of significant safety or
safeguards concern or have high public interest,” according
to the NRC
○ Can search going back to 2003
○ Statistics on Allegations
■ Allegations are complaints received by the NRC from NRC employees,
plant employees, plant contractors, or license applicants
■ Statistics show how many were received by each plant per year
■ For more information, you can FOIA for all of the allegations in your
state, or for a particular plant
■ A subset of the allegations data is “Discrimination Allegations.” These are
plant employees who claim they were discriminated against for raising
safety concerns at a plant. There is data available from the same link on
just discrimination complaints. Nuclear power employees can file
whistleblower complaints through the NRC this way, and can also file
with the DOL. If you FOIA the NRC for the complete case file for some
of these, there are often DOL case numbers or other identifying features
that will then allow you to FOIA the DOL for the corresponding case file.
If the DOL case has been appealed, you can often find the whistleblower’s
name in the files, which the NRC does not release.

Helpful Sources
● David Lochbaum - Union of Concerned Scientists
○ Very knowledgeable about all technical aspects of nuclear power
○ Writes an annual report on “near-misses” at nuclear power plants, meaning
incidents that increased the likelihood that the plant would experience a meltdown
by a magnitude of at least ten
● Billie Garde - The Law Firm of Clifford & Garde
○ Represents many whistleblowers from nuclear power plants
○ Has been involved in work with the nuclear industry for decades
○ Worked with the NRC to help develop their safety culture policy

Engage people on the ground to be citizen-videographers by buying them a cheap camera ​(easier
for storage than an iPhone) ​and develop a relationship where they send you footage (​teach them
to shoot!)
Make sure ATIP/FOI requests are mindful of audio and video (​ask for the AUDIO of the call or
video/photos of a site inspection)
If producing recreations, rent the ‘exact’ gear to bring an event to life
Tease apart one event from your database that you can humanize - to represent the
theme/concerns of the people who live there … chase the human element as passionately as the
data!
Engage your company’s graphic artists to turn the complex into the understandable

NAPS: network for federal air monitors
https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/1b36a356-defd-4813-acea-47bc3abd859b
Each Cdn province hosts regional air monitors (not all of which are integrated into NAPS) ex.
Ontario: ​http://www.airqualityontario.com/aqhi/locations.php
Some industrial regions post the results from ​private air​ monitors: ​*note, they don’t always
monitor for the same pollutants!
http://www.sarniaenvironment.com/air-quality-air-monitoring-results-and-information-about-themonitored-substances/
New legislation in Ontario requires fenceline monitoring (other provinces are not there yet) - see
individuals corporate websites of specific companies for this info
NPRI - Data on Industrial Air Emissions (as modelled by companies - not ‘live’ data):
http://www.ec.gc.ca/inrp-npri/default.asp?lang%BCEn&;n%BC4A577BB9-1​ ***note, these
numbers don’t always include fugitive emissions, start-up/shut-downs and other adverse events
Look at shared airshed data (ex. Combine NPRI and TRI data to assess cumulative effect, where
applicable)

COLLABORATE!
Team up with other journalists/academic institutions to pull off complex investigations with the greatest
impact.
