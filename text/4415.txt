Getting Ready

 Think creatively

 What ELSE do I want to know about this

breaking news?
 What would help viewers/readers understand
this event more?
 What DON’T we know after the obvious “nuts
and bolts”?
 What will help our organization’s coverage
‘stand out’ from our competition?

How to Proceed
 What data might be available?
 How easily is it accessed?
 Is it in a form I can understand and analyze?
 How fast can I understand and analyze it?
 What value could it provide to our coverage?
 Where do I go?
 Find relationships, put event into context.
 Make my pitch.







Be ready BEFORE
breaking news hits
Practice using
databases during spare
time
Give yourself practice
exercises and
deadlines






Keep a special
database folder to turn
to when breaking news
hits
Use databases often
Know how to turn data
into interesting copy

Geofeedia.com
 Great new website that helps you locate pictures, video, and
other types of media around a particular location
 You pick the location, then posts will appear and you can
individually view them. Makes it easy to find pics & video of a
scene,
plus contact witnesses
 This site is new, but free to journalists. They should be
able to verify your credentials within a day, but better to sign
up before you need it


ALSO USE BANJO for smarthphone
Capture – https://www.capture.com/ brand new; just
launched last week, used by BuzzFeed, Time and Huff Post

Images.Google.com
 Not only can you use Google to look for images once you've
started a regular Google search, you can also do a reverse
image search
 When on the Google image website, just click on the camera
icon & upload your own pic. Then Google will scan the web
for other
sites that the image appears on
 This can help you confirm a person's identity, see if their
Facebook pic appears on other websites, or find out if a
picture is fake
or ripped off of another website

OpenStatusSearch.com
 Who needs to be Facebook friends when you have this
website?
When breaking news happens, use OpenStatusSearch.com to
see what people
are saying about an incident, person, or subject matter
 Can be used to find victims, witnesses, neighbors, etc. Just
click the person's name and send them a Facebook message or
use your
favorite phone number finder to locate their info

Web Archive (formerly Wayback Machine)
 Sometimes right after a breaking news event a company or
person will
pull down its website. Use a search engine's "Cache" function
to pull up
old versions of the page
 Check out http://archive.org/index.php for what used to be
called the
Wayback Machine to also get access to archived webpages
 This is also helpful to check for longer term investigations if
you're trying to see what a company used to advertise, get
old phone
numbers, etc.


City and School Employee Databases
 Get list from each jurisdictions in your area

Ask for first/middle/last names, salaries, date of hire
 Ask for department, position, age, home address, and gender
 Get data in spreadsheet form
 This can help you confirm details about an employee when
news
breaks (or in general backgrounding) when many times PIOs
refuse to
confirm a person's employment
 Have to get this ahead of time, but a great tool to have at
your disposal for breaking news and long term projects.
