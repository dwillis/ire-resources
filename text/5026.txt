“A Jetson Christmas Carol” (1985):
What do Santa Claus and George Jetson have in common? They both have to work on
Christmas eve! Mean, old Mr. Spacely forces George to work late, while his family wonders
what has happened to him. Astro opens one of his presents early and accidentally swallows a
piece (a Spacely Sprockett). He becomes very ill. It seems the Jetsons may lose their Tiny
Tim-like dog.
Mr. Spacely is visited by his old partner, Jacob Marsley, who [warns of three more] spirits to
come. First the ‘Past’ ghost robot, who reveals young Spacely picking on young George,
‘Present’ provides a vision of Astro’s death. ‘Future’ sees the Jetsons now very wealthy after
suing over Astro’s death.
When Spacely wakes up he's a changed man! A sadder, wiser, nicer and happier Cosmo
Spacely! At least until the next episode.

plural noun: bots

Bots are intelligent computer programs that chat (or
simulate a conversation) with users – providing
information in response to prompts. Sometimes they
are driven by humans, sometimes by computers – or a
mix of the two, but it’s really the conversational
interface that makes them different.
