Data J is in
demand

But few of us
are editors

Either we’re
horrible….

Or we don’t
have access

Data work =
Journalism

But does
leadership see
that?

30%
Feel our organizations don’t value our work

39%
Need editors who are qualified to supervise data journalists

So how do we fix this?

Tell leadership this is a problem

53%
Leave their job because a lack of a career path/ leadership
opportunities

40%
Leave because a lack of direction or leadership in the newsroom

Tell your co-workers you want to be an
editor

Share the research
Share this talk

Help others on this path
Share what you learn
If you want to get better, ask others for
help

Demand a seat at the table.
Journalism needs you
