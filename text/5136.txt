IN HIGHER EDUCATION RECORDS

Expect RESISTANCE!!


Public universities are frequently resistant to media scrutiny.



The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) will be used
in strange ways.



In most states, fundraising foundations are exempt from publicrecords laws, or their status is unclear. California made these records
public in 2011 after Sarah Palin’s $75,000 speaking fee was kept
secret.



Universities will cite other legal exemptions you’ve never heard of.

$500K for a beauty pageant?

Who can get you a clean copy?

What sources do your colleagues have?
Employees, from the secretary to the ex-president
Is there anyone else (city, county, state) who could have these records?
If FERPA is the issue, can the student request their own file?
Is there a lawmaker willing to request it for you?

Are student complaints covered by
FERPA?

Parting thoughts…


Attorneys aren’t just for lawsuits – a simple attorney phone call can
speed up the process, or prompt the release of unredacted records.



The largest public universities have the population and budget of a
small city – there’s lot of digging to be done.



Sometimes you’ll only get half a loaf – a redacted document that
contains a few clues. Can you use that information to file another
FOIA? Are there names on the document who you can contact?



Persistence is your greatest weapon.
