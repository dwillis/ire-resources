Copyrightability
•

The idea-fact/expression dichotomy
•

Copyright is NOT about:
•

Research and sweat of the brow

•

Discovery of facts

•

Unique interpretations or theories

Copyrightability
•

The idea-fact/expression dichotomy
•

Copyright IS about:
•

Original selection, arrangement, and
presentation of uncopyrightable facts or
ideas

Copyrightability

•

No protection for short phrases; e.g., headlines

•

De minimis uses

Authorship
• Who is an

“author”?
• Single author
• “Work for hire”:

employees,
certain
commissioned
works by written
agreement
• Joint authorship

Authorship

Copyright Registration
•

The relevance of registration
•

Registration is not a condition of copyright
protection

•

Attempt to register is necessary to sue for
infringement
•

•

Copyright Office must issue a decision

Registration is a prerequisite for certain remedies:
attorney’s fees and statutory damage awards

Copyright Registration
•

How do you register?
•

Online at https://copyright.gov/registration

•

Fees
•

Single work with single author ($35)

•

Other single works ($55)

•

Collected newspapers ($80)

•

Collected photographs ($55)

•

Collected contributions to periodicals ($85)

Copyright Registration
•

Should I consider registering my work?
•

Do you own it, or did you assign the copyright?
•

More on that later

•

Has infringement already occurred, or is it likely?

•

Do you need statutory damages, or is an
injunction sufficient?

Infringement
•

What constitutes infringement?
•

Actual copying required – coincidental
creation is not prohibited

•

Plaintiff must prove defendant had access to
the work allegedly copied

•

Must copy expression, and not merely ideas

Infringement
•

What constitutes infringement?
•

Direct/literal similarity

•

Substantial similarity of copyrightable
elements

Infringement
•

Copyright infringement is a “strict liability” tort
•

The plaintiff doesn’t need to prove that you
knew you were infringing

•

Doesn’t matter for liability if you thought you
had proper permission (more on this later)

•

Innocence might, in very limited circumstance,
cap damages

The Author’s Claim
•

Author writes book with an unusual premise or viewpoint

•

Author submits book to the publishing division of a major media
conglomerate, and is rejected

•

Three years later, the studio division of the conglomerate releases a
film based on the same viewpoint/premise

•

The film follows the general plot beats of the novel, with some very
similar scenes

•

The film goes on to win multiple Academy Awards

•

Does the author have an infringement claim vs. the studio?

Fair Use
•

Complex, judge-made exception to copyright

•

Intertwined with First Amendment issues

•

Includes of copying “for purposes such as
criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching …,
scholarship, or research”

Fair Use
•

Balancing test of four factors, none determinative:
1) the purpose and character of the use;
2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in
relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or
value of the copyrighted work.

Fair Use
•

Factor One: Purpose and character of the use
•

“Transformative” use
•

•

“Communicates something new and different
from the original or expands its utility, thus
serving copyright's overall objective of
contributing to public knowledge."

Commerical vs. non-commercial use

Fair Use
•

Factor One: Purpose and character of the use
•

Parody vs. satire

•

“A secondary author is not necessarily at liberty
to make wholesale takings of the original author's
expression merely because of how well the
original author's expression would convey the
secondary author's different message.”

Fair Use

Campbell v. Acuff-Rose (U.S. 1994)
(for-profit parody)

Fair Use

Fair Use

Fair Use
•

Brownmark Films, LLC v. Comedy Partners,
682 F.3d 687 (7th Cir. 2012)
•

“When the two works in this case are viewed
side-by-side, the South Park episode is clearly a
parody of the original WWITB video, providing
commentary on the ridiculousness of the original
video and the viral nature of certain YouTube
videos.”

Fair Use
•

Factor Two: Nature of the copyrighted work
•

Minor factor

•

Considered alongside Factor One in
determining whether use is transformative

•

Factual works less protected, but no
preference based on quality

Fair Use
•

Factor Three: Amount and substantiality of portion
used
•

Raw percentage vs. importance of excerpt

•

"The larger the amount, or the more important the
part, of the original that is copied, the greater the
likelihood that the secondary work might serve as an
effectively competing substitute for the original.”

Fair Use
•

Factor Four: Effect on the market for the original
•

Does the copy substitute for the original in the
marketplace, and to what extent?

•

Considers not only the market for the original work
but also possible derivative works

Fair Use

Harper & Row v. Nation Enters. (U.S. 1985)
(heart of the work)

Fair Use
•

Am I commenting on the original?

•

Is the material I’m sharing the the basis of the
story?

•

How much of the original do I actually need to
use?

•

Is a license available to purchase?

Licenses & Assignments
• Licenses vs. assignments
• Exclusive vs. non-exclusive licenses
• Other limitations on licenses: time, format,

geographic location, etc.
• Is permission the simplest defense to an

infringement claim?

Licenses & Assignments

Licenses & Assignments
• Mere availability online is not permission
• What about website terms of service?

•

Can you get permission?
