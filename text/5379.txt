• OLS: Ordinary Least Squares
Regression
• OTHERWISE KNOWN AS
LINEAR REGRESSION.

• How much does one variable
(INDEPENDENT) explains the
variation in another variable
(DEPENDENT).

• Poverty and school test scores
• Racial Demographics and Lottery
Spending

• RESULT = R-square.

• Allows us to “adjust” data.
• We can see if entities are doing
better or worse than they should,
given the independent variable.

WITH TEST SCORES
• Controls for poverty levels to see if
schools are doing better or worse
than expected, given their poverty
level.

• The regression calculation is
based on the formula for a line:

y=mx+b

• Y= PREDICTED SCORE.
• X= POVERTY RATE
• M= SLOPE –HOW MUCH A CHANGE IN
POVERTY EXPLAINS CHANGE IN SCORE.
• B= Y INTERCEPT-WHERE THE LINE
CROSSES THE Y AXIS.
