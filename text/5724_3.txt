Protecting
sources

Watergate brought the issue of naming sources to the public's attention.
Deep Throat's cover was protected until 2005, when Mark Felt outed
himself as the notorious whistle blower.
In extreme situations, if a source is named, it could result in them being
sacked, attacked or killed.

If people are brave enough to come forward we must protect them.
We must ensure our procedures are watertight.

Risk
Analyse the risk and cater for the threat posed to your story.
Assessment
General risk
Don't drop your guard
Choose manageable cover
IP tracing?
Loss of theft of a laptop, memory stick or phone

Hackers, lawyers, extremists &
investigators
Prepare for malware
Advanced SOCMINT & technical skills
Possible infiltration of online services
Prepare for subpoena of notes

Government & Intelligence services
SIGINT
Office raids & thefts. Seizure of computers
Seizure / copying data at airports & borders
Forensic recovery of deleted data
Pressure to reveal passwords

Leaving
Footprints

Every time we use the Internet we reveal information

Leaving
Footprints

This includes:
• Our IP Address, which itself might reveal
• Our country
• Our home town
• Our employer
• Links to previous activity
• The address of site we came from
• The words we typed into Google to get there
• Other factors about our devices that form a unique footprint

Leaving
Footprints

What you can do
• Use burner phone / sim card
• Use whatismyipaddress.com to see what your IP address is
• Use anonymous-proxy-servers.net to test for information leaks
• Use a secure online email service like protonmail.com
• If necessary don't do more sensitive research on the office
Internet
• Use VPNs to encrypt your connection and hide your IP
• Or use phone’s “personal hotspot” to get online
• Or go to somewhere *secure* with safe wifi

Protecting Data
Your accounts could be hacked, your laptop could be stolen. Your story
and source could be compromised should your data fall into the wrong
hands.
• Use encrypted storage on your laptops & memory sticks
• Wipe conversations in messaging apps before you delete
them
• Use up to date virus protection and updated browsers
• Use encryption software like Veracrypt to make secure files
• Encryption can cause data corruption so test decryption
• Keep backups
• Use software like ccleaner to securely delete information
• Limit data audience to essential parties only

Protecting Data
Beware of malware
• Avoid “guest wifi” – it’s possible for hackers to monitor every user’s
activity
• Only use secure https:// addresses to log in to accounts or buy things
• Make sure your browsers and operating systems are up to date
• Make sure you have anti-virus software on your computer
• Make sure you also have it on your mobile device
• Especially if you have an Android device
• Beware of “keylogging” hardware and software
• Check the end of the keyboard cable and USB ports for any
unexpected devices
• Don’t use other peoples’ devices to log in to sensitive accounts

Protecting Communications
Make life difficult for anyone investigating you
•
•
•
•
•
•

Don’t use your normal user names and accounts
Use new email addresses / sim cards
Tell sources not to talk about the story to anyone
Use easy encrypted messaging apps like Signal
Don’t force sources to use complicated encryption
Use VPNs on all devices

Protecting Communications
Choosing the right passwords
•
•
•
•
•
•

Pick a long pass phrase, rather than a short password
Hackers use programs with dictionaries to guess passwords
So don’t just pick a normal word + number password
Don’t re-use passwords on different accounts
Or a hacker finding one of your passwords has them all!
Use a variable for each site you sign up to

Protecting Communications
Beware of “phishing” – malicious sites and emails that
try and fool you into revealing your log in details. Beware
of…
• Impersonal greetings e.g. “Dear Customer”
• Urgent calls to action (e.g. “Your account may have been
compromised, we urgently need to verify your details”)
• Panic-inducing notifications of actions taken in your name
e.g. purchases you didn’t make, sites you didn’t join
• Beware of “disguised links” in emails. Apparent links to
familiar sites like cnn.com could actually lead anywhere.
• Beware of linked sites unexpectedly asking you to log in.
