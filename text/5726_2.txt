Tracking down military people (thanks to Anthony Capaccio):
call the congressional/media query number at the National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis-- 314
801-0816. It's manned from 7am-5pm CST and reporters can leave message.
- The best way to request a record is to fax to 314-801-0763. Mark it ``Time Sensitive/Expedited Media''
request of the person's records. Ask for all information releasable under FOIA about the service record,
which will be compiled in a Form ``13164, Information Releasable Under the Freedom of Information
Act.''
Provide as much information as you can about the subject, such as military service, DOB, SSN, likely
years of service.
There is an email designated for congressional office inquiries that a reporter could use but the
preferred NARA method is fax. Here's the email: congressional.status@nara.gov
Also print out a copy of this useful Congressional Research Service report on military records:
