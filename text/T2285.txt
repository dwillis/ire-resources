We spent several months on a project that we tabbed, Unnatural Disasters, taking a term used by
Kofi Annan when describing horrific mudslide/debris flows in Venezuela. The goal was to make
the project as interactive as we could, while bringing together as many forms of media as were
available to us. That meant using the stories and photos that ran in the newspaper, putting them
online, running Web chats and blogs while even including clips from the local cable TV show, a
now-defunct partner of The Sun, in which our stories were told by a TV newscaster.

Below are a variety of site that can be relied upon before, and during, wildfires.
Mapping:
The National Interagency Fire Center details restricted airspace during fires, along with
restrictions for other reasons. Includes good maps along with monthly and seasonal predictions
for wildfire dangers.
http://airspace.nifc.gov/mapping/nifc/index.cfm
This site lists drought conditions, offers context and provides a list of contacts:
http://www.drought.unl.edu/dm/monitor.html
Provides a daily map displaying fire forecast:
http://www.fs.fed.us/land/wfas/fd_cls_f.gif
Great geospacial data and maps, not only for fires but a whole bunch of subjects:
http://www.geodata.gov/gos
The Remote Sensing Applications Center provides good maps, data and images:
http://activefiremaps.fs.fed.us/
Another mapping tool provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration:
http://www.firedetect.noaa.gov/viewer.htm
Local tools I use:
We are fortunate to have the mapping software company, ESRI, based in our backyard. The
private company has undertaken a number of projects working with local fire authorities, and
during wildfires, sends staff to keep updating maps.
www.esri.com
This offers a number of links, some of which are referenced here:

The San Bernardino Mountains are fortunate to have fire/police authorities willing to work
together. They came up with an organization called MAST that has been hailed by Gov.
Schwarzenegger's Blue Ribbon Fire Commission as a model to be replicated throughout
California:

Keep track of drought analysis, particularly as a fire season develops before the wildfires ignite.
http://www.drought.unl.edu/dm/monitor.html
This is an example of a site spawned by the 2003 fires that gave a wealth of information to
mountain residents who had to evacuate, and continues to do on mountain issues. Look for Web
sites, blogs and others for good info:

Tracks info as wildfires develop in California.

Resources:
These guys are a wealth of info, and helped us raise the question why mountain dwellers who
were calling for help weren't looking into a nonprofit group like the Fire Safe Council:
http://www.firesafecouncil.org/
The National Weather Service offers forecasts and predictions for the fire season outlook.
http://fire.boi.noaa.gov/
California Forestry and Fire Protection site with tons of information:
http://frap.cdf.ca.gov/
Expert list from University of California:

Innovative ideas on protecting homes from a U.S. Forest Service Fire Scientist:

The Government Accountability Office has studied wildfires for each of the past few years and
offered some pretty intriguing comments. Good background info:

Obviously, these are the guys who come in after the disaster:

Land/political resources:
Here are a couple of sites to track contributuins:

Floods:
Just a couple of examples of our county government providing ways to track how much water is
either falling on the ground or trickling down the river:

Imagery:
Offers good satellite photos:
http://www.fs.fed.us/r4/rsgis_fire/intro.html
Provides a daily photo of whatever is signifiant that day. Can make for a change of pace photo
during a series of wildfires.
