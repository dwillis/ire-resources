it Moving

Keep a whiteboard full of questions in plain sight, with
the bottom line in big letters: “Why Did 13 People Die?”

FOIAs: File as soon as you know you’re going to explore
this topic. (Consider using FOIA Machine. https
://www.foiamachine.org/)
Look for data that might be relevant. Consider what
requests you might have to make of government to get to
the answers to your questions, versus what’s on a given
website.
Assign someone to do screengrabs of all important
websites
Look for any and all academic research on the topic, no
matter how useless it might seem at first

Time Cheats for Reporters
•

•

•

•

Bag lunch twice a week; steal your “investigation
hours.” Mark them on your calendar as scheduled
time.
Start with the usual suspects: Inspector General
reports; audits; consultant studies; budget reports;
peruse trade magazines; enabling legislation; IRS
990 records.
Keep an organized memo of what you’re doing—
notes to self. Mark musings, theories, progress
made. Highlight dates. (The beginning of your
timeline.)
Write up interviews immediately, as camera ready

Editor’s Hat—
Managing the Investigation
•

Prioritize. Demand UNIQUE and REVELATORY. Does it
tell me something that I didn’t know?
If it’s a lengthy project, have a progress meeting. Can’t
be canceled. Can’t be longer than 30 minutes. Take
copious notes. Use the power of humiliation.
Involve key players early, even if you’re just
brainstorming: Graphics, photos, data specialists, news
researchers.
Read crucial documents behind reporters.
Be flexible but don’t bounce from idea to idea; the goal is
COMPLETION.
Editors should set aggressive but realistic deadlines for
reporters on when memos, drafts, stories, timeline info,

Getting It Seen
•

Do we have something that works perfectly for mobile?

•

Do we have something that works perfectly for print?

•

Do we have a social media plan?

•

•

How do we get our stories before a different audience?
(different sections of the print paper, but also pimping it to
audiences that might not read the Journal)
How do we know when people are most likely to read
this? How do we get that to them at that moment? (Don’t
publish the week between Christmas and New Year’s.)
