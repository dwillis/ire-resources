IRE Las Vegas Military Beat Handout, June 2010

Half the battle in reporting on the military is knowing the
players and building contact lists before a crisis because once
a crisis erupts in your circulation area it's very, very
difficult to get through to a military public affairs official,
much less a key direct participant.
Another rule -- the military is on different clock than
reporters -- I'm not just talking about its use of 24-hour time
-- i.e. 1300 hours for 1:00 o'clock. If you cover the military
get used to making calls in the 6:30 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. range.
Your chances of getting a military public affairs officer after
8:30 a.m. drop greatly after 9:00 a.m. They don't seem to return
calls or be available until after 5:30 p.m. -- always away at
meetings it seems.
To mitigate this problem, build up your e-mail contact list
early. If all you have is a name here are the current military
locator numbers for the Air Force (210-565-2660); Marine Corps
(1-703-784-3942); Navy (1-866-827-5672). The Army at this time
does not have a reliable locator number but a reporter could
call the Public Affairs for the Army Human Resources Command at
703-325-8856.
It also helps to get ranks accurate (see list)
Timely number -- if hostilities break out in Korea, the PA
number for U.S. Forces Korea is 011 82-2-7913 6029. Chief of
media is Dave Oten at david.oten@us.army.mil
One of the first things to do other than get acquainted
with your local military public affairs types is to get an
electronic subscription to the Pentagon's electronic clip
service called the Early Bird. It covers both print and
television transcript versions. Contact the Early Bird staff via
email at cns@dma.mil It's first good to send them any military
stories you have published to establish that you're on the beat.
The Bird will keep you informed of stories and pertinent
editorials that could give you contacts and ideas. The Navy
public affairs staff, unlike the Army or Air Force, publishes
its own compilation of daily clips you might be able to get
electronically. Call Navy PA in the Pentagon at 703-697-5342.

First Week Tips
Here are two other first week tips: 1) Order a copy of
``Pen & Sword -- A Journalist's Guide to Covering the
Military.'' By Ed Offley. Marion Street Press. 503-888-4624.
www.marionstreetpress.com
2) The best and fastest way to learn about the overall
military-industrial complex presence in your state -- a good
first day or first week on beat chore -- is to check the
Pentagon's Atlas/Data Abstract for the United States and
Selected Areas at http://siadapp.dmdc.osd.mil/ Click on
``Personnel'' then ``Publications for the Atlas. Fiscal 2008 is
the latest available. I have included a ``summary'' page and
``Nevada'' page (since we are in that state)
- http://siadapp.dmdc.osd.mil/personnel/L03/fy08/atlas_2008.pdf
-- http://siadapp.dmdc.osd.mil/personnel/L03/fy08/atlas-2008summary.pdf
http://siadapp.dmdc.osd.mil/personnel/L03/fy08/atlas_2008.pdf Neveda
You can check the number of state or regional people
killed in the war on terrorism at
http://siadapp.dmdc.osd.mil/personnel/casualty.
Bookmark the site because it's highly useful on deadline
and often hard to find. I have included the May 29 listing.
3) To get up to speed on current weapons programs you need
to know the major contractors in your state. Start with the
listing at USAspending.gov and run a state profile. Click On
``Summaries'' FY 2009 to see macro view of defense spending. You
can also sort by agency and ``congressional'' districts to track
spending. (enclosed in handout)
You can track the cost of major weapons by checking the
quarterly Selected Acquisition Reports, or SARS, published four
times a year: http://www.acq.osd.mil/ara/am/sar. Enclosed is one
useful page of the current quarterly compilation that includes
how much Congress has approved to date and total cost in
inflation-adjusted dollars.
For example, the joint Army-Marine Corps Mrap fortified
vehicle program for Iraq and Afghanistan is estimated to cost
$36.2 billion, with $26.3 billion already approved by Congress.
The U.S. Government Accountability Offices annual weapons

reports is also a crucial resource:

Contractor Deaths
One of the largely uncovered legacies of the Iraq and
Afghanistan wars is contractor deaths and injuries -- 1,471 in
Iraq and 338 in Afghanistan through March 30.
Under a World War II-era law called the Defense Base Act,
contractors are required to carry death and injury insurance.
The government reimburses companies for the premiums. In
many cases, if the injury or death is war-related, insurers also
will be reimbursed as well for the full cost of benefits, plus
15 percent in administrative fees.
I have written stories about contractors, such as KBR,
alleged to have submitted inflated premiums for reimbursement
and alleged excessive profits by insurance carriers such as AIG.
ProPublica has written extensively about the plight of
workers denied benefits by major insurance carriers and
contractors failing to report injuries and death in a timely
manner.
You can track these issues in your circulation area by
looking at the Department of Labor Office of Workman
Compensation Office website.
It lists companies, and totals of injuries and deaths
http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc/lsdbareports.htm
ProPublica's series gives names of attorneys specializing in
DBA claims.

Phone Lists
Knowing the players in your region is like covering the
fire department before a four-alarm fire. Make face to face
contact, gather e-mails, cell phone numbers, wire diagram charts
and directories of bases beforehand.
If your base has a unit deployed overseas, find out who
heads any associations charged with family support. They can be
valuable in an emergency.
Your reporting will also inevitably involve calling ``The
Pentagon.''
Enclosed are the latest telephone listings
of public affairs officers for the Office of Secretary of
Defense.

phone numbers.
Social Media
The Pentagon in February reversed a directive
that had blocked access from U.S. military computers to about 10
social-networking sites, such as YouTube and MySpace.
Troops will have unrestricted access to these and other
sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, if security precautions are
applied and ethical guidelines are followed. That could be a
real benefit for reporters who follow military leaders like JCS
Chairman Mike Mullen on Twitter or NATO Commander Admiral James
Stravridis on Facebook
I arranged a DC interview with Stavridis
via Facebook, for example.
Mullen's office has issued a `Follow The Chairman' card
that lists all his social network accounts such as
www.twitter.com/thejointstaff
Here's the Pentagon's social media link listing all official
users:
http://www.defense.gov/RegisteredSites/SocialMediaSites.aspx
Enforcers
Among the other key players to check for in your area are
field officers for the Defense Criminal Investigative Service -the Pentagon's FBI at http://www.dodig.mil/inv/dcis/dcismap2.htm
The Army Audit Agency, Navy Audit Agency, Air Force audit
agency and the criminal investigative branches of each service
have offices near military installations. Get to known
investigators in your area.
The Navy Audit Service, unlike the Army and Air Force audit
agencies, has a very transparent web site that lists reports.
The Army and Air Force don't list report titles, making you FOIA
for titles or waiting until the prior six months are published
by the Pentagon Inspector General in its semi-annual report.
That's why meeting and cultivating regionally based
auditors is key to finding out in a timely manner what reports
are available.
Here's the DoD IG Master list of its publications contained on
its website:
DOD IG Master list: http://www.dodig.mil/PUBS/index.html
Service audits listed in IG semi-annual are located at:

The Special Inspector General For Iraq Reconstruction Stuart
Bowen puts on a quarterly report that most usefully contains the
ongoing work of other agencies on Iraq fraud, waste and abuse,
including the GAO, Pentagon IG and Army Audit Agency:
http://www.sigir.mil/files/quarterlyreports/April2010/Report_April_2010.pdf#view=fit
The Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction
Arnold Fields also publishes a quarterly report at
http://www.sigar.mil/pdf/quarterlyreports/Apr2010/SIGARapril_Lor
es.pdf. Check the section ``Other Agency Oversight'' to track
ongoing State, AID, Defense and GAO reports as the U.S. military
commitment there grows.
If your area is heavy with defense contractors see if the
Defense Contract Management Agency, or DCMA, has a field office
or representative in a major defense facility at DCMA.mil. DCMA
now has a FOIA reading room where it has posted monthly reports
it's released on the F-35 fighter program at
http://www.dcma.mil/dcmahq/FOIA/reading_room.cfm
Also check if there is a regional field office of the U.S.
Government Accountability Office in your region. GAO auditors
are good source of context on defense management and weapons
programs and can give insights into ongoing work and reports
near completion. They are also free to talk about reports they
have already released.

Obtaining Military Records/Fakes
Covering the military more and more involves uncovering

instances of `fake valor,'' or an exaggerated military record.
Here's a listing of good stories to review for technique and
context: 1) Washington Post, May 10, 2010: Exposing Falsified
Valor, Christian Davenport. 2) Financial Times: Mock Heroics,
Oct. 24, 2004, Jonathan Green. 3) New York Times, A Sworn
Mission to Unmask Pretenders to Military. Pam Belluck, Aug. 10,
2001. 4) The Story Behind A Soldier's Story (The Ed Daily, No
Gun Ri charade), May 31, 2001, Michael Moss.
Here's how to get the official breakdown of person's military
record from the National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis
http://www.archives.gov/st-louis/military-personnel.
Fax on company letter to its ``emergency line'' -- 314-8010763. Write `Attention: Customer Service, Media Request.''
Include a return Fax number and mail address.
Outline who you are, provide deadline and ask for ``all
information under FOIA'' on the person. At minimum you need
name, middle initial, date and place of birth and branch of
service.''
The center within 3 days will work to compile a Form 13164
that lists military record and medals, if any.

Analysts
There are three very good watchdog/analysis groups: The
Center For Strategic and Budgetary Assessment, Project on
Government Oversight, or POGO and Taxpayers For Common Sense.
CSBA is the best D.C. think tank in terms of explaining the
defense budget, which now consumes about 20.6 cents per dollar
of discretionary federal government spending. It published
a ``Strategy For The Long Haul'' outlining major defense
issues faced by the Obama administration, including the
center's idea of a comprehensive defense strategy.
The strategy is a valuable starting point if you are thrust
into a defense politics story and don't have a lot of sources in
the area. Csbaonline.org is the URL.
The POGO ferrets government waste and abuse. Pogo.org.
It maintains a data base on corporate fraud, waste and abuse
convictions, guilty pleas and civil fines.
Laura Peterson, the national security analyst for
Taxpayers' is expert on tracking congressional defense earmarks.
