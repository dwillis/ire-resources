Badger Outdoors: A major
source of crime guns
z Based in West Milwaukee, Badger

Outdoors/Badger Guns have been the source
of the majority of crime guns recovered by
Milwaukee police in the past decade.
z The operation accounted for about one-third
of all crime guns traced by Milwaukee police
in a four-year period. (2006-2009)
z Badger Outdoors had been the top seller of
crime guns not just in Milwaukee, but also the
nation in 2005 with 537 such guns.

Reporter gets a tip
In 2007, Journal
Sentinel reporter John
Diedrich learned that
Badger Outdoors’
federal firearm license
was in jeopardy.
z Around the same time,
the store changed
ownership and its
name to Badger Guns.
z

First FOIA redacted
Diedrich requested all license inspection records
for Badger Outdoors/Badger Guns from the ATF in
September 2007
z He received heavily redacted documents, with no
mention of revocation.
z

Badger sells crime guns
z In a 2-year period

from 2007 to 2009,
six Milwaukee police
officers were
seriously wounded by
guns purchased at
Badger Guns or
Badger Outdoors,
located in West
Milwaukee.

Crackdown by Milwaukee
Police
After the shootings,
Milwaukee police
conducted an undercover
operation in fall 2009 that
found felons visiting the
store and even using the
shooting range for
practice.
z They also made dozens
of arrests for “straw
buying.”

Second FOIA reveals
revocation
z Diedrich resubmitted a FOIA in June 2009.
z This time around, the ATF neglected to

redact a key line about a recommendation
for revocation on the same documents sent
earlier.

Non-redacted report

“Wiped Clean” series begins
z The un-redacted document allowed Diedrich

to report in January 2010 that Badger
Outdoors had been recommended for
revocation in 2006 but had managed to stay
in business.
z How was this possible?

A “clean slate”
z

z

z

The previous license holder Mick
Beatovic said he was retiring
and relinquished his license in
2007, though he still owns the
building and is the landlord,
receiving rent payments from the
business.
Adam Allan, the 28-year-old son
of one of the owners of Badger
Outdoor, took out a new license.
These moves not only halted the
revocation process but also
erased violations found by
federal regulators over 17 years
at Badger Outdoors

A “clean slate”
Badger Outdoors had been
recommended for
revocation in November
2006, but Adam Allan didn’t
become the license holder
until September 2007.
z The ATF told us they didn’t
keep track how often gun
stores remain open after a
license recommended for
revocation is relinquished
and a new license is issued.

Reaction from the DA
z

z

Milwaukee County District Attorney John
Chisholm said he first learned of the violations
and the recommended revocation of Badger
Outdoors from the Journal Sentinel.
"From a common-sense assessment of what is
going on here, of course this wasn't sold,"
Chisholm said. "These guys are cagey,
sophisticated dealers and they have legally
thwarted every attempt ATF has made to
regulate their conduct. . . . They have a builtin escape clause. What other industry gets that
kind of sweetheart deal?"

John Chisholm

Limits of the law
z The ATF is only allowed to inspect a gun

store once a year without evidence of a crime
z Besides revocation, the ATF cannot suspend
or issue fines, except in rare instances.
z Revocation of a gun dealer can take years –
dealers appeal directly into federal court.
z Meanwhile, they can continue to sell guns.

Badger’s uncertain future
Badger is facing two civil lawsuits filed by four
wounded Milwaukee police officers.
z Also, Badger’s firearms license expired in fall 2010,
thought it’s now operating under a temporary
authorization from the ATF.
z ATF investigators finished a compliance inspection
of Badger Guns earlier in 2010, but the inspection
remains open.
z An undercover Milwaukee police operation
continues to stop felons leaving Badger Guns.

No gun-selling license? No
problem

Last June, we reported on
another Wisconsin store –
Shawano Gun & Loan – near
Green Bay.
The ATF revoked the store’s
license in 2007 after repeatedly
warning the store about missing
records and brazen straw-buying
violations. Nearly four years
later, the case is still tied up in
federal court in Green Bay.

Shawano Gun and Pawn
z The store has sold thousands of guns each

year with the ATF's blessing.
z Just lost in the Court of Appeals, clearing
the way for ATF to revoke them.
z The owner told ATF investigators he may
transfer the license to his nephew, which
would give the store a clean slate.
(he hasn’t done that yet)

Shooting range loophole
z

z

z

z

Gun stores must check the
criminal background of anyone
buying a gun.
But no check is required for a
gun rented for the store's
shooting range. A background
check is not even allowed for
rentals, the newspaper found
Gun stores don't have to check
a renter's ID, fill out paperwork
or even write down a name.
Store owners say doing a
background check on renters
would be time consuming and
too costly.

in Waukesha, says there’s only so
much owners can do to keep felons
from using store gun ranges. Photo by

“Ineffective rules let gun stores
endure”
z These local examples prompted us to take a

national view of the issue.
z First, we needed data.
The key data sets we obtained:
z ATF’s adverse action database (took months)
z Database of revoked gun dealers
z The current database of all active gun
dealers

Adverse action database
Data set we used included all dealers that ATF
opened a revocation case or denial of license
renewal from fiscal years 2005 to 2010.
z From that data, we used Excel to figure out that the
agency took an average of 15 months to process a
recommendation to revoke or deny renewal of a
firearms license.
z Dozens of cases took three years or more to
resolve.
z ATF succeeded in revoking about half the time.
z

Revoked, but still open
z We also wanted to find out how many gun

dealers who had been revoked or denied
renewal remained in operation under a
different license or name.
z We used Microsoft Access to match a list of
601 revoked firearm dealers with a current list
of roughly 62,000 active retail dealers for
similar names, addresses and ZIP codes.
z Comparing those lists produced more than
150 possible matches.

Database work finds matches
z We then called all 150 active gun dealers we

identified as having a possible connection to
a revoked license holder.
z It’s amazing what people will admit to you.
z In total, we found connections between 52
current gun dealers and revoked dealers.
z In another 34 cases, we found an indication
of a connection but not a complete
corroboration.

“Phoenix rising”
Dozens of revoked dealers
freely admitted to us their
license was revoked and a
new one was acquired by
someone close to the
former license holder.
z "We call it the phoenix
rising from the ashes," said
Teresa Ficaretta, ATF's
deputy assistant director
for enforcement programs
and services.

A few examples
z
z

z

z

Popguns - Indianapolis
A top dealer of crime guns according to the ATF, Popguns had
its license revoked by the agency in 2006 for poor recordkeeping and they appealed the decision for 1 year+.
Still, the business is still open after owner Mike Hilton's wife got a
new license and the violations disappeared. Mike Hilton works
there full time to assist the manager. His wife stops in once a
week.
“The fact that I can be in here and work in the store other than in a
clerk capacity, it is kind of asinine, I agree,” Hilton told us. “You
revoke a license but then the person whose license is revoked, they
can come right back in and can be an integral part of it.”

A few examples
Northeast Firearms Inc. - Honesdale, Pa.
Mike Jones Jr., the owner of Northeast Firearms, said he was
forced to surrender his previous firearm license at the same
location because of five "petty" violations and one serious
violation, which he said was based on "hearsay." He declined to
be more specific.
Jones was the license holder at the previous store, called Northeast
Firearms of Main St. Inc., until the ATF revoked the license in
2009.
After spending $30,000 on attorney fees to appeal the revocation,
Jones said he agreed to surrender the license for nine months
and was back in business as of last spring.
"Yes, me personally, I got the new license," Jones said. "There is no
beating them. It's like the IRS - there's no winning."
z

A few examples
Farnsworth Firearms - Vonore, Tenn.
The license at Robert Farnsworth's gun shop was denied renewal in
2005. A store by the same name is operating in the same
location. An employee at the store said Farnsworth was still in
charge.
"Robert's the man," the employee said.
However, when Farnsworth got on the phone, he denied running the
store. He said he sold it and didn't have anything do with it.
Asked why he was in the store, he said: "I'm in here trying to buy a
gun today."
A reporter told Farnsworth one of the employees said he was in
charge. Farnsworth laughed. "He's just messing with you, giving
you a hard time."
Because Farnsworth did not admit his involvement, the we counted
him among the 34 with indications of a connection.

ATF: Our hands are tied
z

z

z

Congress in general only allows ATF to issue a warning or
revoke; it has very narrow suspension or fining authority.
Congress has even told ATF it cannot require stores to take an
inventory.
If ATF can prove the corporation was created just to circumvent
the law, ATF can deny the license. To get that information,
however, the ATF has to get business records. But the agency
has no right to compel applicants to produce many business
documents, in contrast with other licenses such as alcohol
wholesalers.
"It is very difficult for us to get the evidence we need to deny an
application," ATF’s Teresa Ficaretta said. "We ask for
documentation, particularly in these hidden ownership cases, but
more and more frequently we are finding that applicants are
telling us to go pound sand."
