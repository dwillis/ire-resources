Crime maps are very popular among readers. Look at the abundance of regularly
updated crime maps on the Web published by newspapers, other media
organizations and police departments. For a sampling, see list compiled by Danny
Sanchez at:

The popularity of crime maps is an outgrowth of more law-enforcement agencies
turning to crime maps to fight crime. Police fell in love with mapping after
William Bratton claimed that a management tool called CompStat (“computer
statistics”) helped him to reduce crime as New York’s police chief in the 1990s.

•

As a result, many police departments quickly collect summary information about
crime reports, including addresses, in a format they can map. Reporters need to
get those reports daily in electronic format.

•

Many story possibilities using crime maps: Where’s the most violent crime?
Where are the highest concentrations of robberies? Rapes? What kind of crimes
occurs around schools? One of the most popular mapping stories of recent years
has been about where sexual offenders live. Here’s an example:

Always put crime in context – i.e., in a rate, dividing number of crimes by
residents in area or land mass. Better yet, use hotspot analysis, using CrimeStat,
available for free at http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/CRIMESTAT/

•

ArcView is the preferred software for mapping. But it’s not cheap and takes time
to learn. There are online programs that allow you to map incidents without much
training. See maps.google.com, batchgeocode.com, and geocommons.com

Story for the times: The economic recession and crime. Crime rates are going up
in some areas, particularly for property crime. Look at burglary hotspots. Look at
foreclosure concentrations and crime. See the Charlotte Observer story at:
