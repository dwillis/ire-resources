Giving readers a thread
to follow
In a fast-moving story, you can use

– building an audience, and co-opting
new people to help.

Readers could follow the thread in real time,
while we finished the next story.

Showing your work

I asked, to show readers what's missing. This also invites them to fill in the blanks.
