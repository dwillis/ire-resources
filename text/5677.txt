Why Build Trust?

Credibility is all we have
• Gallup has been asking about media trust since 1972 and found it hit a high-water mark in 1976, three
years after the Watergate scandal.
• That year, 72% of Americans said they had “a great deal” or “a fair amount” of “trust in the mass media.”
• With the advent of cable news and the rise of talk radio in the 1980s, that number began to fall to the low
and mid 50s by the 1990s, and remained there for roughly a decade.
• It has fallen slowly but fairly consistently since the early 2000s, dropping below 50% in 2007.
• In September 2016, it hit a new low of 32%. Among Republicans, it was just 14%.
What do people think of the news?
• More Americans have a negative view (43%) than a positive (33%) view of the news media, while 23% are
neutral.
• Poynter Media Trust survey from 2017 showed half of America thinks we’re making it up
• Knight Foundation/Gallup survey from 2018 showed Republicans most often name Fox News as an
objective news source, while Democrats are more varied.
• That same survey found NPR is the most often mentioned objective news source among postgraduates
(19%)
What’s a journalist to do?
• Accept that earning trust is part of the job
• Just doing good journalism is NOT enough
• Get an understanding of what the audience thinks of you
• Educate the audience about our news gathering process
How to respond to criticism
• Bring focus to your reporting
• Offer to explain how you get your information
• Ask for feedback
• Remind the viewer that this is your community too
• Share something you have in common
• Explain your goal is to hold people accountable
• Help them understand your correction policy
• Be polite and respectful, but defend your work

Building Trust One Viewer at a Time!
I don’t have time for this call
• Don’t rush a tipster or viewer who calls you
• Agree to call them back if needed, and do it
• Be willing to meet them without a camera
• Check in with them weekly
• Be honest about your timeline
• Send them past stories they can relate to
• For those difficult interviews, go old school, write a letter
Sharing Their Story
• Be open about where the story might go
• Alert them to possible risks
• Let them know they’re making a difference
• Help them protect themselves
Before the Interview
• Be flexible with interview location
• Be honest about tough questions
• Visually prepare them for the interview
• Always have a producer monitor
• Discuss how you’ll refer to them
• Keep them updated on what you’re doing before air
High Threshold for Not Showing Your Face
• Explain your newsroom’s policy
• Your life is in jeopardy
• Your current job is in jeopardy
• Sexual Assault or abuse victim
• But there are exceptions
Process Language
• Tell viewers where the story came from
• Make it easy to contact the team with tip line, bylines on articles
• Show viewers how you’re creating change with POP
• Consider doing a “Results Week”
You’re Not Done After the Story Airs
• Follow up with original tipster
• They will come back to you
• Respond to viewers who call or email, even if you don’t think it will lead anywhere
• Follow through on story with updates
• Be polite, but tough on social media

Fighting “Fake News” with Facts
Check & Repeat
• Don’t believe anyone—check out everyone and everything
• Data data data—video and examples make it compelling, data makes it bullet proof
• Prepare for interviews—many PR reps are recording everything you do and say, be prepared!
Find the right words
• Be direct - don’t be too cute - don’t over-do “exclusive”, “you won’t believe”
• Remember the lawyer’s creed: “ Write what you know--not what you think you know”
• ACCURACY—ATTRIBUTION—ACCOUNTABILITY
Prepare for “Fake News” attack
• Anticipate the questions, have a response ready
• Show your work: post the data, entire interviews, information requests, show viewers you have nothing
to hide
• Tell them the who, what, why, where and how of your reporting
Fill in the blanks
• Respond! Respond! Respond! To viewers/readers/users
• Follow up with sources, subjects of stories, stakeholders
• Follow up with more stories if you can
