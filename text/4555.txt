IRE 2015, Philadelphia, June 4-7

Who is John Doe?
Backgrounding an individual in a hurry
Someone is suddenly swept into a news event: a train crash, a natural disaster, a police shooting.
Who is s/he? What’s their story? Find out what websites and other resources you should use to
quickly unveil this person's past and present -- whether you have only 15 minutes, an hour, a day
or the luxury of a week. Find undiscovered social-media accounts and court records, and learn
new search-engine tricks, all on the cheap.

Speakers:
Kate Martin, The News Tribune, Tacoma, Wash. @KateReports; kate.martin@newstribune.com

Facebook intel: http://graph.tips/: Performs graph search functions from a clean interface.
Search for the FB account by trying a valid email address. This works best if you are signed in
with an account who is friends within the target’s social circle.
Twitter tricks:
 Search interface: https://twitter.com/search-advanced
 Search tweets with one more word to find people at the scene: Add “me” or “my” to the
search string
What to do if you only have an email address?
 Pipl.com. Take results with a grain of salt. Example
 Username search across many popular websites: http://knowem.com/
If you only have a phone number:
 Listen to the target’s outgoing voicemail message (without their phone ringing):
http://www.spydialer.com
 http://www.phonelookup.com/: Sometimes gives a name. Worth trying
Who owns that website? https://www.whois.net/ — can lead to email/home address and phone
numbers, but usually masked or sometimes has old info. Worth trying as a tool that occasionally
pays off.

 Little Sis: http://littlesis.org/
 Don’t forget state level political giving.
