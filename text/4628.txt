* Completeness: Does it include all the projects?
* Timeliness: Are all years included? Why aren’t
last year projects listed?
* Accuracy: the projects described are real?
Regions correspond to real regions? Values are
real for each project?
* Integrity: does it reflect the original data for all
projects? Are there duplicated projects or
countries?
* Validity: Numeric are all digits? Dates have valid
months, years? Formats are assigned? Negative
values in project cost?
* Consistency: inicial and deactivation date
overlap? A country is classified in the wrong
region? Instrument type didn’t exist when project
was approved?
