Every 3 months, contractors, nonprofits, local governments, etc. are required to report about 100
different pieces of information, detailing how much stimulus money they received, what they did
with it and how many jobs they created. But it’s also useful for investigations beyond the
stimulus because it includes useful data on subcontractors, the 5 highest paid employees and
detailed vendor expenses for school district and other grants.
ProPublica’s Guide to Recovery.gov: http://www.propublica.org/ion/stimulus/item/propublicasfaq-for-recovery.gov-1109
ProPublica’s Recovery Tracker: http://projects.propublica.org/recovery
ProPublica made the data searchable by county and added in thousands of records from
USASpending – including small business loans, Pell grants and Section 8 allocations. We also
added in Cash for Clunkers data and linked sub-recipients like school districts to their counties.
Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS): https://www.fpds.gov/
The federal government has an Excel spreadsheet of federal stimulus contracts that’s more up to
data than Recovery.gov. You can search by city or county and find out if the company is
minority-owned. However, the database includes only federal projects and doesn’t contain things
like road projects that are contracted at the state level. You can follow bids solicitations as they
come out on www.fedbizopps.gov.
USASpending.gov: http://www.usaspending.gov/
This is another place to download information on contracts, grants and loans. Click on spending,
then contracts/grants/loans and advanced search for place of performance. You can click on level
of detail you want or download it in a txt file which you can open in Excel.
Excluded Parties List System: https://www.epls.gov/
This unwieldy database contains contractors and other groups that have been prohibited from
receiving federal money for one reason or another. This is a good way to find stimulus
contractors with problems in their past. To download it, click on advanced search, scroll to the
bottom and click search. Scroll to the bottom again and you’ll see links to download the data in
ASCII, Excel or XML. States, cities and schools districts also keep their own debarred lists.

Obtain detailed reports on the financial shape of nonprofits, health centers and other federal
grantees. The Sunlight Foundation had a story comparing this database to stimulus recipients:

BEYOND RECOVERY.GOV
Nearly every federal agency is collecting additional information from stimulus recipients.
Transportation projects
Highways: http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/economicrecovery/weeklylists.htm
Airports: http://www.faa.gov/airports/aip/grantapportion_data/media/fy09_cumulative_approved
_arra_grants.xls
Transit: http://www.fta.dot.gov/documents/FTA_ARRA_Awards.xls
These databases are more up to date and have additional info like county and project type. AP,
USA Today, the Journal Sentinel and ProPublica have compared these databases to other
databases to show that the money wasn’t going to the most critical bridges, roads or airports.
In addition, each month, state DOTs are required to file “recipient project status reports” and
“summary employment forms” that list contractors, DBE info and jobs. They used to be called
forms 1585 and 1587 but now the state DOTs upload the data into FHWA’s RADS system.
GAO Reports
If you live in Arizona, California, Colorado, DC, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, the
GAO does a 50 page bimonthly report on how your state is using stimulus money.

Cash for Clunkers: http://www.cars.gov/carsreport
Several databases of transactions in the government program to trade in gas guzzlers for more
fuel efficient vehicles, including type of vehicles, mileage, dealer, price, VIN, junkyard, etc.
NIH Grants
State search: http://report.nih.gov/recovery/arragrants.cfm
Keyword search: http://projectreporter.nih.gov/reporter.cfm
This database gives you additional information about the research and the principal investigator.
SBA Loans
New America Media obtained a database of ARC loans that contained additional information,
such as bank, race, gender, and veteran status of the owner.

Weatherization
Starting this month, states will have to report monthly and quarterly to the Energy Department on
the number of units weatherized, fuel type and demographic information about the household.
Education
By September 2011, states will have to report 37 pieces of information, including a list of their
lowest-performing schools, details of how they evaluate teacher performance and the number of
teachers rated at each performance level.
