Go beyond the numbers
 As reporters, we’re used to using data for adding,
subtracting, percentage-ing & predicting.

 Many databases are perfect for finding other
details for your stories – without making a single
calculation.
 You can find addresses, phone numbers,
birthdates, property ownership, familial and
personal relationships.

Voter registration
The phone book of the newsroom
 Request your county’s voter registration rolls.
 Most likely will come as a CSV or text file.

 You can (usually!) get
 Name
 Address
 Gender
 Birthdate
 Phone number
 Party affiliation
 Voting history

You can get…
 Full name and address

You can get…
 Birth date, birth place, phone number, gender

You can get…
 Voting history

Use it in your newsroom
 It’s a quick lookup for phone numbers, contact
information
 Use it to double-check that you’ve got the right
person.
 Make lists of birthdates for key players in your
stories – never list a wrong age again.
 Feed your PANDA – upload the data and share
with colleagues
 This option is great for the less data-inclined; no SQL
search needed.

But be careful…
 Some information might be inaccurate or old
 Voting histories have been especially inaccurate.
 Try to request updated data each year.

 Your county or state might have stricter laws on what
information can be released.
 Example: San Diego County has put up a fight in releasing
phone numbers.

 If someone’s not a registered voter, he/she won’t be there.
 If someone’s registered in another county, he/she won’t be
there.
 Large file size
 Try linking to data in Access.

Workarounds worth mentioning
 Some counties have their voter databases
available online, either as a searchable portal or
login site.
 It’s good when you only need to find one person’s
contact info.
 It’s bad when you don’t have all necessary info (like
birth date)
 Try using a people finder, or backgrounding tool like
Accurint, to help.
 Also, simply try calling the registrar of voters, if
you’re just trying to find someone’s contact info.
 There’s nothing stopping a friendly clerk from looking up
someone’s info.

Clark County, Nevada
An example of an online voter lookup.

Campaign finance data
Not just for following the money!
 You can use state, county and city campaign
finance data to determine relationships, people’s
employment, a second address, etc.
 Some finance data will not include addresses –
this depends on your local laws.
 The info is obviously limited to those who donate
to elections.
 Some places are still in the stone ages and filing
on paper.

An example

Pet license data
 Request pet license data from
your county’s animal control
department.
 Besides pet names, it most likely
will have the owner’s address,
and sometimes phone number.
 This data is often updated –
people don’t want to lose their
pets!

 Again, limited only to people
who have pets.

Property records
 Property records can also show relationships
between people, offer contact information and
more.
 Check to see if your county’s register of deeds
has an online data lookup.
 Put your subject’s name in, and see what comes
up – who is he/she selling to? Where does he/she
live?
 Caution: just because a person owns a property
doesn’t mean he lives there.

Happy hunting!
