SHORTHAND GUIDE TO
OPENSECRETS.ORG
Four ways to access:
APIs: http://www.opensecrets.org/resources/create/apis.php
Open Data: http://www.opensecrets.org/resources/create/data.php
(You need to create an account to access these, but they're both free,
although subject to some use restrictions).

The website, generally, has a lot of places you can see data in various
forms of improvement.
Finally, call us. Some work that might be a lot of work for you is easy for
us, and doing work for reporters is part of our mission.

The FEC: See Chris Schnaars' guide for a way you can DIY this, if for
some reason you'd want to. Another good resource is Paul Clark, who
works in their data office.
The FEC receives data from filers and the Senate and House, but before
that data lands in their bulk data file, they go through an auditing process.
This means that their bulk files are often delayed. You can collect the
electronic data provided by filers, but this excludes all Senate filers and
you'll need to clean up a lot of the junk in these files yourself.
The Senate: XML files, updated daily, of electronically­filed lobbying
data.
The House: We use this to establish some links you can't see otherwise in
the data.
The IRS: We collect both 527s data and "manifest" data related to
nonprofits.
990 data can also be collected manually ­­ the IRS is often slower to
respond to requests than the organizations themselves, who are required by
law to provide you with their public documents, including their application
materials when they're applying to be nonprofits.
Sometimes these groups can be squirrely.

Website Links
Donor lookup: Allow you to see individual contributions to candidates,
PACs, 527s, etc. Searches the FEC­quality data, not CRP's data, so you
need to look for all combinations of a donor's name.
