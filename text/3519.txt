Investigating Nonprofits

There are more than 1.5 million nonprofits currently operating in the United States. Each year, roughly
98 percent of applicants for tax‐exempt status are approved by the IRS. At the state level, regulators
charged with oversight are generally understaffed to handle the task at hand.
Keeping all that in mind, here are some ways to structure your investigation of a nonprofit.
Anything Goes: Approval of Nonprofit Status by the IRS
A sobering assessment of the current lay of the land. This report, by Rob Reich, Lacey Dorn and Stefanie
Sutton of Stanford University’s Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society, notes that oversight of
applications for tax exemptions by charities is so weak it borders on "nonexistent."

Obtaining 990s and exemption applications
Ah, the 990. It can be maddening, yet it’s a treasure trove of potentially useful nuggets. Nonprofits are
required to give you their last three years’ 990s ‐‐ no ifs, ands, or buts. They’re also required to provide a
copy of their application for tax‐exempt status (Form 1024), as well as supporting documents.
Should a nonprofit stonewall you (hey, it happens), or simply to backstop what you’re receiving from
them, a useful tool to have in your arsenal is IRS Form 4506‐A, which allows you to request a copy of the
exemption application directly from the IRS. The first 100 pages are free to the media, 20 cents per page
after that.
For an excellent overview on deciphering the IRS 990, turn to IRE Tipsheet #3496, by the Orange County
Register’s Ronald Campbell.
State information
The IRS 990 is but one glimpse into how a nonprofit conducts its affairs. The information provided at the
state level can, and sometimes does, deviate from what’s provided to Uncle Sam. State‐filed information
can provide a great counterbalance to the information you’re seeing in the 990.
Most states (nearly 40 right now) require charities to register with an agency (usually the Attorney
General or Secretary of State) if they intend to do fundraising. As with all public records, states vary
widely in both the quality and quantity of information made available. Multiple agencies may have a
hand in the regulatory process, so make sure you check with every agency that keeps a paper trail.

For starters, look for registration documents, and contracts between the nonprofit and professional
fundraisers. Other things to look for: independent audits, lobbying activity, consumer complaints on file
and any correspondence between the agency and charity or fundraiser.
Look at how the nonprofit conducts its affairs in other states, too.
A note about independent audits: some states require an audit when reported revenue on the 990
reaches a tipping point; say, $100,000. So be on the alert for a nonprofit that routinely falls just short of
that figure.
Taken together, state filings can provide a glimpse behind the curtain into a nonprofit’s daily affairs, and
possibly a very different view that what you’ll get with the 990.
The IRS website provides a gateway to state websites that pertain to nonprofit oversight. So does
