Health Care on the Beat: Investigating Doctors and Drugs
Investigative Reporters and Editors, June 11, 2010

The doctors
First, investigate doctors as you would any person and business. Check all court, corporate and
educational records. My favorite, less-used investigative records are the real estate filings in
county recorders’ offices. Find them mostly on-line. I’ve made an overview of web-based
backgrounding at “Who is John Doe – and where to get the paper on him” at
http://www.reporter.org/desktop/tips/johndoe.htm Any connections with government should be
explored through state or federal FOIA. http://www.rcfp.org/foialetter/index.php. And obviously
you would check state medical boards, http://www.fsmb.org/directory_smb.html.
Many good stories focus on doctors’ conflicts of interest, particularly professors and key opinion
leaders. Some drug companies are disclosing their recent payments, either as required by federal
prosecutors or in preparation for the Physician Payments Sunshine Act (2012 payments to be
posted Sept. 30, 2013). But company postings are difficult to compile
(http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/13/business/13docpay.html). So start with a new Web site,
PharmaShine, offering free individual name look-up of specific payments to doctors from
compiled drug and device company disclosures: http://www.pharmashine.com. Years of more
general disclosures can also be found in journal articles – follow the trail from PubMed’s 19
million citations, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/ -- and in disclosures required at many
universities, medical conferences, guideline-writing bodies and continuing medical education
classes. Medscape is the largest CME Web site, http://cme.medscape.com/medscapetoday.
I am not experienced yet in the new IRS-990 tax filings from nonprofit organizations, but they’re
certain to be valuable for us in covering some medical practices, hospitals and advocacy groups.

And here’s an investigator who scares KOL’s, helps some reporters, and keeps files on the
influence of money on medicine: Paul Thacker, Sen. Charles Grassley, paul_thacker@financerep.senate.gov, 202-224-6956.
The drugs
Your drug-related stories will benefit from the wealth of blogs and news aggregators tracking the
industry. My own must-read site is Ed Silverman’s at PharmaLot http://www.pharmalot.com/. He
has a comprehensive Blog Roll listing other blogs. Other favorites: Café Pharma (employee
boards) at http://www.cafepharma.com/, the Wall Street Journal Health Blog at
http://blogs.wsj.com/health/, BNET http://industry.bnet.com/pharma, and the Pharma Marketing
Blog at http://pharmamkting.blogspot.com/.

Then there are the do-gooders. Pharmed Out (http://pharmedout.org/), the Pew Prescription
Project (http://www.prescriptionproject.org/) and Public Citizen
(http://www.citizen.org/Page.aspx?pid=524 and http://www.worstpills.org/). And for a probusiness view, check Tom Sullivan’s Policy and Medicine blog (http://www.policymed.com/).
As for documents, you’ll start in court discovery and depositions, and look for help in the
plaintiffs’ bar. Many major personal-injury lawsuits against drug makers have consolidated
discoveries. And the lawyers (with obvious self-interest) may point journalists to documents
attached to motions. I filed an affidavit last year that helped persuade a judge to unseal
ghostwriting documents related to Wyeth hormone replacement products. There may be other
opportunities to make the public interest and newsgathering argument in court. The University of
California – San Francisco keeps a Drug Industry Document Archive of previously secret internal
documents made public through court cases against Pfizer, Merck and other companies.

The Association of Health Care Journalists does an outstanding job of offering practical advice at
http://www.healthjournalism.org/ and http://www.healthjournalism.org/blog/. AHCJ holds to the
highest standards of ethics in reporting, and it is invaluable for health beat and investigative
reporting.
Investigative Reporters and Editors tracks the best recent health-related investigative work at
http://www.ire.org/extraextra/category/health and allows you to search conference tip sheets by
key words at http://www.ire.org/resourcecenter/tipsheets.php.
Finally, Gary Schwitzer’s Health News Review blog helps us serve readers better – especially in
the drug discovery hype stories that some editors (and some reporters) like so much.
http://www.healthnewsreview.org/ and http://www.healthnewsreview.org/blog/.
Gary’s criteria for what consumers need in stories:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

What's the total cost?
How often do benefits occur?
How often do harms occur?
How strong is the evidence?
Is this condition exaggerated?
Are there alternative options?
Is this really a new approach?
Is it available to me?
Who's promoting this?
Do they have a conflict of interest?
