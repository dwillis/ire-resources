The Detention Boom
(context)
1996: Congress approves “Anti
Terrorism and Effective Death
Penalty Act” and the “Illegal
Immigration Report and
Immigrant Responsibility Act”
2002: Newly minted ICE adopts
“Project Endgame” – 10 year
enforcement strategy.
Impacts: No. of detainees,
deportations have skyrocketed
(“Removals” in 1995: 51,000;
removals in FY2012: 397,000)

Where are immigrants detained in
your town?




Since ‘05, U.S. detention
budget has doubled to $1.7
billion
More than 3 million detainees
in past decade
More than 200 facilities in U.S.
(peaked at more than 400)
Local jails
State prisons
Existing federal prisons
Private detention facilities
(“CoCos”)

Investigating your local detention
center


Check local zoning:




Obtain building file:




Are detention facilities
appropriately sited, safe?

Is project following same
process as other
buildings?

Check NEPA/SEPA
reviews


Siting concerns raised?

Financing detention


Are public agencies in your state helping billion-dollar
contractors finance detention facilities?


Washington Economic Development Finance Authority: Twice
issued $50+ million in bonds to build, expand Northwest
Detention Center



Similar agencies have financed facilities in TX, CO



Why? Big $ in transaction fees!



Bent rules? No local support, jobs created, etc.

Big bucks for detention


FOIA detention contracts to find out “Man/Day” rates


In Tacoma: Current contract provides $100.65/day for first 1,181
detainees, $62.52/day for ea. detainee beyond 1,181 up to 1,575, with
1,181 detainee/day minimum



Total annual contract award: $43.4 million - $52.5 million



Contracts typically involve one year terms with up to four one-year
extensions



Be sure to ask for base contract and all amendments



Seek alternative sources for un-redacted copies

Other contractual obligations
Is contractor living up to contract
terms? Is ICE enforcing the
contract?








Physical plant: Requirements for onsite medical clinics, courtrooms,
special housing, etc.
Employees: Requirements for
contractor to do background checks on
employees and applicants.
Safety: Code inspections, evacuation
plans, and safety agreements in place
and up to date?

Audits: ICE conducts annual audits,
but is enforcing contract terms?
(Check ICE’s FOIA library)

Procurement improprieties?






Are federal detention
contractors winning bids
appropriately?
Local building records, SEC
filings can indicate that
contractors know about / are
working toward a contract
before federal bid
announcements are made.
Compare such records to
federal contract bid/award
history www.fbo.gov

Chronicling immigrants in detention






Check local jail rosters for inmates
with “immigration detainers.”
Send letters to inmate in English &
Spanish to request interview (may
need to be added to visitor list).
Get a family contact (name,
contact info for relative on
outside)



Send money for phone calls (ask
your boss!)



Get lawyer contact info.



Ask subject to sign a waiver
allowing release of Alien File or
“A-file”

Detention story ideas
Immigration bonds
 No bond requirement for
immigration cases.




How often, how long are
detainees being held without
bond or before given bond
hearings on average at your
local immigration court?
Request stats from DOJ’s
Executive Office of
Immigration Review (in charge
of federal immigration courts)
http://www.justice.gov/eoir/

Detention story ideas (cont.)
Secure Communities

Fingerprint-sharing program between
local law enforcement and ICE;
supposed to identify serious criminals - “priority targets.”


Program captures info. on big
numbers of foreign-born U.S.
residents, some here legally or with
minor or no criminal offenses.



Feds are set to expand program to all
law enforcement agencies in 2013.



Some jurisdictions (Chicago) are
refusing to participate.



Why are immigrants being removed
under Secure Communities from your
community?

Misc. story ideas/tips


Request a “fly-along” on a federal
deportation flight.



Request a tour of your local
immigration detention center.





Compare your local detention
center to the nation: How many
detainees are in your local facility
(average daily population)? How long
typically stay (average length of stay)?
How do this compare to national
averages?
Detainees in limbo: Some detainees
– those from nations with no U.S.
recognized governments in place
(Somalia) or whose countries refuse to
take them back under if convicted of
certain heinous crimes (Russia, Iraq,
etc.) – remain in detention for years.
Find out the stories about such
detainees in your local facility.

Misc. story ideas/tips
•



Transfers: Are big numbers of
detainees being transferred from out
of the region to your local detention
center? This can cause hardship on
families who can't visit, and create
challenges for mounting a legal
defense.
Detainee classifications: Are noncriminal detainees housed separately
from criminal detainees? Are men
being separated from women?
Connect with a local detainee:
Detention facilities have weekly or biweekly detainee releases, where
groups of detainees are released at a
certain time and day each week. Find
out when it happens at your local
facility.
