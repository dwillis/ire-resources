Why?

• Reporting to funders
• Making new pitches
• Teaching your audience
• Guiding newsroom decision-making

Story pickups

• Homegrown system:
o Approximately 8 hours/month

• Paid options:

o Universal Information Services
o Meltwater
o Cision
o TVEyes (broadcast)

• Our conclusion: paid options are not reliable
on their own; homegrown is more complete,
not as expensive

 Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism
