Why Reproducible Research ?
Credibility -- Evidence for your story’s truth.
Sharing -- Give other groups a head start.

Quality -- Reinforces good work practices,
e.g. Do It Once, commenting, version control,
no cutting & pasting changes…script everything.
Teamwork – Easier collaboration,
with others and your future self.

Requirements for Reproducibility
1. Include the original unmodified data sources.
2. If raw data is transformed,
preserve that transformation in scripts.
3. Document everything you do
using # comments.
4. Produce a "human digestible" artifact
(.html, .pdf etc.).

Don’t just reproduce….

Don’t just reproduce….
Preplicate !

Preplication =
Replication in a story’s
preparation.

Huh? Preplication by who?
By the folks you’re investigating!
• Share your scripts and data, securely, with
those you plan to write about.
• Invite them to explain, critique, debug,
falsify.
• Wouldn’t you’d do that with documents?

Requirements for Preplicability
1. Include the original unmodified data
sources.
2. If raw data is transformed,
preserve that transformation in scripts.
3. Document your script lavishly,
using # comments.
4. Produce a "human digestible" artifact
(.html, .pdf etc.), with Markdown.

Requirements for Preplicability
(continued)
5. Plain text: it’ll always be in style.
6. Confidentiality: compartmentalize sources
you’re “confronting” from each other’s data.
Don’t publish libelous work-in-progress.
7. Free, open source, cross-platform (R, Jupyter,
PC/Mac)
8. A stable, vanilla software environment
ensures needed software remains available.
