● How to secure your passwords in 30 minutes
● Choosing a password manager
Two-factor authentication:
There are three primary two-factor authentication options available for personal accounts:
● Pretty good:​ SMS-text messaging. This is least 2FA secure option, largely due to the fact
that the messages are unencrypted, and susceptible to SIM hijack. However, keep in mind
that SMS is still a better option us than no 2FA at all.
● Much better:​ Authenticator application. An authenticator application lives on your mobile
device and generates one-time-passwords for you to enter in as 2FA codes.
● The most secure:​ Hardware tokens (aka security keys). This is the most secure 2FA option.
It’s a small physical “key” that you have to directly insert into your device to log in.

Password Managers:
1Password​ is offering free password management accounts to journalists. ​LastPass​ and ​Dashlane
are also great password manager options.
Check for past compromises:
Data breaches happen - the important thing is to make sure you change your passwords for
accounts that were breaches. The following websites are run by security researchers and let you
query databases of breached information to see if accounts associated with your email address
were breached at some point in time. Keep in mind that you likely have had accounts that were
breached - take action by changing your passwords for those accounts:

Secure Browsing
What is a VPN?
● VPN = Virtual Private Network
● Encrypts all internet traffic between your computer and a VPN server
● Not all VPNs are created equal. When choosing a VPN, consider how they protect their
users and their data collection practices. The Wirecutter published a helpful ​article​ about
what VPNs are, when to use VPNs, as well as recommended trusted VPN providers.
When to use a VPN:
● Connecting to any untrusted WiFi network where you may be entering login credentials or
other sensitive information. Comes in handy when traveling.
● Sending sensitive information over non-encrypted applications.
● Conducting research where you don’t want your personal IP address to be hitting the sites
you are accessing.
● Accessing the internet in countries where Internet Service Providers may be controlled by
or have close relationships with the government.
● Accessing the internet in locations where you are concerned your traffic may be monitored.
What is ​Tor​?
● When you normally surf the web, websites you visit can see your IP address. IP addresses
can in turn reveal a lot of information about your location.

●

●

Tor​ is browser that uses a network that routes your internet connection through several
nodes, hosted and run by volunteers around the world. Each node only knows the IP
address of the node “behind” and “in front” of it.
When using the Tor browser, your internet traffic will appear to come from a different IP
address.
