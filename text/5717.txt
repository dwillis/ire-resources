In November 2015, Anna sat on a
patterned couch at the Logan
police station, tearfully telling
Detective Kendall Olsen about the
night she says she was raped by
Utah State University student
Torrey Green.
Green's name was not new to
Olsen. Anna was the third woman
in 2015 to sit on the same couch
and report being sexually
assaulted by the USU linebacker.
Before the month was up, one
more would do the same.

"The most disturbing part of all of this is ... I don't
feel like I have to go after my rapist to get justice for
what he did to me. I feel like I have to go after the
people who were supposed to get the justice for me."

University of Oregon basketball coach Dana
Altman was far more entangled in the school’s
response to a rape allegation against his player
than the school previously acknowledged.
Investigative reporting by Sports Illustrated in
October revealed that, according to analysis of
public documents, the university violated its
obligations under the law and acted at odds
with the school’s own policies upon learning
that Kavell Bigby-Williams, a transfer power
forward from Gillette (Wyo.) College, was
under criminal investigation in Wyoming for an
alleged sexual assault that occurred while he
was a UO student.
UO previously stated Altman was aware police
were looking into Bigby-Williams but didn’t
know what it was about, and did not know the
nature of the allegation.

MICHIGAN STATE
UNIVERSITY administrators
have long claimed, to the federal
government and public, that they
have handled sexual assault,
violence and gender
discrimination complaints
properly.
But an Outside the Lines
investigation has found a pattern
of widespread denial, inaction
and information suppression of
such allegations by officials
ranging from campus police to
the Spartan athletic department,
whose top leader, Mark Hollis,
announced his retirement on
Friday.
The actions go well beyond
the highly publicized case of
former MSU athletic physician
Larry Nassar.

"It was all happening behind closed doors.
... None of it was transparent or included
people who would normally be involved in
certain decisions."

[Officer] Whipple
described in his report
that the marks “looked
to be consistent with
marks produced when
someone is strangled.”
Brown’s girlfriend: “He
has a lot going for him,
I don’t want him to get
in trouble.” ….
Brown is “the last
person to hurt
anybody.”
Before the season began, however, Brown allegedly engaged in a physical fight with linebacker
Paris Bostick in the locker room. …. Bostick said Brown started throwing punches at him while he
was entering the keypad information on his locker. Bostick said he threatened to kill Brown after
teammates broke up the fight because he felt he didn’t get a fair opportunity to fight. He was
immediately suspended from the team and its facilities for threatening to kill a teammate, he
said. Brown was not suspended.

Utah County sheriff's Deputy Edwin
Randolph didn't believe Madi Barney.
Weeks after the Brigham Young University
student reported she was sexually
assaulted, Randolph was alerting
university staff to the rape case — and to
his own skepticism.
Barney "wants to screw up [the suspect's]
life," Randolph told them, according to a
Provo detective's summary of notes taken
by the school's Title IX coordinators.
Her allegation was "bull crap," Randolph
later told the detective in a January
interview.

Sexual assault interview tips
When trying to speak to victims, do it on their terms: meet where/when they
feel comfortable, allow that first meeting to be off the record if necessary. Don't
scare them with cameras on the first day and let them share as much or as little
as possible with you during that first interview -- you can always go back.
2. If a victim says no at first, leave them alone for a few weeks/a month and then
ask, gently, again. They may be more willing the second time.
3. Always try to get the name of the perpetrator, even if you don't use it in the
story. Then request any police reports related to that alleged perpetrator while
they were attending school -- you might find more than you expect.
4. If you're unsure about naming an alleged perpetrator, call an expert to talk
about it. For example, call someone at Poynter to talk through the scenarios and
what the story is really about.
5. Always figure out exactly who they told and when. It's likely that they told
someone who is a mandatory reporter for the school without knowing about it.
That's how you can figure out if the school knew/should have done something
about it.

Helpful records
•

Record barriers
•
•
•

•

•

Names, details often redacted from crime reports
Universities cite the Family Educational Rights and Privacy
Act in redacting and/or denying information
Sensitive information requires a balancing act by law
enforcement, schools and other agencies, but many withhold
more information than is necessary to prevent identification of
victims
Victims names are withheld – and that’s most often
appropriate – but how do you reach them? Many do want to
share their stories.
Some agencies don’t release police reports where someone
hasn’t been charged, but if the story is examining how/if cases
get charged and how they were handled, what do you do?

Know the law before you request! Check out your state’s rules at
www.rcfp.org or www.splc.org .

Overcoming record barriers
•
•
•
•
•

Develop sources among prominent Title IX attorneys,
specifically those who take cases in your jurisdiction
Develop sources within the Title IX office
Develop sources among sexual assault/domestic violence
advocates and counselors on campus and in the community
Challenge overreaching redactions and withholding of
records
Know the limits of FERPA:

• SPLC guide http://www.splc.org/article/2005/05/ferpaand-access-to-public-records
• SPJ guide - https://www.spj.org/ferpa.asp

FERPA Sexual Violence exemption
There is a specific FERPA exemption allowing for the
release of records in cases where a school finds someone
responsible for an act of sexual violence
An institution may disclose to anyone—not just the victim—the final results
of a disciplinary proceeding, if it determines that the student is an alleged
perpetrator of a crime of violence or non-forcible sex offense, and with
respect to the allegation made against him or her, the student has
committed a violation of the institution's rules or policies. See 34 CFR §§
99.31(a)(13) and (14).

Steps of Title IX
There are several steps in a Title IX investigation.
1.
2.

3.

4.
5.
6.

A university launches a Title IX investigation as soon as it gets
word of an act of sexual violence involving student(s).
Either the complainant or respondent can appeal that finding of the
investigation, which could result in no action, suspension, expulsion
or other forms of punishment.
If dissatisfied with how the school handled the complaint, either side
can make a Title IX complaint to the US Dept of Education Office
for Civil Rights (OCR)
OCR may or may not launch a Title IX investigation of the school.
The US Dept of Ed Clery Act office can also investigate overall
reporting.
Anyone can also file a civil Title IX lawsuit in federal court against
the university.

A reported act of sexual violence can result in one – or all – of the above.

Due process
One tenant of the DeVos administration is to put greater emphasis
on due process, which is supported by groups that oppose current
Title IX adjudication and advocate for the accused.
