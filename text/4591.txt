SEVEN TIPS FOR MANAGING AN INVESTIGATIVE TEAM
STORIES SHOULD BE REPORTER AND CONTACT DRIVEN
 The majority of stories an investigative reporter does should be reporter driven. This is how you
turn better, more enterprising stories. Reporters have the best contacts and information and are
not spending all their time in the newsroom. It also keeps your reporters from becoming frustrated
and disenfranchised.
TIPLINE
 This an easy way to connect with viewers and get story ideas. You should have a phone number, a
place on your website and an e-mail. Have the e-mail go to everyone in the unit. This allows
everyone to see them because different tips may resonate with different people. You will get a lot of
crazy calls but it’s the price you pay for good stories.
BE A SOUNDING BOARD
 You need to talk to all your people and allow them to bounce ideas, thoughts, facts, concerns, etc.
off you. This helps them in their process to help vet a story. It allows you to not be surprised along
the way and in the scripting process.
CREATE A COLLABORATIVE ENVIRONMENT
 Your team needs to be able to work in an environment that allows people to share ideas, what they
are working on and ask for feedback from not only you but the other people in the unit.
BRING OUT THE BEST IN YOUR PEOPLE
 Most people that are working on an investigative team are smart, responsible people. One of the
best things you can do is to help your people grow into better reporters, producers, photographers
and editors.
FIGURE OUT WHAT YOUR PEOPLE NEED FROM YOU
 Everyone works differently and your team members need different things from you. If you treat
everyone the same it can be frustrating. Think about how you like to be treated by the person you
work for and how you respond to it. Do you hate working for a micromanager, do you need to talk
through your thoughts and ideas, etc. Don’t mistake this as giving your people what they want.
What they want and what they need are not necessarily the same thing.
BE PASSIONATE ABOUT WHAT YOU DO AND THE PEOPLE YOU DO IT WITH
 We work a lot and most of us do it because it is a passion and/or calling. Life is too short not enjoy
what you do and the people you do it with.
