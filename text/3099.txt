How to use campaign finance data to track fundraising, and
other lobbyist largesse
2008 IRE Conference, Miami, Florida

Washington politicians are tripping over themselves these days to denounce the influence of
lobbyists and special interests. But hardly a breakfast, lunch, dinner or cocktail hour goes by in the
nation's capital when lobbyists are not hosting fundraisers for members of Congress--even for those
members who have loudly complained about their influence. There are very few members who
don’t rely heavily on lobbyists and Political Action Committees to fund their campaigns. This is
neither new nor surprising to the reporters who cover this stuff. But our readers and viewers don't
necessarily understand the extent to which their elected officials rely for money on influencepeddlers, corporate executives and labor leaders who often have a narrow, pecuniary interest in their
decisions.
And here's what is new: After last year's ethics law banned members and staffers from accepting
gifts and meals from lobbyists, fundraising has become the safest and most efficient way for interest
groups to buy access. The same lobbyist who can't treat a lawmaker to a hamburger can provide
him and his friends a private dinner of Kobe beef and Château Lafite Rothschild--as long as it's
accounted for as a fundraiser. As ABC News recently reported, Rep. Dan Lungren of California
used that loophole to have the American Association of Airport Executives send him to their junket
at a Hawaii resort. Lungren paid $4,900 from his campaign for him and his wife to fly there first
class and stay in the resort, and the association threw a fundraiser for him there that raised $20,000.
Here's Big Dan.

When a lobbyist hosts a fundraiser, he is doing a favor that is far more valuable than the maximum
$10,000 check his PAC can write to that member's campaign. But, until the ethics law's new
bundling disclosure rules go into effect, there is no direct reporting of who is hosting fundraisers for
members of Congress, where those events are taking place or how much is being spent on them

Luckily, some of that information is buried in Federal Election Commission records. At USA
Today, we used expenditure and in-kind contribution data to show that lobbyists and corporate
PACs frequently host fundraisers at townhouses they own near the Capitol. We built an interactive
map that showed the location of each townhouse, allowing readers to click on the facility and see
which members had attended fundraisers there. But the methods we used would useful for anyone
trying to identify which lobbyists and special interests are hosting fundraisers for a particular
member of Congress, whethe those fundraisers are at restaurants, clubs, or lobbyist-owned
townhouses.
From there, you can track the payback. We found that House Transportation Chairman James
Oberstar attended a breakfast fundraiser at the UPS House, then later that day chaired a committee
mark-up where he won passage of his UPS-backed proposal to make it easier for workers at rival
FedEx to unionize. Here's Oberstar walking into the UPS House for a later fundraiser, and our
interactive map:

IN-KIND CONTRIBUTIONS AND CAMPAIGN EXPENDITURES: LEARN THE RULES,
FIND THE FUNDRAISERS
Fundraisers cost, and somebody has to pay for the food, drink and facility rental. Those payments
are supposed to be reported in FEC records. Therein lies the roadmap.
When a lobbyist or political action committee hosts a fundraiser for a member, typically either the
member's campaign committee pays or the lobbyist pays. If the lawmaker's campaign pays, the
expense shows up in that committee's FEC disclosures as a CAMPAIGN EXPENDITURE.. If the

lobbyist or PAC pays, it shows up as an IN-KIND CONTRIBUTION. In the case of a PAC, that
would mean it should show up in two places: As an expenditure in the PAC's FEC filing, and as
contribution in the member's FEC filing.
Last year, the FEC issued new rules requiring that committees be more specific in how they report
spending. The rules are often ignored, but the disclosure is getting better, so it's become easier to
identify fundraisers.
If you're looking Congress-wide, Bob Biersack at the FEC press office, (202) 694-1220, can provide
an excel spreadsheet with in-kind contributions by PACs and individuals. But if you're looking at a
particular House member, your best bet is to download their filings from the FEC web site, here:
http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/efile_search.shtml
In-kind contributions are labeled as such, and the ones that represent fundraisers are often pretty
obvious. Here's what some recent Oberstar filings show.

Likewise, with disbursements, there are ways to search through the spending by every member. We
used CQ Moneyline, a subscription web site that allows you to search spending by purpose field,
payee, etc. You could also construct your own database by downloading all expenditures for a
particular period from the FEC web site. But if you are looking at particular candidates, you can
easily download the data by committee. Here, for example, is some spending by House Majority
Leader Steny Hoyer that had the word "fundraising" in the purpose field:

Some of this doesn't tell us enough without further reporting. Fiorello is his fundraising consultant.
But the two payments to Jacobs Engineering suggest that Hoyer had a fundraiser at that giant
government contractor's Capitol Hill townhouse. And the $4549.40 represents fundraising catering
paid for by the Investment Company Institute's PAC. (To make the cash numbers add up, in-kinds
are reported twice: In the contribution field and the expenditure field.)
Another example: Rep. Nancy Boyda of Kansas is a freshman Democrat reformer. When the House
passed the lobbying law last July, Boyda said that the ban on gifts and meals was important to her
constituents because "they want to know that I'm not sitting someplace in Washington, D.C., with
somebody that gets my attention for two solid hours."

On Oct. 15, the Van Scoyoc Associates lobbying firm registered to lobby for Iola, a town in her
district. On Nov. 1, the firm hosted a fundraiser for Boyda at its offices, with the $1,203 cost for
catering, beverages, room rental and incidentals paid for by the firm's PAC. On Dec. 19, Boyda
issued a news release taking credit for earmarking $485,000 for a wastewater treatment project in
Iola.
Van Scoyoc, one of DC's biggest lobbying shops, makes it very easy to track this stuff, because
their PAC does nothing but underwrite fundraisers for members. Most of them take place at their
lovely offices at 101 Constitution Ave., overlooking the Capitol. Tracking the payback is also fairly
straightforward with them, because they represent a lot of local governments that seek earmarks. In
this case, I simply looked through their lobbying disclosures
(http://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/legislative/g_three_sections_with_teasers/lobbyingdisc.htm),
found a Kansas client, and then examined Boyda's earmark requests, which she helpfully posts on
her web site. The Van Scoyoc firm appears to have a policy that it would be the height of
ingratitude not to have a fundraiser for a member from whom the firm is seeking or has secured an
earmark.
A cautionary on dates: The dates in FEC records are often not the dates of the fundraisers. Doublecheck with human sources. Also, the best way to find out about fundraisers in advance is to ask a
lobbyist to send you the invitations with which he is inundated by fax and email.
Beyond fundraisers, there are all sorts of interesting things you find by looking at campaign
spending and in-kind contributions. For example, the NRA's PAC reported paying for artwork, and
FedEx shipping costs, for Missouri's Lieutenant Governor:
