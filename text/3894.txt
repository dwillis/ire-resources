• Look around
• Have the inspectors take you through their job
• Do a ride along
• How often?
• How long does a typical inspection take?
• Announced or surprise
• Brand new, calendar, complaint-based, both?
• Fill-out paper form or tablet?
• Do a keyword search
• Be the business
• Get several years (ask about historical)
• Google

• Daycares
• Restaurants
• School buses
• Elevators
• Escalators
• Fire inspection
• Hoarders/building codes
• Even city parks

• Water (pools, waterways)
• Amusement Parks/Carnivals, carnivals
• Bridges
• Detention inspections
• X-ray inspections
• Division of Weights and Measures
• Gas Stations
• Retail
• Scales

• OSHA workplace safety inspections
• OSHA on crack
• Nursing home, hospital and home health data from Medicare
• Nursing home inspections from Propublica
• FDA Inspection Classification System
• USDA
• Medical facilities
• Buses
• Trucks
• The list goes on

• Date modified and date created
• Following time table (Inspections are worthless if they are outof-date)
• Inspectors’ log
• How much are they doing?
• How do they compare against each other?

• Manpower
• Contractors

• Data are just part of the picture (Request paper inspections,
narratives, memos)
• All data are dirty
• What’s the bar? Compare your results to something for context.
• Inspection data is regularly updated

• Fines: are they paid/reduced
• Agency following own enforcement?
• Are there penalties/enforcement?
• Appeals
• Suspension/Closure
• Repeat offenders
