FIND THE STORY
HIDDEN IN THE DATA
Documents and numbers don’t do you any good if
they don’t enlighten or foster understanding

COMPARE AND
CONTRAST
Offer your audience context by showing the differences in
results between circumstances and location

MAKE DOCUMENTS
CHARACTERS IN
YOUR STORY

SHOW ME THE
MONEY
Television, social, and digital are all visual platforms
Leverage that power by SHOWING your audience why they
should care

EXTREME DATA
