STATE SITES:

This National Institute on Money in State Politics site compiles state-by-state data

interactive map for the U.S. at
http://www.followthemoney.org/database/nationalview.phtml.
It allows searches for individual state legislative districts at

And its archive of reports http://www.followthemoney.org/research/index.phtml

Maintained by the National Institute on Money in State Politics, this is a repository
of links to disclosure offices in all 50 states regarding campaign finance, lobbying
and ethics data. It is NOT easy to find on the group’s website, so use this link and
bookmark.
FEDERAL SITES:
MapLight: http://maplight.org/
This website seeks to shine a light on the relationship between Money And Politics
(MAPlight, get it?). It tracks how donations by interest groups correlate to the
votes taken by specific lawmakers on specific bills. The site is set up to track
congressional legislation as well as bills in Wisconsin and California. Searches can
be done by bills, legislators, interest groups, contributions, companies and topics.

Center for Responsive Politics: http://www.opensecrets.org

The Center for Responsive Politics site tracks federal campaign contributions by
candidate and race.
Donor searches can be done by individual name, by state, and by employer.
http://www.opensecrets.org/indivs/index.php
What the center uniquely does is classify contributions by company and business
interest. http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/index.php
How much specific industries gave to the presidential candidates:

Washington Post interactive website on campaign commercials:
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/track-presidentialcampaign-ads-2012
Tracks weekly and total ad spending for the 2012 presidential race by candidate,
PAC and interest group, using data mined from Kantar Media's Campaign Media
Analysis Group. It counts only ads that have actually aired, not total buys
announced by campaigns or other groups. Allows for searches of ad spending for
each media market.
Federal Election Commission: http://www.fec.gov
The FEC's website is the primary source for campaign finance reports for
candidates, political parties and political action committees. You can either look up
reports or download the data.

For Senate reports, which are filed on paper:
http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/imaging_info.shtml
To look up individual donors by name:

The best feature on this site is the group's Party Time, which tracks fundraisers for
candidates. You can search by sponsor or candidate. http://politicalpartytime.org
ProPublica PACTrack: http://projects.propublica.org/pactrack/
Real-time feed of independent expenditures and contributions, with graphs and
stats showing share of top donors’ contribution to each PAC.
WORKING WITH FEC DATA:

Daily FEC Filings, ASCII28 Delimited
Every day, the FEC adds a ZIP file of ASCII28 delimited “.fec” spreadsheets to
their FTP site.
ftp://ftp.fec.gov/FEC/electronic/
FEC ASCII28 Delimiter Character
To use the FEC’s spreadsheets in Excel, hit the download link on this gist, open the
file in a text editor and copy the ASCII28 character. Then, open the .fec file in
Excel and paste the ASCII28 character in the delimiter dialog box.
