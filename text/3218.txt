Farm subsidy data
First European data got out in Denmark in 2004. The 30th of April this year all EU member states are forced to publish data on farm
subsidies to every single recipient. Also other subsidy-payments are published. Under the new legislation the first publications of
beneficiaries had to be made by 30 September 2008 on rural development for payments made in the period 1 January to 15
October 2007. And then 30 April 2009 we shall have it all.
Farmsubsidy.org has requested data, downloaded data from different sources from 2005. Normally it’s much easier to search for
payments on the farm subsidy website.
From UK, Sweden and Denmark we have got a lot more detailed files – the crossfiles – which are extracts of the files the country
has to handle over to the Commission.
All these data are structured in Access databases with documentation. If you need you can from me get a link to download such
databases. Journalists in Europe and US has used this possibility for more in-depth analysis.
We hope for medias to go for the next level of stories - for instance concrete misuse of public money.

Fish subsidy data
The Pew Charitable Trusts is doing a similar project on fish subsidies. The website will open later this spring and also contain a lot
of data on subsidies from 1994 and to now.

Lobbyism register in EU is not good enough
In 2008 the Commission launched a voluntary lobby transparency register, which in many ways are not good. The compliance rate
is alarmingly low and the overall quality of information disclosed is very poor. But still it’s the beginning. The organization Alter-EU
extract the register every day and publish blogs and reports on the basis of this extraction. Later it might publish it as a database
on the web.
The Alliance for Lobbying Transparency and Ethics Regulation (ALTER-EU) is a coalition of over 160 public interest groups, trade
unions, academics and public affairs firms concerned with the increasing influence exerted by corporate lobbyists on the political
agenda in Europe

Business data
A Digital Guide for Tracking Corruption contains good links to get business information in a lot of different countries. This report
from November 2008 was written by Stefan Candea from Romanian Center for Investigative Journalism.

Status of possibilities to get European data
A growing numbers of NGO’s and journalists are working to get data and use them for analysis and stories – very practical. They
use national regulation on access, EU-regulation, and specific regulation on access to environmental data.
Some politicians and authorities are open to this development, others try to fight it. So it’s a rather hard battle and not possible to
point out a clear picture.
If you need data the best advice is to cooperate with a colleague in this country – and to be sure to get one with experience in
crossing through getting data. Try for instance to look on this site to find somebody to work with:
