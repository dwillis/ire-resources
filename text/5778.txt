Introductions
Say your name, where you work, what’s title and what your title should be.

First, finding the time
Pre-report! You can’t pitch a story without knowing something about it. Data
stories are the same.
Try to build time into your schedule to look for interesting data sets, conduct
record requests, clean the data and do initial analyses.

First, finding the time
Pre-report! You can’t pitch a story without knowing something about it. Data
stories are the same.
Try to build time into your schedule to look for interesting data sets, conduct
record requests, clean the data and do initial analyses.
But wait! That’s like 90 percent of the work.

First, finding the time

As you do more data projects it becomes easier to convince your supervisor
that you need to build pre-reporting time into your schedule.

First, finding the time
FOIA Friday. A steady stream of requests means that you’ll always have
something good to work on.
Keep a time diary to prove how long requests and data cleaning can take.
Calendar reminders (group calendar for shared staffing).
Dedicated work days.
Pick a data “beat.” It’s easier to know that you’ll get something out of a dataset as
you become an expert in the area.
You can build newsroom goodwill with each additional project.

Finding the Team
Who can dedicate the necessary time?
● Trip to west Texas for a week
Who is interested in the topic/type of project?
● Political, energy, financial coverage
Who already knows the work/skills required?
● Data producer, reporter, photog
Who will need training? How much?
● Is that feasible?

Group work
What are the challenges you’ve faced to
building a team?
What’s worked?

How to pitch: Audio feature
Clear thesis: It’s much harder to skip around with different characters, places or
conflicts in audio because the user can’t just go back to remind themselves where
you had left off. The listener needs to be able to remember what the story is.
Characters: You have to be able to illustrate what is happening through the
people it is happening to.
Conflict: What’s at stake? Why should the audience care about these characters?
Good scenes: How will you take the audience with you?
Access: Explain how you will get audio of all of the above.

Common story archetypes, not just for print

Success: 2017 California Fires - What Went Wrong
What I knew pre-pitch:
●
●
●
●

Evacuation alert data: When alerts were sent out, where they were
sent and to how many people. Dispatch audio of calls for evacuations
Fire boundaries: MODIS satellite information. Where the fires were,
when from dispatch tape and 911 logs
Electrical problems: Reported electrical incidents
We had to do something

Starting a Data Project
Before the pitch:
●
●
●
●

Obtain & filter data: all state employees
Look for trends: few women & minorities
Understand what you have: expert explainer
Find the team: reporter, researcher, photog

After the pitch:
●
●

Gather more evidence: lawsuits, complaints
Contact victims, lawmakers & “culprit”

Failure: K-12 Title IX Investigations
What happened:
Requested Title IX FOIAs to
follow-up on university release
Education reporter uninterested
Data overwhelmed manager
(sign of a bad pitch)
Result:
Story didn’t get off the ground

Starting a Data Project
Before the pitch:
●
●
●
●

Request data on missed weapons
Find existing elements: video/audio, records
Evaluate roadblock: legal loophole allowing
police to withhold evidence in closed base
Abandon or move forward? Time investment

After the pitch:
●
●

Seek out information to build database
Use the roadblock to your advantage

How to pitch: Two-way
Many data stories may have no sound at all or don’t have a compelling narrative.
These types of stories make better “two-ways,” which is when a host asks you to
explain the story. You hear these all the time on air.
What did you find?
Why are you talking about this now?
How does that impact the listener?
Who does this impact? And when?

Convincing the boss
Doing homework
Preparing/streamlining
Anticipating questions

Does this story have viewer value? Or is it just interesting?
● 30 years of autopsies, millions of taxpayer dollars
Will this story break new ground? Does it have a larger theme?
● Connecting case mistakes, explaining caseload problems
Will this story have visual evidence of the problem? Easy to understand?
● Numbers will fuel this story. Create our own database. Find cases.

Data audio stories are all about context and character

Use numbers sparingly
Use the host lede to introduce a trend
Use a character to illustrate the data

Use numbers sparingly

KQED/Reveal: My World Was Burning

Use the host lede to introduce the numbers

Use a character to illustrate the data

ProPublica/NPR: Black Mothers Keep Dying After Giving Birth.
Shalon Irving's Story Explains Why

Audio: Use repetition

Managing managers
Give your managers options. Have a gameplan.
●
●

Know how you can do a thing. And how you want to be able to do a thing.
What’s the best scenario? The worst? The MVP?

Create a timeline based on tasks.
●
●

How long will each task take?
Bake in time for things to go wrong (things will go wrong).

How to be right: You need a data analysis editor
Always take someone through your work.
Reproduce your analysis. Better yet, have someone else reproduce your analysis.
Find a data editor. This person doesn’t have to be in your own newsroom.

Promotions Red Flag
Use Caution With Numbers
Why to avoid:
● Promoting numbers can make last-minute changes difficult.
● Promoting numbers can lead to mistakes.
● Promoting specific numbers can give away the whole story.
● Time/space constraints can lead to confusion.
If you use:
● Simplify with generalities: millions, hundreds, etc.
● Triple check all elements: on-air, online, social, outside advertising

Corrections and feedback
Be transparent!
Separate story explaining how you did the investigation
Publish your analysis when possible
Offering up the raw data
Social engagement
