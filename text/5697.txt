TOP TIPS
 LISTEN, LISTEN, LISTEN. The best investigative

stories come from people who pay attention.
Listen to them not only for dailies but also for
long-term tips.
 Read everything that is put out by the
department that you cover. Investigative
kernels can hide in plain sight.
 Know what information is kept by the agency
and request it every year.
 Know what information is publicly available
and monitor it. Put the date it comes out on a
Google calendar!

TOP TIPS

 Investigations aren’t a thing apart from beat

reporting. Every story is a potential deep dive.
 Partner up! Find allies in your newsroom who can
pick up the slack when you’re busy on daily
stories, and vice versa. The buddy system also
keeps you on track.
 Ignore the scrum and go turning over rocks
nobody is looking at. Find the most obscure offices
and agencies, ones not used to getting attention.
 Make the lead-ups and follow-ups to investigations
part of your beat.
 After a big project, revisit the rabbit holes. Get as
much mileage out of an investigation as you can
without boring your audience.

FIGURING OUT WHAT’S IMPORTANT
 Take stock of everything you do and

decide if it is important enough to keep
doing.
 No one can do everything all the time. You
can try but it won’t work.
 When you identify a key priority and need
to close on it – that’s when you go all out.
 QUESTION: How do you decide what
important and worth your time?

DROP TURN OF THE SCREW

 Turn of the screw – writing about

every little development to your
own detriment.
 Sometimes four stories are much
more powerful than eight.
 Try to tell a story with every
article. If you can’t, maybe its not
the article to write.
 For example: I shot and there’s
someone dead in Mexico.
 Try using metrics as a way to try
and weed things out.
 QUESTION: What story have
you dropped or could in the
future?

YOU REALLY ARE CRAZY
 There is no way to not feel like you are

missing something. So own that.
 Use your anxiety to your advantage.
 Feeling needled by your boss? Go needle
your sources or the targets of your story.
 Freaking out that you aren’t as far as you
should be? Use that feeling to grind out
what you need to do.
 Feel like you are missing stories – focus
on what’s really important and keep
ploughing forward.
 Listen to your gut instincts

USE THE NEWS CYCLE TO YOUR ADVANTAGE
 Use the news cycle to give velocity to your enterprise
and investigative stories.

 If possible, publish the story when it’s going to get the

most impact.

 Example: Damning audit used in story about school

voucher expansion push.

 Work fast to so breaking news won’t render the subject of

your story moot.

 Be flexible and adjust the schedule based on new

developments.

 Above all, don’t give up on your story even if breaking

news has pre-empted what you are working on.

ROLLING WITH THE PUNCHES
 Nothing is going to go

exactly as planned so don’t
freak out when it happens.
 Investigation and beat work
is more an art than a
science, know when to push,
when to pull back.
 Leave some space for
eureka moment and
understand this work
involves some degree of
chance – embrace that.

LISTEN, LISTEN, LISTEN
 Really the best investigative stories come from beat

reporters and gadflies who pay attention.

 If you hear the same complaint more than once, look into

it. Don’t ignore conspiracy theories or people who
everyone thinks is crazy.

 Carry your card and give it to everyone, from the person

who sits at security to the custodian to the head of
organization who has vowed never to talk to you. If your
phone number or email is handy, they are way more likely
to call, either on a daily or for an investigative tip.

 QUESTION: When have you found an investigative

story doing beat work? How did you execute it?

READ EVERYTHING
 Read everything that is put out by the

department that you cover. There are often
tips hiding in there.
 Pay attention to change orders, transfers of
funds, contracts (especially single source
contracts), any grant reports, hiring and
firings.
 Often this information can be used for both
short-term dailies as well as longer-term
enterprise.

REQUESTS TO MAKE, ALERTS TO CREATE
 Know what information is kept by

the agency and request it every
year.
 Request email and phone
number directories of every
employee. This way, when a story
breaks, you can put it in context
quickly and can do a better next
day story and monitor trends.
 Know what information is
publicly available and monitor it.
Put dates on a Google calendar
when the information should be
coming every year, so you know
to look for it.

MAP RELATIONSHIPS ON YOUR BEAT
 Keep your own

relationship maps for
top employees and
for owners of
companies getting
big contracts.
 Find out who went to
the same colleges,
who contributed to
who, people who live
in the same
neighborhood, who
sends their children
to the same private
schools.

@SSKedreporter

 This can help you

for both shortterm and longterm stories.

KEEPING IRONS IN THE FIRE
 Create a pipeline

of public records.
Make weekly
requests part of
your beat. Even if it
doesn’t get you a
story, it might give
you some insight.
 Meet regularly with
sources! Let them
know you haven’t
dropped the story.
#IRE18
@spsullivan

 Don’t drop stories

because of
deadlines, which are
the enemy of
accountability.
Follow up until you
get answers. Don’t
lose a war of attrition
with government
agencies.

MANAGING YOUR EDITORS
 Sometimes forgiveness is better than

permission. If you’ve got a hunch, start
reporting the story before anybody can
tell you not to bother.
 Don’t overpromise and under-deliver.
 No editor will refuse a better story than
the one you promised them at the pitch
meeting.
 Have regular ”enterprise meetings” to
discuss what you’ve done and what you
need to do.
 Find allies in your newsroom.
#IRE18
@spsullivan

MANAGING YOUR EDITORS
 Stories beget stories, and scoops earn

you goodwill.
 If you build a track record of
delivering, editors will be more willing
to give you room to breathe.
 QUESTION: When do you tell your
immediate editor about an
enterprise story? When do they tell
their boss?
