A quick guide to collaboration
Getting started: Which story ideas work best for collaboration?
-- Chronic problem that hasn’t been well-covered. (Example: Sexual assaults on campuses.)
-- Widespread problem with strong local angles. Data may be analyzed by an expert and shared with all
partners, providing a unique story for each partner. (Example: Use of dangerous acid at oil refineries.)
-- Emerging issue that requires deep dives into specific states or communities. (Example: Funding cuts in
public mental health programs.)
-- Breaking story that requires more bodies or specialized knowledge. (Example: Computer-assisted
analysis of a sample of 50,000 emails sent to Wisconsin’s governor.)
-- Stories that can only be accomplished by marrying specialties. (Example: Whooping cough epidemic in
California that required scientific know-how and data chops.)

Teaming up: Which partnerships make sense?
-- Each organization remains true to its mission.
-- Each organization knows and trusts the other partners. In early stages, collaborations are necessary to
build trust.
-- Each organization gains something valuable by collaborating.
-- The reach of the story is expanded, either to a mass audience or to targeted audiences such as ethnic
populations, through the collaboration.
-- The distribution of the story is increased through involvement of multiple forms of media
organizations.
-- The number of partners is small enough to make real collaboration possible.
-- The impact of the story is increased through collaboration.
-- Funding becomes available because of the collaboration.

Dividing the work: What’s the best role for each news organization, given the mix
of resources, workload and deadline?
-- One newsroom may already have become the “expert” through earlier reporting.
-- Will the reporting be conducted independently, or jointly?
-- Someone has to be in charge. Who will organize the project? Who will keep all the moving parts on
course? Who will oversee the editing?
-- Who has data skills?
-- Will the project cross multiple platforms? How will these be coordinated?
-- Which skills are needed, and what’s the best way to use folks according to their skills?
-- Who will file FOIAs?
-- Who has strong human sources?
-- Who will fact-check?
-- Who will edit? Independently or jointly?
-- Who will handle legal vetting?
-- Who is responsible for photos, graphics and multimedia?

Getting it done: How does the project stay on track?
-- Will there be meetings?
-- How often will memos be updated?
-- Will the newsrooms freely share their findings as the work progresses?
-- How will information be shared -- emails, Google Docs, Basecamp?
-- Who will be “in charge”?

Getting it out: How will the project be edited and released to the public?
-- Will the editors from each newsroom work independently, or as a team?
-- Will this be a jointly produced package, or will each newsroom release its own version of the findings?
-- How will any disagreements be resolved?
-- When the project is released, will it be shared with additional news organizations?
-- Will the package be released under an embargo?
-- What types of marketing (social media, blogs, news releases, personal contacts, etc.) will be used, and
who will handle that?
-- Who is responsible for final legal reviews, fact-checking and copyediting?
-- If corrections are required, how will they be handled?

Hall, at www.kcnn.org. Chapter Eight focuses upon collaboration.
