Social Network Analysis:
Tools for connecting the dots

David Donald, Data Editor

The Kansas City Star
Data: Documents from the U.S. Treasury
Department used to create a data table for
social network analysis.
Findings: Analysis showed that officials from
Islamic African Relief Agency, a global charity,
allegedly used $5 million to perform services
or favors for bin Laden and his organizations
and other terrorists.

The Washington Post
Data: Built database of George W.
Bush “Pioneers” – those who raised
more than $100,000 to his 2000
presidential campaign.

Findings: Sarah Cohen used
social network analysis to show who
the key Pioneers were in the Bush
campaign, who they were
connected to, and what each
Pioneer gained, if anything, from his
or her association with Bush, such
as ambassadorships and other
federal appointments. Bush raised
$96.3 million, a record at that time.
More that 100, about 40 percent, of
the Pioneers received some federal
appointment after the election.
