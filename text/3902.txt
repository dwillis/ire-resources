Data and data-based reporting are hot right now and the reason is quite simple:
Incorporating these skills and this information into your work can produce better journalism.
Don’t miss out on opportunities to do stories that set you apart from the pack. In this tipsheet
we’ll offer you some story ideas, sites and advice to help get you going.

Why data?
More and more records are kept electronically. We can use those records to:



Quickly add context to a story or dig deeper on breaking news
Watchdog government officials, regulators and agencies, businesses, nonprofits and
more
Do stories that no one else is doing

When news breaks think how can I use data?



Hit singles, work up to home runs
Never underestimate the power of a spreadsheet
Add weight as the lifting becomes easier (do harder and harder data stories as you
become comfortable handling and working with small and easier databases)
Challenge assumptions
Keep an option mind about what data can tell you
Practice, practice, practice
Create a narrative around data
Make data work for you in telling a compelling story not the other way around
