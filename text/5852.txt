KOMU 8 News mapped out all of the
hospitals and ambulance bases in
mid-Missouri and found that:
• Nine counties in its viewing area do
not have a hospital.
• Numerous cities and towns are at
least 25 minutes away from the
closest hospital.
• Even though ambulances can
legally drive faster than the speed
limit, on many of the roads in rural
Missouri, that's not possible.

• Nursing home inspection reports
to identify cases of abuse or
neglect
• Medicaid/Medicare

examine staffing and other
