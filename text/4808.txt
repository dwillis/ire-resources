Following the Money
Sure it's a cliche. But it's still some of the best advice in journalism: track
the funds to find the power, or the problems, or the answers. Three
veteran journalists give tips and examples that will help you find the key
money trails in your own stories.

Tracking the Dollars
• Doesn't always mean you can trace funds that people don't want you
to see.
• We don't have subpoena power. But there are reams of public records
and other tools that can provide enough information to pierce the
barriers that lawyers, government bureaucrats and others often put
up to conceal the flow of money.
• We will provide examples of public records that helped open up
reporting to show large-scale business fraud, government and police
corruption and at least one major Ponzi scheme.

Connecting the dots
• As reporters, we’ll probably only get access to snapshots of money
flows.
• A random account statement here, a court judgement there and
maybe even assets revealed in a divorce case.
• Though we don’t usually get A to B to C to D, we often get glimpses of
the money flow—enough to move the story forward to the next
stage.
• That often leads to key sources who can help draw more connections.

Step by step: Peeling the layers
1. If you have access, get broad company reports first. Company and
corporate filings, court documents.
2. Then dig in secretary of state records. In some states, like Florida,
you have access to documents. Sometimes there are clues.
3. Each set of filings may have one nugget that will open doors.
4. Get the names of key executives and addresses. Cross-reference.
Keep unraveling step by step.
5. Be creative.

A sampling of key sources
• State regulatory records
• State corporate records
• Local government agency records
• Emails
• Inspector general reports (federal
and state)
• Lawsuits (depositions and other
discovery materials)
• Police reports
• Criminal court records
• Campaign filings (federal and state)
• Trademark office

• Divorce records
• Government contracts
• Candidate Income/asset disclosures
• UCC filings
• SEC filings
• Social media
• 990s
• US Patent Office
• Import/export records (US customs)
• Human sources: former employees,
law enforcement

Exhaust all available records
• The hints of what you are looking for are invariable contained in these
treasure troves.
• State records often compliment harder-to-obtain federal records.
• Very little media scrutiny on most state records.
• Some states like Delaware are highly secretive.
• But companies seeking to do business in states with more transparent
records laws, like Florida and Massachusetts, must file in those states,
too.

• Often, these records provide snapshots of the money that may tucked
away in an offshore account or a Delaware shell.
• If you're lucky, there's a copy of a bank statement bundled in the files
of a contentious legal dispute (divorce and otherwise) or even a bank
transfer receipt of funds sent to a Panama bank.
• You rarely get a complete picture of the money flow, but you can
often get enough information to advance an investigation (and ask
the right questions).
• There are many ways to carry the information to the next level.
Obviously, finding the right people to interview and more importantly,
asking the right questions

State regulatory records
• Perhaps one of the most underrated tools in tracing money.
• States often play a dual role with the federal government in regulating
various industries, including insurance, mortgage, securities, and even
banks doing business in those states.
• These records, including investigations and disciplinary actions for
violations of state laws, can provide reams of rich material.

Example: Allen Stanford
• The case of offshore banker Allen Stanford offers one of the most
compelling examples of how obscure state reports helped The Miami
Herald reveal how Stanford carried out one of the largest Ponzi
schemes in U.S. history.

Where did Stanford get the money to launch
his banking empire?
• Records held by the state banking division showed:
• Stanford’s Miami trust office was supposed to be a place where foreign
customers could meet bank officers.
• To avoid scrutiny, Stanford promised regulators no money would change
hands.

State records held the answer
• Though the state was supposed to monitor the office, regulators
didn’t show up for three years.
• In that time, trust officers quietly sold hundreds of thousands in
bogus CDs in the office—in direct violation of state and federal laws—
in what became seed money for Stanford to set up his worldwide
banking empire, records showed.

The Herald obtained emails
between state regulators and
Stanford's attorneys that showed
the state's chief banking counsel
opposed the agreement.
But the state went ahead anyway
and approved the special office in
1999. Ten years later, Stanford
was arrested for defrauding tens
of thousands of investors who
bought the bogus CDs—many at
the Miami office.

Some examples

• Keeping track: License to Launder
• US Patent Office: Homes for the Taking
• Campaign finance: Hidden shell companies
• SEC filings: Insider trades and activist investors

Don’t forget about
• Divorce records
• Some of the most revealing documents to identify ownership, assets and
income.

• Social media
• Mine photos. Find out about relationships, meetings and parties.

• Administrative records
• Regulatory records often contain a wealth of information about disputes and
government disciplinary actions.

• Nonprofit filings
• Details about employee salaries, grants and sources of revenue.

Keeping track: Spreadsheets
• In addition to records, there's a simple task that reporters can carry
out in their mission to track the money.
• You don't have to be an accountant to create spreadsheets. Math
skills and careful reporting will work.
• Using Excel or Google, reporters can add, subtract and divide to find
glaring discrepancies that can lead to stories about government waste
and much worse.
• Math doesn’t lie.

In 1996, financial institutions
filed 62,473 suspicious
activity reports (SARs) on
their customers.
In 2015, they filed 1,851,866.

One reason for the growth: SAR
laws were enhanced after the
terrorist attacks of Sept. 11,
2001.
Most SARs have nothing to do
with terrorism.

There are no agreed upon estimates
of the cost of the surveillance system,
nor its efficacy.

Under the law, risky customers must
be watched more closely. In many
cases, banks simply shut the
accounts of these customers in a
practice known as “derisking.”

Very few people want to talk about this.
Banks do not want to talk about widespread
account closures.
Customers don’t want to admit their
accounts have been closed. It carries a
stigma. What did they do to deserve it?

One group has been hit hard: transfer companies
that help immigrants send money home.
In 2014, immigrants in the U.S. sent $54 billion
abroad, the World Bank estimates.
In some places, this money is vital to the entire
country’s economy.

With a fractured government and half its
population out of work, Somalia is one such
country.
Roughly 30% of its GDP, or as much as $2 billion,
comes from money sent home by the Somali
diaspora.

This is how that money now moves.
