Verification Tools

Tips for reverse image searching
● Try screenshots AND image URLs
○ If you use the URL, the page metadata can influence the search.
This could help, or it could mislead.
○ Screenshot is better when taking an image from social media.
● Add keywords to you search to improve results
● Crop down to just the people you want to identify.
● Double-check your results. The same image could generate
different results.

Social media verification
Some best practices:
○ Find the first instance of the content. Search across as many social sites as possible.
○ Review the creator’s social history.
○ Pick up the phone and talk to the source. Requesting permission to publish/broadcast
their photo/video.
○ Corroborate the details of the event that’s depicted.
○ Identify someone in the newsroom who can sign off on the verification you have
performed.
Thanks to Fergus Bell of Dig Deeper Media for these tips!

If This, Then That
● Save tweets automatically!
○ By hashtag
○ By location
○ By (or mentioning) a
user
● Calendar triggers -- remind
yourself to follow up on a
