Regular Expressions:
Here is a quick list of the regex queries and the GREL command we will be using to clean up the data:
Text Target:​Filter on each unique incident
Sample Text:​POL405 RUN DATE: 3/12/2016 13:41:34 A.R.M.S. PAGE 1
Regex Query:​^C\d
GREL:​value.match(/^(C\d.+)\s.+?/)[0]
Text Target:​Location
Sample Text:​600 BLOCK OF DANIEL ST E KAMS
Regex Query:​LOCATION\:(.+)
GREL:​value.match(/^LOCATION\:(.+)/)[0]
Text Target:​Incident Date
Sample Text:​OCCURRED: 1/28/2016 23:00 REPORTED: 3/10/2016 7:03
Regex Query:​OCCURRED\:(.+)REPORTED.+
GREL: ​
value.match(/^OCCURRED\:(.+)REPORTED.+/)[0]

OpenRefine
Start new project and import text:

See a page like this:

Trim all the leading and trailing whitespace:

Create a new column to hold the unique incidents:

Fill out the column details:

Create a column to add the locations:

Create a column to hold the date:

Remove the original column:

OpenRefine should look like this:

Move incident column to the left:

Split the column into incident and crime:

Should look like this:

Remove incident column, rename “incident 1” to “incident” and “incident 2” to “crime”:

Move location column to the left:

OpenRefine should look like this:

Fill down on each column except the date:

OpenRefine will look like this:

Facet by blank:

From Facet menu, choose “true”:

From “All” column, choose Edit Rows ­> Remove All Matching Rows:

Remove the Date facet:

Create Text Facet on Crime:

Choose Cluster ­> Metaphone 3:

Select boxes to merge, click Merge Selected & Re­Cluster:

Try a few different clustering algorithms:

Browse through facet and fix records:

Create Filters and change records:

Trim “Date” column, then split Date Column into date and time:

OpenRefine should now look like this:

Choose “Export” in the top/right corner, and click on “Comma­separated value” to create a .csv
file for your project. You can use the csv for a database, further analysis, or creating a map.
A map created using the CSV uploaded to CartoDB:
