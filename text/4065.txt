• A data set is only as good as the reporting on
which it’s based.
• Always know where it comes from and how
it’s carved.
• Always beware of comparisons.

Checkups for doctors

Medicare Exclusions Database
• http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov/
• Allows health care institutions and the
public to search for individuals and entities
excluded from participation in Medicare,
Medicaid and other federal health care
programs.
• Exclusions can be based on billing fraud
and/or inadequate quality of care.
• Database, known officially as the LEIE,
also includes reinstatements.

State Medical Boards
• Transparency, approach vary widely from
state to state
• Federation of State Medical Boards has
searchable data of actions reported by all
states: http://www.fsmb.org/m_fpdc.html
• Hearing records and legal filings often
contain best information (i.e. complaints
drafted for administrative hearings).

National Practitioner Data Bank
• NPDB Public Use File:
http://www.npdb.hrsa.gov/resources/publicData.jsp
• Does not include names or identifying info for
individual physicians; does include state licensure
actions, malpractice payments, clinical privilege
actions and other info
• Still useful:
– Can determine if state boards are reporting actions to
NPDB, as required
– Can determine if state boards are taking action when docs
lose clinical privileges or compile especially bad records on
malpractice claims (numbers or size of settlements).
– Can sometimes track doctors by comparing state board
records to NPDB (each doc in NPDB, while anonymous,
has a unique identifier)

Our findings
• Doctors disciplined or banned by hospitals often keep clean licenses: From
2001 to 2011, nearly 6,000 doctors had their clinical privileges restricted or
taken away by hospitals and other medical institutions for misconduct
involving patient care. But 52% — more than 3,000 doctors — never were
fined or hit with a license restriction, suspension or revocation by a state
medical board.
• Even the most severe misconduct goes unpunished: Nearly 250 of the
doctors sanctioned by health care institutions were cited as an "immediate
threat to health and safety," yet their licenses still were not restricted or
taken away. About 900 were cited for substandard care, negligence,
incompetence or malpractice — and kept practicing with no licensure action.
• Doctors with the worst malpractice records keep treating patients: Among the
nearly 100,000 doctors who made payments to resolve malpractice claims
from 2001 to 2011, roughly 800 were responsible for 10% of all the dollars
paid and their total payouts averaged about $5.2 million per doctor. Yet
fewer than one in five faced any sort of licensure action by their state
medical boards.

Prescribing data
• Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Data

– Via CMS:
http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Prescription-Drug-Coverage/Prescr
– Via Pro Publica Prescriber Checkup (best tool):
http://projects.propublica.org/checkup/

• DEA ARCOS data (Automation of Reports and
Consolidated Orders System)
– http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/arcos/
– Shows prescription rates for opiates, various drugs,
by zip (first three digits); Does not identify specific
docs
– Available by request only

Checkups for hospitals

Medicare Provider Charge Data:
– Provides hospital-by-hospital data showing what
each charges for the 100 most common inpatient
services and 30 common outpatient services.
– Allows comparisons among hospitals within a
community, a region, or nationwide.

– http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Sys

CMS Hospital Compare

– http://www.medicare.gov/hospitalcompare/search.h
– Find hospitals by name, city, county, state, or
ZIP code.
– Check the results of patient surveys (what
patients said about their hospital
experiences).
– Compare the results of certain measures of
quality that show how well these hospitals
treat certain conditions.

Hospitalinspections.org
• http://www.hospitalinspections.org/
• Database of hospital inspection reports,
maintained by the Assoc. of Health Care
Journalists
• Inspections (“surveys” in FedSpeak) are done by
states on behalf of CMS
• Includes “deficiencies” cited during complaint
inspections at acute-care and critical access
hospitals throughout the United States since Jan.
1, 2011.
• Does not include hospital responses to
deficiencies cited during inspections (Those can
be obtained by filing a request with a hospital or

Other resources for evaluating
hospitals

• Medicare claims data:
http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems
– All identifying info for individual doctors redacted from
public use file, but still useful for looking at hospital-level
claims data

• Lawsuits
– State court databases
– Courtlink
• Multiple states, but not all, and not all courts in each

• State HAI data
– HAI Focus (http://haifocus.com/) offers detailed info on
each state’s reporting laws and requirements.
– Collection, availability varies greatly by state
– Data quality and reporting oversight suspect in some
states

Checkups for nursing homes

• Nursing Home Compare:

– http://www.medicare.gov/NursingHomeCompare/search.html
– Searchable CMS database: inspection/complaint info,
quality measures, penalties, staffing info for all
Medicare/Medicaid-certified nursing homes (>15,000
nationwide).

• CMS Five-Star Quality Rating System data:

– http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Provider-Enrollment-and-Certif
– Downloadable, raw data on which CMS quality measures
are based, including full text deficiencies tables, staffing
tables and various tables listing quality measures.

• Pro Publica Nursing Home Inspect:
http://projects.propublica.org/nursing-homes/
– A more robust tool for searching CMS data, including
unredacted inspection reports.

• State Nurse Aide Registries
– Each state maintains a list to check the
certification and background of certified nurse
aides (aka nurse assistants), who provide the
vast majority of hands-on nursing home care.
– Information varies by state, but always
includes any findings of abuse, neglect,
theft/exploitation
– List with links to all 50 states’ registries:
http://www.ncdhhs.gov/dhsr/hcpr/links.html

Other nursing home data
• Medicare Exclusions Database
– In addition to info on individual docs and other
providers, the database also lists institutions, such as
nursing homes and home health agencies, that have
been barred from Medicare or Medicaid.

• State Boards of Nursing
– Licensure and disciplinary action against nurses

• State Medicaid Fraud Control Units (MFCUs)
– Each state has one in the AG’s office
– Some keep data on prosecutions for abuse, neglect
and theft/exploitation by nursing home staffers
– MFCU contacts in each state:
