Reaching younger
audiences doesn’t mean
shiny & it doesn’t matter
what medium it’s on.

Millennials are more
engaged than ever & they
want quality journalism.

What
matters to
younger
audiences

● Finding themselves in
the data
● Comparisons that
quickly make the point
● Numbers with context
● Digestible language

Using numbers in video
● Anticipate what your audience
will relate to
● What you see on-screen does
not have to match what you
hear in voiceover
● Illustrations that bring your
numbers to light
● Simple graphics

Collaborating with graphics
● Communication is key
● Introductory brainstorm
with the visuals team
● Periodic screenings
● Execute when you know
your key themes
● Establish a workflow

for easy sharing
● Conversational and not
too much text
● Make your point quickly
● Include your logo

People want to see
themselves
(and the people they love)
in the data.
