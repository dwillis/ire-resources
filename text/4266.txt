Welcome to IRE!
If you’re interested in more training from IRE, check out our events and conferences. We do workshops
around the country and two major conferences each year. Our data journalism conference is in the
spring and our annual IRE Conference is held in the summer. We also hold data journalism boot camps
periodically throughout the year. These are intense trainings on using spreadsheets and databases to
analyze electronic records for stories.
We have a number of scholarships and fellowships available to attend these events. We also have
freelance awards to help journalists fund projects. You can find all of that information here:
http://ire.org/events-and-training/fellowships-and-scholarships/
Once your membership is processed you will have access to the following things (some of these don’t
require memberships anyway)


Tipsheets – a database of presentations, handouts, etc. Every time we have a workshop or a
conference speaker materials go in this database. You can search by a topic (“agriculture,”
“immigration,” “education”) or skills (“open records,” “backgrounding,” “Excel”)



Story database – Every year we hold the annual IRE awards. Entries are submitted with a
detailed questionnaire containing information on how the reporters got the story, what records
they used, and advice to others, etc. Use this as a roadmap to conducting a similar investigation.



Listservs – The most active listserv we have is NICAR-L. It is for data journalism and membership
is not required to subscribe. We also have IRE-Plus which is members-only.



IRE Journal – Your membership gives you a subscription to the IRE Journal. In it you’ll find tips,
story ideas and conversations about tough topics.



Blogs, podcasts, webinars, hangouts and conference audio
