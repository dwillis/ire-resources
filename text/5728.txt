Turning an
investigation into
an explainer
A brief explainer on explainers.

Step one: research

Fully understand the
story.
Figure out what you can
show to help others
understand the story.
Find all the different types
of formats and angles a
story could take.

Step two: writing

I start with a visual outline.
Write a two-column script
with visuals on one side and
narration on the other. Fill
out both sides
simultaneously with all the
cool visuals found in
research.
Read it out loud.

Step three: production
[ the part where I can do interviews or shoot
accompanying video elements for animation ]

First draft: how does its sound?

Second draft: get the big animations down

Third draft: make it look good

Tips on distribution...
Use the first 5 - 30 seconds to make a statement.

For both YouTube and Facebook: Never underestimate the power of a good,
visual thumbnail.

Fact-checking your animation
- representations of people need to be accurate (best
case scenario: photos)
- Is the historical representation in the animation
accurate?
- Depictions of culture - does it look plausible?
â†’ To fact-check your visuals, find the most important
expert, who might find flaw with your images

Thank you!
