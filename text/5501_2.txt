a. Everyone is a coder. You’ve done an Excel formula.
b. How many people are terrified they have no competent backup?
2. Main focus (40 minutes, to 12:15)
a. Where you can go wrong before you even get data. Lead: Kristin (to 11:45)

What to ask for
1. Retention schedules are key​ in ​discovering what records an
agency keeps
a. Also helpful to pick out specific terms to describe the
records in a way that will be familiar to the public records
officer.
2. Data dictionary / record layout (​here’s a town budget record
layout​)
a. All the confusing column headers make more sense when
you know what they mean.
b. Have a generic data dictionary handy to email when the
town clerk isn’t sure what you’re looking for
ii.
How to ask for it - FOI OPRA FOIL FOIA
1. Study up:​ Know your state’s open-records laws ​regarding
electronic formats
a. National Freedom of Information Coalition​ site has ​links to
state FOI laws​ and advocates, and sample state request
letters
2. Here’s a ​2016 primer on Federal FOIA​ at everycrsreport.com
3. Prepare:​ Keep Word templates for federal and state records
requests in your Google Drive or Dropbox so the boilerplate is set
and you fill in the details
iii.
How you might want to meld it with stories you’re reporting
1. Start small.

iv.

a. Poke around bls.gov and bea.gov for a factoid or nugget to
beef up your story or add dimension.
2. Try crunching a little data. Just a small spreadsheet. No
complicated formulas. ​Basic math only.
How that process can go astray

b. Pitfalls when hunting for stories. Lead: Alex (to 11:55)

How to spot analysis issues that could derail a story / errors in thinking it
through
1.
c. Cleaning and analysis problems (to 12:05)
i.
Excel
1. Sorting without selecting everything, getting out of sync. Shortcut
key: Control-*, Control-A
2. Rounding off big numbers
3. Not paying attention to what formulas affect. Are you pointing to
the correct row? Correct column?
4. Should you learn a different tool for repeatability?
5. SQL
6. Import routines show warning messages and errors. These are
often not explanatory, but always helpful. Are some of your
columns getting cut short? Are some rows getting dropped
because fields are missing?
7. Did you just get a blank table imported? Check “​lines terminated
by … ignore 1 lines​.” Line endings make sooo much difference.
8. Cross-check lines loaded vs. lines in the file. (​wc -l ​utility is helpful)
9. Select count(somename) as mycount ​is different, painfully
different, from ​select count(*) as mycount​.
d. Avoiding a pre-publication dumpster fire that could erode your credibility. Lead:

3. Have you spot-checked to see if your row-level data is still in sync
with the original file?
