Does north always have to be at the top of maps? Do timelines always have to run left-to-right? Spurred
by the needs of responsive design, many newsrooms have been experimenting with unconventional
orientations for data visualisations. This panel will explore how standards and conventions are just
standards and conventions, when and why to break them — and when not.
Conference page​ | ​Slide deck
Other ways of phrasing the problem to be discussed:
●
●
●
●

Creating visual narrative or hierarchy in graphics that doesn't necessarily support a left-to-right or
top-to-bottom flow.
the ways standards and conventions are just standards and conventions... but sometimes they
are for a reason. How we succeeded and failed trying to break them, when to do it and when not.
how data visualisations can be transformed by the new devices and the new reading movement
they force us to follow.
how to fit a better quantity and quality of information in ‘just’ 640px width having mobile and small
size devices in mind.

Intro

●

●

Some common data viz and interface conventions:
○ north=up
○ “higher”=”more” (eg extruded 3d maps)
○ “darker”=”more” eg in choropleths
○ Time scrubber moves left to right (in animation/video)
○ x/y is horizontal/vertical in 2d space
Why are we talking about this now?
○ Mobile forcing design rethinks:
■ Small, multiple-viewport, portrait-shaped aspect ratio (vs print/desktop)
■ swipe as the dominant UI action
What will we talk about:
○ Maps
○ Charts
○ User interfaces
Fighting “xenographphobia” (ie pro-conventional design bias)
○ Among editors and other colleagues
■ Highlight that usual chart types are well-established elsewhere
○ Among readers
■ Long history: eg ​1849 line chart
■ Annotate to educate (eg ​Chord diagram at FT​)

Maps
(Armand)
The most straightforward interpretation of “North is not ‘North’”
1. Rotating common perspectives
2. Scrolling along paths
3. Mapping in 3D
4. Counterpoint: Allowing user orientation. When is that work needed by user that payoff
worthwhile. (​xenographobia​)

Rotating common perspectives
Washington Post ​election results from coast to coast
New York Times ​responsive map of Crossrail in London​ (mobile)

Unusual/uncommon map projections
Bloomberg artic circle ​https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2017-arctic/the-economic-arctic/#2045

Scrolling along paths
Washington Post ​mapping the eclipse
IB Times: ​Trans-siberian railway

X, Y and Z-coordinates - mapping in 3D
L.A. Times: ​The Thomas Fire: 40 days of devastation
Washington Post: ​Mapping the DMZ

Allowing the user to freely explore a map
L.A. Times: ​Discovering Gale Crater

Provides an original perspective, but is it worth confusing the user?
Several Londoners definitely did not like this and were forceful saying so on social media. The Thames
running east-west is apparently an important ​point of orientation​.
What are best practices here?
Bridging the graphics language gap?

BBC example (of editors’ xenographobia) — how to sell the unconventional approach to the wider
newsroom. Good opportunity to ask for audience input:

Re-oriented story forms / user experience

Not so much the orientation of the graphic, but how the reader proceeds through the experience

Study that shows when it is is good to subvert conventions
When to push boundaries?
- UI/UX - what is the contemporary convention? people know to scroll now. what is the next convention?
- does it mimic real-life examples?

History up the north=up convention

Al Jazeera: ​How the north ended up top of the world
BBC Future (2016): ​Maps have north at the top, but it could have been different
Great ​thread from Le Monde cartographer Jules Grandin​:
● Ptolemy north=up map (150AD)
● orbis terrarum (“​T and O map”) eg ​Mappa Mundi (700s-1300s)​ (see also ​Wikipedia​)
○ But Islamic maps of the era were south-up, eg Muhammad Al Idrissi’s map ​Tabula
Rogeriana​ from 1154
● National Geographic: ​Bizarre, Enormous 16th-Century Map Assembled for First Time
● 1569 Mercator map establishes convention
● Blue Marble​ (1972)
● Peters Projection (1973)
● McArthur's Universal Corrective Map of the World​ (1979) and other ​upside-down maps
