BE THE BEST
My job is to do what I can to allow everyone to do their very best work

PLAN, PLAN AND THEN PLAN SOME MORE
Don’t leave anything to chance, talk to death every undercover, interview, shoot and
confrontation. Talk to death the focus of the story early and often.

MANAGE UP, DOWN AND OVER
Be the devil’s advocate with your team—but be their biggest advocate with everyone
else (inside and outside of the newsroom)

EDIT EVERYTHIGN
Don’t stop with “reading the script”. Edit it, look for good structure, know the vision
and then watch the “a” roll to make sure it sounds as good as it looked on paper.

FOCUS
Keep the focus when no one else does. Focus the story, the meeting, the research, the
daily and long-term goals.

HOLD ‘EM ACCOUNTABLE
Make sure you hold your team to the same standards they hold the subjects of their
stories.

TELL THEM THEY’RE GREAT, AND THEN TELL THEM THEY ARE GREAT 10
MORE TIMES
Always reward your team when they’ve done great work. Reward the behavior you
want to see. There is never enough!

HAVE FUN!
Never forget we have the best jobs in television news, ENJOY THE RIDE!
