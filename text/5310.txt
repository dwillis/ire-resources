Searchable Chart of 30+ Tools
30+ Free Tools for Data Visualization & Analysis includes ratings of tools from
easy to advanced. http://cwrld.us/FreeDataTools

Keeping Track of Information
VisualPing is a cloud service and Chrome extension. For free, the cloud service will
only check two different Web pages once a day, emailing you if there are changes
based on triggers you set up. The VisualPing Chrome Extension will check pages as
often as once a minute. The drawback is that you only get notified in your browser
when the computer is on and Chrome is running. https://visualping.io/
Klaxon is a free, open-source tool from the Marshall Project, a non-profit covering
criminal justice issues. Like VisualPing, it monitors changes in Web pages – but
itâ€™s an application that you need to deploy yourself on a cloud service. Marshall
Project has pretty detailed instructions on how to deploy this to Heroku. Herouku has
a free account, which Marshall Project says should let you send around 12,000
emails a month, store 10,000 change, run 18 hours a day, and check each watched
site every 10 minutes. The first level of paid service is about $10/month for more
email and $9/month for a lot more database storage. Thereâ€™s also an option to
post alerts into a Slack channel. https://newsklaxon.org
Google News Alerts. Head to https://www.google.com/alerts to set up news alerts
for search terms of your choice.
Sqoop lets you set up alerts by search topics for U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission filings, patents, some U.S. federal courts, and a few more sources. A

paid service for most users, they will give free accounts to working
journalists. https://sqoop.com
Tweetdeck can be more useful for monitoring Twitter if you use filters as well as
lists. https://tweetdeck.twitter.com
Evernote is helpful for saving information, especially from the Web with the Chrome
browser extension. Another alternative is Microsoft
OneNote. https://evernote.com and https://www.onenote.com/
IFTTT and Zapier are services that let you do some programming without writing
code, if you want something to happen based on some sort of trigger. For example, I
use Zapier to send any Slack message I star to Evernote to be
saved. https://ifttt.com and https://zapier.com

Data Format Issues
Cometdocs is a great tool for extracting data from PDFs into Excel or Word files,
especially if that data first started its life as an Excel or Word document and was
then saved as a PDF. https://www.cometdocs.com
Table Capture Chrome extension. Useful for extracting and saving information
from HTML Web tables. Search for it in the Chrome extension store. More
info: https://www.georgemike.com/tablecapture/test/

Web Scraping Without Code
More information in Samantha Sunne’s IRE presentation
at http://bit.ly/ScrapeNoCode
I don’t use the services below, since I write code for Web scraping, but one of these
might be useful if you don’t program:

[**Import.io]**(https://www.import.io/)
OutwitHub
Data Scraper from DataMiner
Morph.io (formerly ScraperWiki, now QuickCode)

I tested Data Scraper, and it was a worthwhile option if you’ve got well-formated
HTML.

Data Wrangling & Preparation
Open Refine is designed to help you wrangle your data. It has clustering that lets
you choose different algorithms to try to find similar names (for companies, cities,

etc.). You can also do some data exploration in Refine. Free and open source, runs
locally in your browser. http://openrefine.org
Google Cloud Dataprep Google’s cloud version of a data-wrangling service from
Trifacta. Will be some (likely small) cost; credit card
required. https://cloud.google.com/dataprep
Trifacta local desktop version of Google Cloud’s Dataprep, still requires an online
account and there are some limits to the free version. https://www.trifacta.com

Data Visualization and Analysis
Check out my searchable, sortable chart of 30+ free tools for data visualization
and analysis, ranked by skill level needed from 1 (fairly easy) to 4 (you might want
to be a programmer to use). http://cwrld.us/FreeDataTools
Google Fusion Tables
**Chartbuilder I really love this open-source app and free service for making
publication-quality charts and graphs in a couple of minutes. It generates static
image charts only, not interactive JavaScript Web
charts. http://quartz.github.io/Chartbuilder
Datawrapper is a little more robust than Chartbuilder, but also a bit more complex to
use (although not much). It’s not free for more than 10,000
views/month. https://www.datawrapper.de
Plotly can create interactive JavaScript Web visualizations as well as static charts.
Free account is limited to 25 charts. Interface is somewhat more complicated still,
but you can do some basic statistical analysis as well as visualizations for
publication. There are open-source versions as libraries for Python and
R. https://plot.ly
Tableau Public popular and extremely powerful software for data visualization and
analysis. Definitely has a learning curve. Free version requires charts and data to be
public. https://public.tableau.com

R Programming Language
Technically the R Project for Statistical Computing, this is a great language for data
analysis and visualization if you want to learn to program.
