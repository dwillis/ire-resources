Transparency in Investigative Jouralism: Lorie Hearn, Shawn
McIntosh, Charles Ornstein

In an era when “Fake News” is part of the everyday
lexicon and readers question the credibility of our
work, transparency matters. This panel will explore
practices that can build trust with readers, such as
annotating stories; publishing source documents;
revealing our funding sources and being up front with
story subjects about what we’re investigating. We’ll
explore tricky issues like how much to say about an
investigation before it publishes and how to respond
to concerns about accuracy and bias.

TRANSPARIFY
While most online news sources insert hyperlinks
in their stories, inewsource was the
first in the country to achieve this level of
transparency in 2013.
Six years later and – as far as we know –
we’re still the only newsroom that does it.
