NICAR ’14: Getting Started With Python
1 Comment

For a hands-on intro to Python at IRE’s 2014 NICAR conference, I put together a Github
repo with code snippets just for beginners.
Find it here: https://github.com/anthonydb/python-get-started
For more Python snippets I’ve found useful, see:
https://github.com/anthonydb/python-snippets
Finally, if you’d like an even deeper dive, check out journalist-coder Tom Meagher’s
repository for the Python mini bootcamp held at this year’s conference.
Thanks to everyone who showed up!
