The main reasons you will get for denials or delays:
● Federal FOIA exemptions​: national security, internal agency rules, data/info exempt
under other laws, trade secrets, internal agency memos, ​personal privacy [(b)(6)]​, law
enforcement, banks, oil/gas wells
● State FOI exemptions​: frequently echo federal exemptions, with additions.
● Delay tactics​: absurd cost estimates, sending incorrect data, “unclear” request.
● HIPAA​ - Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
● FERPA​ - Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act
If you are dealing with health or education data, you will frequently run into issues with privacy
and restricted data (federal FOIA exemption (b)(6), HIPAA, FERPA).
Some tips before you request your data from an agency (federal, state or local):
●
Research before you request:​ find out if the data exists before you request it.
○
Schemas, data dictionaries, repository of restricted/limited use data, emails
referring to contract data projects, state reporting requirements.
●
Be friendly before you file:​ Call the department/agency/school/hospital and explain
what you want and ask if the data is public vs limited use. Familiarize yourself with the
language.
●
Find the internal data wizard:​ Try to speak with the data custodian (explain that you
are just attempting to understand what data is available and how it is stored).
●
Ask before you request:​ Try the “I don’t want to waste your time” argument.
●
Always request an itemized cost estimate.​ Never trust an estimate, calculate your
own.
●
Negotiations are crucial​: Note that you are willing to negotiate the scope of your
request to avoid privacy restrictions.
●
KNOW THE PRIVACY RESTRICTIONS​: HIPAA, FERPA, B6
●
Know the AG decisions​: ​If you’re dealing with a particularly difficult request, look at the
state AG decisions around the privacy issue that you’re circumventing.
There is a difference between exemption 6 and HIPAA:
● Exemption 6:
○ “Exemption 6 protects information about individuals in ‘personnel and medical
files and similar files’ when the disclosure of such information ‘would constitute a
clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy’....On the other hand, if a
privacy interest is found to exist, the public interest in disclosure, if any, must be
weighed against the privacy interest in nondisclosure. If no public interest exists,
the information should be protected; as the D.C. Circuit has observed,
‘something, even a modest privacy interest, outweighs nothing every time.’ If

●

there is a public interest in disclosure that outweighs the privacy interest, the
information should be disclosed; if the opposite is found to be the case, the
information should be withheld.” - DOJ Guide to FOIA, ​Source
○ “The Supreme Court has reviewed the application of this exemption. It noted:
First, in evaluating whether a request for information lies within the scope of a
FOIA exemption, such as Exemption 6, that bars disclosure when it would
amount to an invasion of privacy that is to some degree ‘unwarranted,’ a court
must balance the public interest in disclosure against the interest Congress
intended the exemption to protect.” -- Department of Defense v. F.L.R.A., 114
S.Ct. 1006, 1012 (1994)
○ If you get this denial and decide to sue for records, the courts will do some kind
of “balancing test” where they assess:
● The plaintiffs’ interest in disclosure.
● The public interest in disclosure.
● The degree of invasion of personal privacy.
● The availability of any alternate means of obtaining the requested
information.
HIPAA does not require information officers to consider any kind of test when deciding
whether they will release a record.

HEALTH DATA
So what is HIPAA:
●
Started in 1996, to support a bill related to health insurance portability.
●
Included language to increase use of e-records so that medical records could quickly be
transferred from one entity to the next.
●
Congress realized that there would need to be some assurance of privacy protection for
sensitive medical information, but they couldn’t get their act together in time, so HHS
created HIPAA, which went into effect in 2003.
●
HIPAA applies to:
○
Health care organizations (providers, health plans, public health agencies, life
insurers, billing agencies, ambulance services, and universities).
○
Any organization that electronically bills/transmits health care data.
○
Hybrid entities (for example: schools, prisons, detention facilities).
●
HIPAA is forever, well almost: when you die, this privacy protection lives on for 50 years;
control passes to a family member or executor.
●
HIPAA leaves it up to the health care professional to redact the records to make them
releasable.
When personal information combines with health information, it becomes protected. There are
18 main categories of variables that are ​“personally identifiable”:
●
Name, Address (subdivisions smaller than a state), Birth, death, admission and
discharge dates, Telephone and fax numbers, email addresses, Social Security

numbers, Medical record numbers, Health plan numbers, Account number,
License number, Vehicle serial number, Web URL, IP addresses, Finger/voice
print, Photographic images, Any other characteristic that could uniquely identify a
person.
Even with HIPAA, you can still get data:
●
Hospital Directory Data: ​basic facts about current/recent patients at hospitals.
○
Patient names.
○
Locations within hospital.
○
General conditions (if a patient has been treated, died).
○
Room/telephone numbers.
●
Statistical data on hospital billing: ​hospitals/state agencies/federal government can
release this information.
●
Medical Examiner Data: ​HIPAA does not limit your ability to get data from medical
examiners or coroners offices.
●
Ambulance or emergency medical services: ​under state laws, some of the medical
information might be limited, but you might be able to get non-medical data.
●
People are entitled to their OWN records​ (although this doesn’t really help you get
datasets).
DE-IDENTIFIED DATA:
If data has been “de-identified,” HIPAA doesn’t apply, as long as there is “no reasonable basis
to believe that the information can be used to identify an individual.”
●
“Safe Harbor” method = field suppression.
●
“Expert determination” method = verify that there is a “very small” risk of re-identification.
Some tips:
● Often this data is online: ​This kind of data, which is frequently publicly available online,
can be incredibly useful for reporting.
● Ask to remove personally identifiable variables:
●
If the data you want includes any of the 18 personal identifiers, try to request the
data without the identifiers (redacted or removed).
●
Ask for dummy IDs (but make sure you which variables are the dummy
variables).
● Ask for aggregate data:
●
This may count as “creating” new data and therefore, the FOIA or records officer
may say that they cannot do this. Ask nicely, and negotiate! But remember, they
are likely not required to give you data.
●
If you are able to get aggregate data (or you get data that you can only publish in
aggregate), you may have to limit your data set based on cell size to protect
privacy of patients.
LIMITED-USE DATA SETS:

How to request a limited-use data set:
●
Make sure the data exists.
●
Ask if the data might be available if you sign a data use agreement.
●
Review any data use agreement with an attorney (or your newsroom’s counsel).
●
Keep track of dates of use and publishing restrictions.
●
Keep track of data and agreement updates.
Frequent elements in a data use agreement:
●
Statement of intent:​ who you are, emphasis/plan of study, goals.
●
Justification of access:​ says that the agreement is authorized under HIPAA.
●
Description of data​: what data you are using.
●
Payment:​ this is normally a set amount.
●
Uses and disclosures:​ how the data can be used and what needs to be
included in your story related to source of data.
●
Disposition of data:​ how long can you have the data for.
●
List of all reporters:​ include a list of everyone working on the data, including all
people you think might want to work on the data.

Education data:
Some examples of what kind of data you might request :
●
Databases of contracts (or the contracts themselves).
●
Student achievement data (test scores, grades, graduation and remediation rates).
●
Databases related to school financial records (teacher/employee salaries, overtime pay,
expense data sets).
●
Data related to teachers (teacher pay, experience, turnover, discipline, performance
evaluations).
●
Data related to school discipline (suspensions, expulsions, arrests, DAEP transfers).
●
Federal surveys
●
Data related to admissions and student loans.

FERPA:
●
Started in 1974, this law protects privacy of student educational records, limiting their
disclosure (but it also allows students and their families to access their own records).
●
Federal funds will be withheld if schools have a “policy or practice of permitting the
release of education records (or personally identifiable information contained therein
other than directory information ...).”
●
Because nearly every public school, college and university receive public funds, FERPA
applies to almost every educational institution in the country.

●
●

Personally identifiable information: student or parent names, addresses, SSN, biometric
records, place and date of birth.
FERPA, like HIPAA, may be misused by institutions to protect institutions from scrutiny.

DIRECTORY DATA:
●
Any information in an education record of a student that would not “generally be
considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed.”
●
Typically, it includes: name, address, telephone listing, email, photo, date/place of birth,
participation in activities/sports, dates of attendance, major field of study, grade level,
enrollment status (part- or full-time), weight and height of athletes, degrees, honors or
awards, most recent ed institution attended.
●
Schools can disclose this information to third parties (us) if it has given public notice of
the types of information it has designated “directory information.”
●
Parents can opt out.
Even with FERPA you can get data:
●
Instructional data: Records related to teaching and administrative roles (that are in the
sole possession of the maker of the records) are not considered “education records.”
●
Law enforcement/Campus security data: School police units are not part of “education
records.” That being said, if records are created by a school law enforcement unit for
non-law enforcement purposes (no arrest, no charges, etc…), they may be subject to
restrictions. Note: with juvenile crimes, states have varying privacy laws.
●
Health/emergency records: Institutions may release records without student/parent
permission if it’s necessary to safeguard a student’s health/safety.
●
School employment data: Unless the employee is a student is at a school.
●
Scholarship and award data: Because it can be considered part of directory data, this
information may not be subject to FERPA restrictions. Reporters in some states have
fought to get this data released.
●
Spending/contracting data: For the most part, not covered by FERPA.
With FERPA you can also get de-identified data.​ If the data is aggregated or the
personally-identifiable characteristics have been removed, you may be able get data. Similar to
health data sets, you may be able to request restricted-use data from a federal, state or local
educational agency. For example, the education department has these data sets available:
