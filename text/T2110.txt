Rule Number 1: Follow the path of least resistance – the budget. Always have your radar up
for language in budgets that provide for a specific vendor to win or keep a contract outside of the
competitive process.
Rule Number 2: Know the procurement rules and which rules were followed or ignored.
•
•
•
•
•

Read the statute, code or enabling law
Read any rules adopted by the governing body that is authorizing the contract
Find where the spending for the contract is authorized in the budget -- this is a back-ended
way of finding if the contractor has received special favor
Know the difference between a contract awarded under an RFP and RFQ or invitation to
bid
Find out if the agency has a list of pre-qualified contractors – if vendor is not on the list,
why? If it is, is it favored? Why?

Rule Number 3: Look beyond the obvious – check out minority contractors
•

•

Do they hire consultants?
Do they transfer money in and out of the organization?
Does the non-profit have a foundation where income may be held outside of IRS
disclosure statements
Does the non-profit have a 527?
Check IRS: Form 990s, Form 1023 and 1024
Use Guidestar to get 990s online

Rule Number 4: Connect the dots between political contributors and contract vendors
•
•

•

Check corporate filing information: does the vendors’ top officials, board of directors,
lobbyists have links to the agency or public officials awarding the contract?
Who is the contractor: search the SEC web site
(http://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/webusers.htm)
* prospectus -- the information to shareholders may mention government work;
what percentage of their work is it, how dependent are they on the contract?
* annual report – read the footnotes.
* proxy – list names, salary and benefits of top employees
Check names and personnel lists of the vendor. Have any on staff held government jobs or
worked at the agency before (often a contractor will hire the agency official just prior to or
after acquiring a contract.)

Random questions to ask:
•
•
•
•
•

Is the bulk purchase being divided to avoid competitive bids?
What’s the agency getting? Does it need it or are the goods and services going unused?
How important to the company is this contract – read the SEC documents, search for press
releases on PRnewswire, etc.
Will this contract displace union workers? If so, talk to the union.
What history has this company had with this agency? Read post-contract audits about a
vendor, change orders from previous contracts, etc. They can alert you to problems with
the contractor or discrepancies in the process
