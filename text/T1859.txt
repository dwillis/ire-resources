Just forget about census data. Ask yourself, “What data do I need for this story?” Then go find it. Eventually,
investigative stories often require looking at patterns in how something is distributed: teachers, crashes, hip replacements,
whatever. The patterns may be numerical, but they can also be spatial – the “where.” In either case, that’s when you often
need census data because it not only counts (almost) everyone, it tells you where they live or work as well. Here are just a
few areas where you can use data from the census to tackle more complicated questions and investigations.
Segregation and diversity
One Web site that features lots of analyses and data from Census 2000 is the Mumford Center at the University at
Albany, http://mumford1.dyndns.org/cen2000/report.html. Director John Logan has also assembled news coverage of
these reports and other segregation analyses that have sprung from Census 2000. Another is the Brookings Institution’s
Center on Urban and Metropolitan Policy, http://www.brookings.edu/es/urban/urban.htm. Yet another is the Civil Rights
Project at Harvard University, http://www.civilrightsproject.harvard.edu/.
Diversity is a different concept, except at very local levels like a neighborhood or block. It tells you . One example is
the USA TODAY Diversity Index, invented in 1991 to analyze the 1990 Census by Phil Meyer and Shawn McIntosh. It
measures the chance that two people from a given area are different races or ethnicities. It varies from 0 to 100, can be
used for big or small areas and allows comparisons of places and times. Updated to handle multi-race data from Census
2000, it’s explained at http://www.unc.edu/~pmeyer/carstat/tools.html.
One more note: Diversity isn’t just about race. You might want to explore other kinds of local diversity: age, education,
economic activity, rootedness, etc.
Income inequality/disparity
There’s a rich literature and debate on this subject, especially among labor economists. It heated up in the mid-1970s,
when U.S. Gini index – the standard gauge – started rising after having fallen steadily since World War II
(http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/img/p60-191.pdf and http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/DistributionofIncome.html).
Much debate ensued about whether the shift was real or created by demographic trends like smaller households. That
pretty much ended in 1992, when a landmark paper by Frank Levy and Richard Murnane summarized and analyzed
studies from the previous 15 years. After that, debate largely shifted to the trend’s possible causes and importance. Some
economists still don’t think it’s real because standard data doesn’t include income-like subsidies. They also point out that
as long as people can move up and down the ladder, it doesn’t matter that much how far apart the rungs get to be.
Sociologists counter that those larger gaps can translate to growing social distance and weakened communities.
At any rate, U.S. income inequality actually stopped growing for much of the 1990s, as benefits of the booming
economy flowed to much of the middle class. It began edging up in the recession that began in 2000. See
http://www.census.gov/hhes/income/income01/prs02asc.html.
In recent years a new debate arose when a few public health studies showed a link between income inequality and life
expectancy. In other words, regardless of your income, you die sooner in places where there’s more income inequality.
Several recent studies have knocked down the earlier work (http://bmj.com/cgi/content/full/324/7328/1), but
epidemiologists are still chewing on the data, methods and possible reasons.
For reports and data that journalists can understand, check out the Census Bureau’s work
(http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/p60204.html), the University of Texas Inequality Project (http://utip.gov.utexas.edu/),
the World Bank (http://www.worldbank.org/poverty/inequal/index.htm), Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government
Inequality Project (http://www.ksg.harvard.edu/inequality/) and a multi-country collaboration of researchers called the

Luxembourg Income Study (http://www.lisproject.org/). For scattered Federal Reserve Board documents, including
Chairman Alan Greenspan’s views, see his 1998 speech opening a conference on the topic. It’s the top link in this Google
search: “income inequality” site:federalreserve.gov.
Employment discrimination
One of the last Census 2000 files is designed specifically to look at employment equity. It’s called the Special EEO
File. It is scheduled to be published this fall. The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission heads a federal
consortium paying the Census Bureau for this special retallying of Census 2000 data. For metros, cities and large counties,
it will break down by scores of industries (food manufacturing, real estate, museums, etc.) and hundreds of occupations
(truck driver, sales clerk, food handler, etc.) the number of workers by sex and race. Some tables will break this down by
education, age and earnings as well. It will be used to judge policies and social programs on hiring, promotion and
compensation for the next decade. It will be a gold mine for researchers and journalists who want to look at:
-- Affirmative action and its effects under various industry schemes, state laws and labor market conditions.
-- Glass ceilings in the overall or specific industries, occupations and even labor unions.
-- Pay equity in various occupations, industries and geographical areas.
-- Daytime diversity for various areas and occupations, because the data will be tallied not just by place of residence
but also by place of work.
-- Age discrimination in various industries, occupations and locales.
To read up on the Special EEO File, start at http://www.eeoc.gov/stats/census/plans.html or
http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/eeoindex.html. See the table breakdown: http://www.eeoc.gov/stats/census/tables.html.
You can dial up some answers from the 1990 file (http://censtats.census.gov/eeo/eeo.shtml) or buy it for $75
(http://www.census.gov/mp/www/rom/msrom6d.html).
Health care planning and delivery
The U.S. health care system is so riddled with disparities, contradictions, inefficiencies, fraud and waste that it’s ripe
picking for investigative journalists. Calling it a “system” is a misnomer because it’s a loosely linked set of delivery
systems that evolved separately – employer-based health insurance for workers and retirees, disability and Social Security
benefits, Medicare, Medicaid, military health care, etc. Some data spun off by these systems can be analyzed without
baseline demographic data. One excellent example is the Dartmouth Atlas on Health Care. See
http://www.dartmouthatlas.org/. Director John Wennberg pulls together researchers to study how health care resources are
overused, underused and misused. Extensive charts and maps show striking patterns. State- and metro-level reports are
available, and you can also download some data.
A good clearinghouse is the National Association of Health Data Organizations. Its list of members’ Web sites,
http://www.nahdo.org/membersites.asp, is a great place browse for reports and data tools from government and non-profit
agencies. Look at states besides your own for ideas and examples of what to seek in your state.
Baseline data the way you want it
School districts
You might think that the best data on local schoolchildren comes from the public school district, but it may or may not
include kids in home schooling, private schools or charter schools. It also doesn’t include dropouts. The National Center
for Education Statistics has tallied some Census 2000 data on all kids living within the boundaries of a local and regional
school district. The result is handy Web-accessible profiles (http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/sdds/c2000d.asp) or downloadable
data for every school district in the nation. NCES has also compiled neighborhood-level data from the census long form in
the School District Tabulation (STP2): http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/sdds/tablemain.asp. Future releases will create
separate profiles for various groups in each district -- all households or just those with children or just children

themselves.
City-suburb profiles
HUD has built Census 2000 data into a Web tool that lets you build simple comparative profiles from the censuses of
1970, 1980, 1990 and 2000 for any metro, one of its central cities or suburbs and the balance of the metro’s suburbs
(http://socds.huduser.org/Census/Census_Home.htm?) You can also download the data.
