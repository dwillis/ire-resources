What is data and what can we do with
it?

DATA STORYTELLING
▪ Give context, even for breaking news.
▪ Uncover basic information and background sources.
▪ Quantify AND anecdote: find patterns, systemic issues

How many times have you seen this on
television?

We can do better!

What are our choices?
● Show the data or
documents
● Show the reporter going
through the documents
● Find another way to
visualize the data

Some of the best data stories don’t
look like data stories at all...at first.

Steps to the story
★ Requested sentencing data
★ Cleaned and analyzed data
★ Pulled records at the courthouse
★ Found one case he wanted to highlight first. The key that
turned this report into a story with a powerful narrative.

2. TOOLS
To analyze raw data and turn it into
visualizations

The data viz equivalent of
pointing to a document

ONLINE PRESENTATION: DATA
▪ DataWrapper: (freemium) easier to use
Free version: 10,000 charts a month
1 locator map per month

ONLINE PRESENTATION: DATA
▪ DataWrapper River: Free charts

▪ DataWrapper River: Free charts

ONLINE PRESENTATION: DATA
▪ Tableau Public: (or Desktop, free to IRE members)
sophisticated visualizations with no programming
necessary (example)
▪ Awesome-table: interactive lookup tool
▪ Flourish: high-level charts and graphs

Example of Flourish template turned into a gif

ONLINE PRESENTATION: DATA (cont.)
▪ TimelineJS: convert a spreadsheet into an interactive
timeline
▪ StoryMapJS: create interactive maps that tell a story.
(example)
▪ DocumentCloud: uploading, annotating, analyzing and
embedding documents

3. TIPS
What makes a good visualization?

KEEP IT SIMPLE
Audiences need to get the most
information out of it as quickly
as possible.
▪
▪
▪
▪

Bar charts (comparison)
Line charts (changes over
time)
Maps (geographic data)
Searchable tables (to show
all data)

MAKE IT INTERACTIVE
People want to see what’s
happening in their
neighborhood, school, etc.
▪
▪
▪
▪

Searchable maps
Searchable, sortable tables
Clickable elements
Ask audience to help
explore

FIND UNIQUE DATASETS
You’ll get the most mileage
from data and interactives that
your audience can’t find or
easily access anywhere else.
▪
▪
▪

Public salaries
Local campaign finance
Restaurant inspections

PROVIDE VALUABLE INFORMATION
Especially in a breaking news or
emergency situation, you can
establish your organization as
the go-to resource for reliable,
valuable information.
▪
▪
▪

Flooded roads
Crime maps
Unstable infrastructure
(bridges, dams, etc)

MAKE SURE IT’S
MOBILE
Place your screenshot here

Remember much of your
audience will view your viz
on a phone or tablet.

KEEP IT UPDATED
If a dataset is released regularly,
and you’re getting good
interest, sustain traffic by
updating your visualization.
▪
▪
▪

Murder maps
Restaurant inspections
Campaign finance

BULLETPROOF YOUR DATA
Watch out for dirty data
(misspellings, duplicates,
missing data, etc) and make
sure your analysis is sound.
▪
▪

Run integrity checks
Clean data using
OpenRefine or other tools

4. DATA SOURCES
Finding data online and through records
requests

WAYS TO FIND DATA
▪

Record retention schedules (example: Washington)

▪

Open data portals (example: Seattle)

▪

Online sleuthing (Google using filetype:xlsx)

▪

Good old-fashioned beat reporting & sourcing

▪

Federal FOIA/state public records laws

▪

Build your own database
