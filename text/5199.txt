BUYING INTO THE MYTH OF SCARCITY
WE MUST CUT SPENDING BECAUSE WE
DON’T HAVE ENOUGH TAX REVENUE

GOVERNMENT SPENDING

WE CAN’T PURCHASE WHAT WE NEED
FROM LOCAL BUSINESS
WE NEED MORE TAX BREAKS
TO ATTRACT BUSINESS

BETTER ECONOMY
BETTER JOBS
BETTER INFRASTRUCTURE
BETTER TAX BASE

WE NEED TO USE REVENUE INTENDED FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE JUST TO PLUG
THE HOLES IN BASIC BUDGETS

CHALLENGING THE MYTH OF SCARCITY
MONEY ON THE SIDELINES:
MONEY WE ALREADY HAVE BUT
ARE NOT SPENDING

GOVERNMENT SPENDING
INVESTMENT

TRICKLE OUT ECONOMICS:
MONEY WE ARE SPENDING,
BUT NOT IN NEW MEXICO
SWISS CHEESE TAX POLICY:
MONEY WE GIVE AWAY BEFORE WE EVER
SEE IT
DEDICATED FUND BAIT & SWITCH:
MONEY WE ARE SPENDING, BUT NOT THE
WAY IT WAS INTENDED

BETTER ECONOMY
BETTER JOBS
BETTER INFRASTRUCTURE
BETTER TAX BASE

LOCAL TAX BREAKS: THE MISSING PIECE
Intel: $2.6 billion in state and local
incentives since 1993 and 4 M gpd water
Eclipse Aviation: $100M IRB in 2000
Schott Solar: Approved for $125 million
IRB + $15.9 million dollar grant in 2008
+ $1.5 million job training

LOCAL TAX BREAKS: THE MISSING PIECE
Some initial observations:
• “We’ve never been in the same room before”
 Who is at the table when we package corporate giveaways?
• “We don’t track this”
 Why not?
• “That’s confidential”
 Why aren’t we asking the recipients of corporate giveaways

to waive those protections?

FREE STUFF FOR BILLIONAIRES!
Facebook Data Center received:
• $30 billion in industrial revenue bonds
• $10 million cash
• 1.5 million gallons of water per day
• Local tax reimbursement of $1.6 million /

TAX EXPENDITURES
EITHER FORCE
BUDGETS REDUCTIONS
OR INFLATE REMAINING
TAX RATES

MEANWHILE, AT THE BEGGAR’S TABLE
$10 million = End the rape kit backlog
$19 million = plug a county tax hole instead
of cutting 1% from county employee pay
$68 million = Pay for full tuition under
Lottery Scholarship; instead we are cutting to
60% coverage
