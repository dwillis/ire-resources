The National Indian Gaming Commission is charged with monitoring
contracts tribal gaming authorities make with outside firms and individuals
who run tribal gaming facilities. The process is long and ponderous and
some developers want to sidestep it for legitimate purposes. In some cases
they simply do not want to tie up time and money while a government
bureaucrats go through the paperwork. Developers don't like uncertainty.
And sometimes NIGC will tell the developers to renegotiate the deal.
Unscrupulous developers hate management contracts for another reason it
subjects them to background checks by NIGC.
So, to get around NIGC, developers and tribes often negotiate
consulting agreements. Technically, the tribe runs the gaming operation and
the developer is a consultant. Over the last three years, NIGC has come up
with a new way to deal with this loophole. It maintains that any consulting
agreement that provides a substantial share of revenue to an outside party
violates a provision of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act that says tribes
should have the "sole proprietary interest" in their gaming operations. In
other words, if the deal gives the outsider much more money than the tribe,
the outsider has illegally assumed the role of owner. Here's the problem:
NIGC is fighting a loophole with a gray area it has not formulated clear
standards to determine when an outsider has assumed the "sole proprietary
interest" in a gambling operation.
