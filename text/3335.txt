Ten Tips for Effective Interviews
#1 – Go.
Don’t rely on the telephone and avoid email questions. Find a place where the subject feels
comfortable. Home, favorite restaurant, let them choose.
#2 – Be prepared.
Sounds fundamental but sometimes not. Research the subject’s background. Make notes to yourself
on specific topics/questions you need to cover.
#3 – Be transparent.
Explain what you hope to achieve with the interview. Be clear about terms (on record or not).
#4 – Be understanding.
If the subject seems nervous, put away the notepad/tape recorder and try to make them relax. Bring it
out again when they are ready.
#5 – Use tape whenever possible.
A tape recorder gives you the ability to capture the nuance of the subject’s storytelling. The level of
detail will improve your writing and reporting.
#6 – Structure your questions to elicit full responses.
Questions that elicit only a yes or no do an interviewer a disservice. Think about how you word
questions to get the fullest responses. The goal is storytelling.
#7 – Be persistent.
You go into an interview needing key questions fully answered. Don’t be afraid to come back to a
question until it is answered satisfactorily. Reword, rethink your approach. Keep trying.
#8 ‐ Shut up and listen.
Don’t be so afraid of awkward silences that you chatter endlessly. The subject should be the star.
# 9 ‐ Chronology is your friend.
In an interview, as in storytelling. Guide the subject. “What happened next?”
#10 – No question is too stupid.
Don’t assume anything.
