TIPS ON FOLLOWING THE MONEY
from Mark Lagerkvist
If you want to catch a scoundrel, think like a scoundrel.
Put yourself in the shoes of a self-interested public official.
How would you game the system to serve yourself, your ambitions and your cronies?
Think about perks, expense accounts, pensions, double dips and other sweetheart deals.
As a scoundrel, what trail would you leave behind in public records?
Consider the various checks, vouchers, ledgers, memos and other documents that must exist.
It should tell you, as a journalist, what records you should request.
Start digging – and don’t hesitate to make public records requests
Be smart, be aggressive and don’t back down.
If your requests are unreasonably denied, write stories about the lack of transparency.
Even scoundrels don’t like to be exposed or embarrassed in public.
