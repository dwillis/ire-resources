Major sources of federal health care data:
CMS
FDA
CDC
AHRQ
MACPAC

Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
Food and Drug Administration
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission

What kinds of questions can
you answer?

Which doctors billed Medicare for over $1
million in urine tests in a single year?
Over 50 individual
doctors and clinics were
paid over $1 million for
urine drug tests in 2014.
CMS Provider billing data (FFS)

How much did the drug price increase for
specific generic drugs cost Medicaid?
A 40 cent increase in a year for a single drug meant Medicaid
paid $54 million more than it did the year before

CMS Drug Spending Data, 2015

Which nursing homes have problems
controlling infections?

CMS, Nursing Home Compare

Which hospitals has CMS penalized for
patient injuries?

There are many caveats. Some examples...
If you’re looking at billing, all of it is done by code. These can change from year
to year (HCPC/CPT) and sometimes they make a whole new code system
(ICD-9 to ICD-10)
Almost everything is aggregated, so you can’t do very many crosstabs
(procedure by patient demographics, for example). And everything with a value
< 11 is suppressed most of the time.
CMS used to protect the identities of doctors in its data, until it lost a lawsuit to
the WSJ. Many other datasets still protect providers’ identities.

Some general tips:
Look at the research, see what studies have been done. Talk to the researchers.
Know that you probably can’t reproduce what they’ve done.
Talk to all the stakeholders: talk to academics, talk to doctors, talk to the
nurses, talk to patients, talk to the people who do the billing.
Read the documentation. This is crucial. Know what you have and don’t have.
Give yourself plenty of time. Inevitably, the data is more complicated than you
think it is (or want it to be).

Follow the money!
* Financial statements. They’re a window into the financial health of a hospital.
My go-to >> https://emma.msrb.org/
* Have a non-profit in your neighborhood? Dig into their 990s >> guidestar.org
* How much free care do hospitals in your community provide? Look up their
community benefit reports. Intrigued about Illinois? Go here:

Follow the money!
* FOIA contracts between government entities and hospitals. This helps you
understand how public dollars are being spent and if public-funded programs
are working as intended.
* Check in with your local and state regulators. Think inspection reports,
project approvals, financial details on how dollars flow. Here’s my go-to >>

Follow the money!
* Want historical trends on costs on everything from ER visits to hip & knee
replacements? Sure, you can FOIA CMS, but that may take a while. Also check
in with the Agency for Healthcare Quality and Research
(https://www.ahrq.gov/) & the Health Care Cost Institute
(http://www.healthcostinstitute.org/)

Still following the money …
* Covering public companies …
>> Find friendly, insightful analysts!
>> Become familiar with SEC filings: www.sec.gov
>> Seeking Alpha for transcripts of calls
* Covering insurers? Monitor rate filings and financial statements with the
National Association of Insurance Commissioners: http://www.naic.org/
