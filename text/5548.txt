6 - RIDE SAFETY: WATER PARKS, FAIRS, AMUSEMENT PARKS



How safe Ferris wheels and water slides are depends on the state in which you reside.
Some states regulate the amusement-park/fair ride industry; others don’t. Florida, for
example, has carved out an exemption to exclude Disney World from state oversight.



For states with oversight, FOIA inspection reports at fairs, amusement parks and water
parks.



require a report only when someone has been admitted to a hospital – that’s the case in
Ohio.

Lawsuits. Who has sued the park and for what reason?



did it take the state to investigate?

Complaints do not become public unless the state medical board concludes that
sanctions are warranted.



Medicare Part D Prescription data – available from the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services – details prescribing habits by doctor. Who are the top prescribers of
what drugs? Is there a sudden spike in the doctor’s prescribing habits? (Medicare is the
government-sponsored insurance for the elderly and the disabled. Their drug claims
represent about a quarter of all prescriptions and are a strong indicator if there is
something hinky going on.) https://data.cms.gov/part-d-prescriber

the poor and children.
