juvenile justice system

Road map
• I’ll brieﬂy talk about some general Bps in juvenile jusBce
reporBng
• And then point to some data resources that can supplement
your reporBng (and why you have to be very careful with
them).
• Brieﬂy talk about a story.

Bureaucracy is your friend!
CorrecBon faciliBes in general document everything.
Youth jails and treatment centers, because of their stated
mission of rehabilitaBon, in parBcular document the smallest
things.
There is always a paper trail and more and more it’s becoming a
data trail.

Bureaucracy is not your friend!
Under various state and federal laws, much of what goes on in
the juvenile jusBce system is secret.
And state agencies interpret juvenile conﬁdenBality laws very
broadly, parBcularly in response to FOIA requests making it hard
to get reliable data on how children are really being treated.
But there are ways around this.

Blank forms and sample copies
• Get copies of blank forms using FOIA. This will tell you the
kind of informaBon the agency retains and how they organize
it.
• This will also tell you the data they collect and give you an
idea of what to request.
• If you know what you’re asking for, it’s harder for agencies to
turn you down.
• These are blank incident reports, data entry forms, rosters,
billing invoices, etc.

Identify the joints in the
system
• More than one agency oVen has the informaBon you need.
• If the state won’t release, go to the county or city.
• Another good source is state procurement oﬃces.

Anonymize and negotiate
• Get to know the data person at the juvenile jusBce agency in
your state.
• They have a wealth of non-idenBfying data that you can get.
• I have also had success negoBaBng with agencies to remove
pieces and parts of informaBon. Give me a month rather than
a speciﬁc date or give me an age rather than a DOB.

Go to the data source
• There is a lot of federal and state data on juvenile jusBce but
much of it is ﬂawed.
• Juvenile correcBons data oVen is reliant on a 20-year-old
guard with a high school educaBon ﬁlling out a complex
spreadsheet.
• Understanding how the data is collected will allow you to
know how best to use it.

Finding sources
• Oﬃce of Juvenile JusBce and Delinquency PrevenBon’s
directory of state contacts
• h[p://www.ojjdp.gov/statecontacts/resourcelist.asp
• Pro: This is a good starBng point to ﬁnd state sources.
• Con: OJJDP is not great at keeping this updated.

School disciplinary data

• Usually available in nice clean csvs from state websites like
this one.
• h[ps://adedata.arkansas.gov/statewide/CounBes/
DisciplinaryInfracBons.aspx

Juvenile arrest stats
• h"p://www.ojjdp.gov/ojstatbb/ezaucr/asp/ucr_display.asp
• Pro: Gives general context and can be useful in some limited
ways.
• Con: Only as recent as 2012. Also, it’s notoriously incomplete.
• The coverage rate for the U.S. hovers in the 70 percent range.
And then there are states like Alabama...

Alabama
• NO numbers reported in 2011 and 2 percent reporBng in
2012.

Juvenile arrest stats
• Always check the coverage for your state before using any of
these numbers.
h[p://www.ojjdp.gov/ojstatbb/ezaucr/asp/coverage.asp
• And always read the methodology.
h[p://www.ojjdp.gov/ojstatbb/ezaucr/asp/methods.asp

Corrections data
• Most states publish detailed annual reports full of data on the
children in their care.
• This data is usually more reliable than juvenile arrest staBsBcs,
but that’s not saying much.

Arkansas example

• h[p://humanservices.arkansas.gov/dys/dysReports/FY2014%20ANNUAL%20REPORT.pdf

Incident data
• Assaults
• Injuries
• Restraints

So, this good data right?

No. It’s mostly not.
Juvenile jusBce agencies notoriously count the wrong things,
publish incorrect data and use the veil of juvenile conﬁdenBality
to mask bad things that happen to kids.
There is no easy answer to this.

Incident reporting problems
• For a few years, I tracked assaults, ﬁghts and injuries in the
juvenile treatment centers in Arkansas.
• The state faciliBes had problems of their own but at least they
were reporBng a decent amount of incidents.
• But I kept noBcing that very few, if any, juvenile detenBon
centers (local juvenile jails that house both state and county
kids) were reporBng.

For example: October 2014
• I got a very nervous call from the Arkansas Department of
Human Services.
• I had requested a chunk of emails from head of the state’s
youth services division.
• The spokesperson said my FOIA was ready, and she wanted
me to know she would be ready to take my call once I looked
through it. I would know it when I saw it, she said.
• So what was the it here?

The Wrap

A brief aside

I had just gotten married
• I was leaving for my honeymoon the next day.
• So.
• I wrote really fast, got home incredibly late, and then I ﬂew oﬀ
to California the next morning.

Cheers

When I got back
• I knew that we had to start looking for a pa[ern but because
the JDCs weren’t reporBng nice clean csv data, we would need
to do the data collecBon ourselves.
• So we started with the current year. We requested about 8
months (YTD 2014) worth of internal incident reports from
the Yell County Juvenile DetenBon Center.
• They responded with a stack of paper reports in varying
forms.

They looked like this

What we found was troubling

Initial Rindings
• The Wrap and a mechanical restraint chair were used most
oVen — in 40 of 52 incidents — to punish kids for bad
language, vulgar gestures, name-calling, yelling, screaming or
banging on walls or doors.

More digging
• So we requested three more years of incident reports.
• And we found worse punishments.

That looked like this

X 800

We turned it into this

Findings
• Between 2011 and October 2014, there were 130 uses The
Wrap, pepper spray, a mechanical restraint chair or a
combinaBon.
• In at least 106 of those instances, staﬀ members used
restraints in response to behavior that didn’t threaten the
safety of guards or the youths.
• In 34 incidents, The Wrap or pepper spray was used in
response to solely verbal misbehavior, name-calling, vulgar
gestures or throwing soV objects, such as blankets, toilet
paper or socks.

Five extreme cases
• A girl was pepper sprayed in The Wrap.
• Two boys were hogBed for a total of four hours.
• A suicidal boy was placed in The Wrap and pepper sprayed
because he wouldn’t calm down.
• A boy was pepper-sprayed for mouthing.
• A youth was placed in The Wrap for six hours with only two
short breaks.

A video and discrepancies

Impact
• In response to the stories, the Youth Services Division pulled
their kids from the lockup.
• The director was ﬁred.
• The facility now has a new director and they no longer use
pepper spray, The Wrap or a mechanical restraint chair.
• Staﬀ have been retrained.

Impact
• There’s an ongoing federal civil rights invesBgaBon.
• The two oﬃcers were arrested and charged with ba[ery.
• DYS has also stepped up its monitoring of JDCs including
sending monitors into faciliBes to review the type of reports
we did. (They say they weren’t gemng all of the reports
before we got them).

Parting thought: Be skeptical
• If we had believed the state’s data, we would have missed a
huge injusBce being perpetrated against kids.
• At the outset, the state refused to give us redacted copies of
these reports and they sBll do today. We were lucky that the
county did.
• And when we got ready to publish, we ended up giving the
state copies of the very reports that they wouldn’t release to
us under FOIA. And we had a lot more than they did.
