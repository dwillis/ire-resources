Digging deeper with data and documents

Jennifer LaFleur

Sometimes stories originate like this:

Or like this:

It can make this

Into this

People are awesome

Investigations need to be supported by a foundation of
data and documents

Documents
Audits/OIG/GAO reports
• Financial reports
• Letters
• Lawsuits
• Forms
•

Understand how documents get made. What’s the
process of whatever you are covering? Who touches
the process? What’s required?

And, it’s 2016. Most government information is on computers.

Sometimes documents need to become data to be
useful.

Getting dox into data
•

Data entry (not just one person)
• PDF extractors: Tabula, Cometdocs, XPDF

or

or

“Data” is not just rows and columns

Video
Sound

The power of combining data

We look for the extremes (after checking the data).

Warning: Extreme nerdiness

Finding data
If something is inspected
• Licensed
• Enforced or
• Purchased
…There probably is a database
•

Finding data
In rare joyous instances data is
readily available online for
download (but be careful)

Finding data
Sometimes we have to scrape it.

Finding data
More often we need to go to an
agency to get the data
This can be tricky if an agency
doesn’t want to release it.

Retention
schedules

Retention
schedules

Sometimes, there is no data.
But it’s okay because there are
techniques for sampling and building
a database.

SOURCE: Local health department
inspection reports
FINDINGS: At 28% of the venues,
more than half of the concession
stands or restaurants had been cited
for at least one "critical" or "major"
health violation.

Source: 311 calls for downed trees
Findings: After a tornado swept across New York City, 311
calls for downed trees helps trace its path

The tools
Spreadsheet
• Database
• Mapping/Satellite data
• Statistics
• Algorithms
• Visualization tools
•

Data, like Pigpen, is usually dirty

Bulletproof your data
Before ever reporting data or building an app
• Do integrity checks to find the flaws
• Add caveats where necessary
• Our own analysis rather than relying on an agency’s
analysis
•

External checks
Read the documentation. Understand the
contents of every field.
• Know how many records you should have.
• Check counts and totals against reports.
• Are all possibilities included?
•

Internal checks
•

•
•

•

Compare fields to check for red
flags
More teachers than students
More money going to vendors
than to contractors
What things just don’t make
sense

Integrity checks for every data set
•

Check for missing data or misplaced data

Integrity checks for every data set
Check for missing data, misplaced data or blank fields
• Check for duplicates
•

Integrity checks for every data set
Check for missing data, misplaced data or blank fields
• Check for duplicates
• Check for duplicates
•

Integrity checks for every data set
Check for missing data, misplaced data or blank fields
• Check for duplicates
• Check for outliers and extreme ups and downs
•

Truck accidents by year and agency

Beyond the basics
Check with experts
• Know the standards
• Find out what others have done
• Gut check – does it just seem wrong?
• Watch your numbers language
•

Beyond the basics
Check with experts
• Know the standards
• Find out what others have done
• Gut check
• Numbers language
• Go physically see a record or spot check against
documents
•

Checks when you’re matching data
A name is not enough. Lots of people have the same name
Get dates of birth and
other information to
make sure you have
the correct person.

Even people with seemingly unique names aren’t so unique

Be transparent: Bounce your findings off targets and
tell users/readers/viewers what you did.

Erroneous government databases can often be a story
themselves

123456789 versus 123-456-789

Sometimes missing data is the story

Wash, rinse, repeat

Example:
Bad bridge(s)

Research
•

IRE Resource Center: tips sheets and
previous stories
• Chat with experts in your own newsroom
• News stories
• Academic/government studies
• OIG, GAO reports

Research
•

Data/story research
• Getting the data
• Interviewing the data
• The methodology
• The analysis
• The pitch

Getting the data
•

NICAR data library
• Check the agency Website
• Request from agency
• Create data

Go physically look at the data

The Methodology
Don’t recreate the wheel
• Use the IRE resource center and your experts
• Keep notes as you go
• Use a standard naming convention for files
• Are there certain records that should be
excluded because of problems?
•

The Methodology
•

Borrow / steal from social scientists and other
analysts
• Review what they’ve already done and then
interview them
• Develop a hypothesis to test

Sometimes you might have to fight for records

Tips for digging
Request data early
Get out and talk to real people
Keep track of your work and stay
organized
Understand the process of what
you’re covering

Tips for digging
Request records and data early
• Get out and talk to real people
• Keep track of your work and stay
organized
• Understand the process of what
you’re covering
• Confirm and corroborate
• Make it something worth reading,
listening to, watching
•

Know what laws govern the
records
you are seeking

A check list to help negotiate for data and
records, of all kinds
(in a perfect world):

Assume the records are public.

Know the law
Do your homework
Be persistent
Appeal
Who else has the same records?
Check retention schedules
Ask for record layout for electronic
records
Carry a flash drive

Know what you’re asking for
Follow, follow, follow
Pick it up
Know the law
Be willing to negotiate
Write about it

Be ready for excuses

Our computer
system can’t do
that.

We can give you
only printed
pages

We don’t have
the authority to
do that

Our database is on a
mainframe and it’s very
complicated, Missy

If we give you the
actual data, you
might change it.

That will cost $25,000.

That uses proprietary
software.

That information is
protected by law

We don’t keep that on
computer

Okay, we do, but
it’s a lot of files
