Investigations in the Fast Lane:
Some Rules for the Road

Go. Just Go.
• Have a calamity bag in the office. (batteries,
walkie‐talkies, water bottles)
• Send bodies as soon as it’s safe.
• Don’t worry who the reporters are.
• Don’t worry about the expense.
• Make the reporters fear hell’s fury if they
don’t call in
• Get a staff story up asap

Name a Lead Driver
(and a Navigator)

In a big story, one person should be running things—a coordinator
But there should also be a planner/investigations editor.
OBJECTIVE: PLAN, PLAN, PLAN

Day One‐‐Breaking
• Assign a rewrite person to handle field reports
• Assign someone to tackle the agency/industry
websites
• Look for data and docs. Download if possible.
• Look for watchdogs (Inspector General
reports, General Accountability Office,
whistleblowers)
• Keep beat reporters involved

Day One—What is Known;
And What We Need to Know
• Blast Jolts Oil World ‐‐‐ Gulf Rig Explodes, 11
Missing; Potential Blow to Industry

• The explosion was likely caused by a blowout, an
uncontrolled burst of oil and natural gas from the well.
• The disaster came five years after a BP refinery
explosion killed 15 people.
• Months of wrangling might ensue as to who was to
blame for the fire: BP or its contractors.
• The event could jeopardize President Obama’s plans to
open new areas to drilling.
• A drilling boom had left companies searching for
experienced workers.
• The incident could spark calls for greater regulation on
drilling.

Day One—End of Day
• With apologies to Elton John, Don’t Let the
Sun Go Down without the Big Meeting
• Get field reporters on phone and debrief them
• Fill a whiteboard with the Big Questions
• File any obvious FOIAs that need to get in asap
(911 tapes, police reports)

The Next Week
• Put some (organized) reporter in charge of
FOIAs
• Look for lawsuits against the players involved
(PACER/lexis‐nexis/courthouse)
• Look for former employees (pro/con)
• Look for academic papers/dissertations
• Navigator should be mapping the plans

The Roadmap
• What—precisely—caused the explosion?
• Why did 11 people die?
• Was the evacuation orderly?
• What do we know about BP’s record?
• What do we know about Transocean’s record?
• Is drilling safe? How do we know?
• Is the oversight agency on the ball?
• How is offshore drilling inspected?
• How are offshore workers trained?
• WAS THE DEEPWATER HORIZON AN ANOMALY?

When to Punch the Gas
• Publish fast when solid, even if it’s brief
• Put up a flag that you’re exploring certain
questions/ideas
• Focus on what you do best
• Know what to cede to others

HOUSTON ‐‐ The U.S. Coast Guard said Friday that oil appears to have stopped gushing from a well on the
floor of the Gulf of Mexico, lessening the likelihood of a major environmental catastrophe.
Officials also said they were calling off the search for the 11 missing workers feared to have died in the
explosion and fire.
"We have just made a very difficult decision to suspend the search," said Coast Guard Rear Admiral Mary
Landry in a news conference late Friday. She added that the search would be reactivated if there are any
indications that point to survivors.
The image of the rig engulfed in flames and spewing black smoke has stirred up debate among Democrats
about whether to push ahead with plans to increase offshore drilling.
The massive drilling rig, the Deepwater Horizon, caught fire Tuesday evening about 50 miles off Louisiana.
It had finished drilling an 18,000‐foot deep well and was cementing the pipes in place when the incident
occurred.
While the well is no longer spewing oil, the Coast Guard cautioned there was still reason for concern. The
rig held 700,000 gallons of diesel in tanks in its enormous pontoons. It isn't clear whether that fuel sunk
with the rig or is spilling into the water. …
