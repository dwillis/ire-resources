Digging Into the
Environment

The environment beat
This beat, more than any other,
has more data than any other.
The bad news?
It has some of the worst data.
Some of it defies belief.

Data, data everywhere
Scores of records out there.
Reports, audits, permit files.
Databases of permits, regulatory
actions, testing, inventories,
surveys.
Budgets, staffing levels, e-mails.
Maps, aerials, satellite imagery.

Bad data
Maps that don’t accurately map
what they’re supposed to.
Permit databases that lack data
about -- wait for it -- permits.
Reports that are supposed to
report totals to Washington that
don’t report everything.

Vanishing Wetlands
www.sptimes.com/wetlands
The national policy of No Net Loss
of wetlands: “the illusion of
environmental protection.”
Used permit databases, documents
and satellite imagery analysis.
84,000 acres lost during No Net
Loss.

Vanishing Wetlands
Ongoing story, lasting now more
than two years, involving
thousands of pages of documents,
200 gigabytes of data and
hundreds of interviews.
Using and managing data.
How the hell?

Permitting databases
If done right, it’s a one stop shop
for everything a regulatory agency
does.
Who, what, where, when, why.
Tracking and statistics.
But it’s a big if. Ruthlessly check.
Don’t stop with your analysis.

Re-using data
If you can, put the databases on
your newsroom intranet and make
them lookup tables.
A FOIA machine.
In the long run, more useful to us
as lookups than an analysis tool.

Re-using data
Having several lookup tables
enabled us to layer information.
Note the congressional database?
Project names to permit numbers,
permit numbers to project names.
Using one to find another.

Managing data
What to do with all this data?
We used a wiki.
Massive, fully searchable text
database.
Good at storing messy data.
Sharing, collaborating, retrieving.
How power gets applied.

HB759
We got a tip…
Records request turned up emails, bill drafts (with notes) and
meeting minutes.
Used a wiki to track and detail
each person (their employer,
campaign contributions, etc.)
Used Social Network Analysis

Find New Data
The key finding of the whole
project was found in satellite
imagery.
One key lesson: sometimes, to
answer a question, you have to get
the answer yourself.
Don’t be afraid of ambition.

So, how?
First: I had to learn how.
Does your company have a tuition
reimbursement program? Use it.
Second: Hardware and software.
Third: Lay out a methodology.
This is critical: You must
understand what you are after.

The analysis
Multi-spectral imagery
Simple methods, based on other
similar studies.
Unsupervised classifications, wide
range of ancillary data.
We did it twice.
An accuracy assessment is a must.

Questions?
Find new ways to use data, for
short and long term.
Find new ways to manage data,
again for short and long term.
Find new data, new ways of
answering questions.
