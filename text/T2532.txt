GAMBLING & CASINO PROBES:
“MEMBERSHIP DISPUTES”

Membership
•

Membership disputes are more likely in tribes with “per capita” payments-- cash disbursements made
directly to the members. Divorce records are one of the few ways to establish the size of these
payments.

•

Federal policy empowers tribes to handle all membership issues. Rules are outlined in a tribe’s
constitution. However, many constitutions are very basic and do not guarantee membership to
qualified Indians.

•

Membership disputes can be addressed in tribal courts. However, many judges have conflicts of
interest, and tribal courts have a long history of failing to uphold basic human rights. Tribal courts
make for good stories in their own right.

Regulation
• Tribal gaming revenue is growing and regulation isn’t keeping up. That means Indian gaming is
essentially “self-regulating.”
•

State regulation, for the most part, works on the honor system (Minnesota tribes brought in 1.4 billion
in revenue, but the state budget for regulation is 150,000).

•

Federally, the National Indian Gaming Commission regulates 350 Indian casinos in 30 states with 79
staffers. By comparison New Jersey, with 12 commercial casinos in Atlantic City, has 700 regulatory
employees.

Culture
• Be respectful of the culture you’re reporting on.
• It’s okay to say “Indian”
• Bring tobacco
• Be patient, it may take “four days”
More Background
• 350 Indian casinos in 30 states. Nationwide, Indian Gaming is a 16.7 billion dollar industry.
• California, Connecticut, and Minnesota are top three in revenue.
• Tribal casino gross profit margin is 40% of revenue. Commercial 25%.
• Many groups are currently petitioning for federal recognition as tribes. This happens by pairing up
with a wealthy investor who pays for the expensive genealogical studies and necessary lobbying
efforts. If successful, these non-Indian investors often fund the building of the casino operation and
receive substantial profits.
