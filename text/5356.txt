PDF Wrangling

The problem
Fairly often most of us run into something like this

So we have learned to cope...

Goals
1. Extract data from pdfs
2. Break up and assemble some pdfs
3. Get some info out of a pdf
4. Make a pdf searchable using OCR

Tools
1. Cometdocs
2. Tabula
3. Pdftk
4. pdfinfo
5. OCR tools (some free/some that cost $)

We will also use the command line
The command line is a power tool built right into
your computer. Learning to use it can help you
save time and rid yourself of repetitive tasks such
as working with difficult pdfs.

How to find the command line
Windows: Go to your start menu and type
“command” in the search bar
Linux/Unix: This is your terminal

To get started

echo “This is not scary”

Using command line tools

directory

pdftk
Type pdftk
Type pdftk -h (fuller help explanation)
(the -h is called a “flag”)

Manafort indictment

Just tables

pdftk
Pull out specific pages we want
pdftk manafort_indictment.pdf cat 7-14 output
just_tables.pdf
pdftk manafort_indictment.pdf cat 1 4 10 output
specific_pages.pdf

pdftk
Add files from multiple pdfs into one
Pdftk A=just_tables.pdf B=specific_pages.pdf cat
A1-2 B1-2 output new_file.pdf

pdftk
Break a pdf into individual pages
Pdftk manafort_indictment.pdf burst
Put it back together
Pdftk *.pdf cat output new_man.pdf

xpdf/pdfinfo
Pdfs have a lot of data connected to them that you can’t see.
This metadata can tell you a lot about the document that you
have and can aid in reporting.

pdfinfo

pdfinfo
Now pdfinfo in the command line can give you even more information.
It can also help you avoid outing sources.

pdfinfo
Pdfinfo file_name.pdf
Pdfinfo -meta file_name.pdf

Making Image PDFs searchable

OCR (Optical character recognition)
Many times you will get PDFs that are image
files, not native computer generated pdfs. You
can’t search image files and when you get
hundreds and hundreds of pages that’s a
problem. That’s where OCR comes in.
