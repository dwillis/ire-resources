TEN THINGS TO LOOK FOR IN CAMPAIGN FINANCE FILINGS
1.) The burn rate. How much a candidate has raised and spent. A candidate who spends
money as quickly as he or she raises it is worse off than a candidate who raises less but
has more money in the bank.
2.) Largest contributors. Fifty employees of a company, all giving the maximum $4,600
for the primary and general election, can add more than $200,000 to the campaign's
coffers.
3.) Political action committee money. PAC donations closely track an incumbent's
committee assignments. What issues is the lawmaker concerned with and who is giving?
4.) Opponents' fundraising. If the challenger isn't raising any money, it is a sign that the
incumbent is not in any great danger, despite any spin from party consultants.
5.) Comparisons. How do the totals compare with previous figures during the same
period during the last election.
6.) Spending. What is the money being used for, not only advertisements and direct mail
but also whether it's going to the babysitter, haircuts, the new car, parking tickets or trips.
7.) Helping out. Is the lawmaker contributing to other candidates or getting contributions
from his or her colleagues?
8.) Helping hands. Who is helping the candidate raise money. Does a lobbyist serve as
campaign treasurer? Who has hosted fundraisers?
9.) Money breakdown. How much money does the candidate raise from the district or the
state as opposed to elsewhere?
10.) Leadership PACs. Does the lawmaker have his or her personal PAC? Who's giving.
Are they the same interests funding the campaign?
