Don’t lament a lack of resources. Make the most of your resources.

Two-camera shoots:
Why:
• Allows story to play like a conversation
• Shows viewers you are asking challenge questions
• Adds personality to investigation
How:
• One photographer sets-up two cameras
• Photographer mans camera shooting interview subject
• Use video monitor to watch second camera on reporter
• Synchronize timecode on cameras
• No audio mixer needed. Feed one microphone to each camera.

Travel – inexpensive ways to make your investigation special :

• Present budget: News director is more likely to approve travel if budget is
established in advance.
• Price it yourself – independent of corporate travel department
• Negotiate with hotels
• Consider freelance photographer and negotiate
• Consider shooting with affiliate station
• Manage overtime
• Schedule multiple shoots for one trip

Foreign travel:
• Hire photographer/fixer in destination country: Contact Associated Press for
fixer/APTV for photographer
• Use hotel driver – not taxi or freelance driver

Collaborate with other stations:

• Use your station group for out of town elements
• Check with other stations to find sizzling story elements: confrontation, victim
interview, surveillance, undercover video
• Use your affiliate feed service, CNN Newsource or NNS to find way to share
video.

Invest in quality equipment:

• Good lighting equipment
• New undercover equipment – reshooting wastes time/resources and is a legal
liability

Time management:

• Allow plenty of time for rough-cut, screening and re-cut
• Create time for balance in life

Interns:

• Contact your local law school for students skilled in research, writing and legal
pitfalls
