SPENDING. Taxpayers for Common Sense, www.taxpayer.net, has a well-earned reputation for
tracking spending.
TRADE PRESS AND NEWSLETTERS. Most industries have trade publications and
newsletters covering them and the regulators that regulate them. More news orgs are
duplicating these traditional publications with “verticals,” or “pro” subscription products. Some
of these can be found on Nexis or Factiva sites.
PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS. Nearly every industry has a trade group or professional
association, often based in Washington and state capitals, to represent the industry’s interests.
Find the group and get their publications. Most are online and sometimes do not require a signin.

Securities and Exchange web site where mandatory disclosures by public companies are posted.
Documents there include 10-Q and 10-K (quarterly and annual reports) DEF-14A (proxy

http://ldi.bvdep.com and lists the executives at every company. It's expensive but worth it if
you can afford it.

have an ax to grind, can often provide inside information. Check lawsuits, get internal
directories, get names off web sites and Google searches.
LABOR UNIONS. Often know more about a company than the company officials, where the
bodies are buried. But they also sometimes have an interest to keep the secrets secret. Union
officials can put you in touch with employees.
REGULATORS. Rule-making, fines, citations, policy agendas -- often everything important
runs through the federal, state and local agencies that regulate industries. Check rule dockets,
warning letters, enforcement actions, file public-record requests for meetings with officials ad
dozens of agencies, including EPA, USDA, Commerce, DOD, Education, HHS, Homeland
Security, HUD, DOJ, Labor, State, Interior and Treasury. Dockets are found at the rulemaking
“gateway.” https://www.regulations.gov/ The eRulemaking Program was created in 2002 as an
E-Government project and is managed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEES. Find out which legislative and congressional committees have
jurisdiction over the industry. Look at legislation, appropriation bills, hearing reports,
investigative reports. FOIA lawmaker correspondence with regulatory agencies. But call the
FOIA office or check online first because some agencies post the logs online. Here’s the
Department of Homeland Security: https://www.dhs.gov/publication/congressionalcorrespondence-logs

tax-exempt, nonprofit organizations are available in a variety of places, including Propublica’s
search engine. The data for nonprofit tax returns going back as far as 2001.

taking a backseat to state regulators who are more and more putting up records, including the
widely used California AG’s Registry of Charitable Trusts site at
http://caag.state.ca.us/charities/. It is still good at some of the harder-to-find stuff. The

Foundation Center www.fdncenter.org has tax returns and financial info on
charities/trusts. Click on Foundation Finder, http://foundationcenter.org/find-funding/990finder, which has details and tax returns on 70,000 private and community foundations, or to

FOLLOW THE MONEY
CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS. Track federal campaign contributions by individual, company
or industry at www.opensecrets.org, the Web site of the Center for Responsive Politics. CRP
codes donations to make them more accessible than they are on the Federal Election

historical campaign finance information. http://www.cfinst.org/
FUND RAISERS–Political Party Time http://politicalpartytime.org is a crowd-sourced project
to track parties for members of Congress or congressional candidates that happen all year round
in Washington, D.C. and beyond. Sources send invitations involving members of Congress to
Party Time, but since this is all voluntary, the information contained in this database is by no
means complete. Searchable by member, committee, etc. Politwoops, which tracks deleted tweets
from politicians, is at ProPublica. The Congress API is operated by ProPublica. House Expenditure
Reports are published by ProPublica
Another service tracking parties, including political fundraisers, is http://guestofaguest.com/
which was founded by Cameron Winklevoss, one of the brothers who famously sued Mark
Zuckerberg over Facebook. Guestofaguest is a database of parties with calendar and photos
designed for the social scene.
DARK MONEY--Dark money is political spending designed to influence an election and the
source of the money is not disclosed. The most common organizations shielding their sources of
money are 501(c) organizations. These groups can engage in varying amounts of political activity
and because they are not technically political organizations, they are not required to disclose
their donors to the public. These groups under the law cannot coordinate with political parties
or candidates and therefore are allowed to raise unlimited sums of money from individuals,
organizations and corporations. Opensecrets has a search page for nonprofit political groups
http://www.opensecrets.org/dark-money/explore-our-reports.php
527 Groups - IRS Data. The IRS has made the disclosures filed by section 527 organizations—the
independent political committees that can raise money in unlimited amounts from any source—
searchable, albeit with a cranky, complicated, squint-inducing interface. You get raw data from
the search, but right now it’s the best thing going on 527s. The data is available here:
http://forms.irs.gov/politicalOrgsSearch/search/gotoBasicSearch.action
http://forms.irs.gov/politicalOrgsSearch/search/gotoAdvanced8871Search.action

link on site to estimate members personal wealth. Trump administration financial disclosures.
https://www.opensecrets.org/trump/financial-disclosures Also, the very useful Web site,
http://www.legistorm.com/ has information on congressional trips, the raw financial
disclosure forms and congressional staffer salaries. Legistorm pretty much took over where
others left off, such as the Center for Public Integrity which had Medill’s database of trips from
2005 and updated it a few years ago (but not lately)
TRIPS. Reports of certain expenditures for all official foreign travel by Members and staff of the
U.S. House of Representatives are filed publicly under law. Reports from 1994 through the
current quarter are printed in the Congressional Record and can be searched here:
http://clerk.house.gov/public_disc/foreign/index.aspx Lawmakers trips found on CQ
PoliticalMoneyLine, http://moneyline.cq.com also has analyzed privately funded travel
from 2000 to 2006 as disclosed by members and senators.
