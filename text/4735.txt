Hey kids, it’s MIDITIME!

Hey, California: Oklahoma had 3
times as many earthquakes in 2014
Oklahoma recorded more than three times as many earthquakes as California in 2014 and remains well
ahead in 2015. Data from the U.S. Geological Survey shows that Oklahoma had 562 earthquakes of
magnitude 3.0 or greater in 2014; California had 180. As of Jan. 31, Oklahoma recorded 76 earthquakes of
that magnitude, compared with California’s 10.
According to the Advanced National Seismic System global catalog, in 2014, Oklahoma even beat Alaska,
the nation’s perennial leader in total earthquakes, though many small events in remote areas go
unrecorded there.
In California, earthquakes always have been relatively common, but in Oklahoma, they were much more
rare – at least until 2009.

Scales are scales
d_minor = ['D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'A', 'Bb', 'C']
magnitudes = 0 - 5.7

So magnitude 5.7 would be 0 percent of the scale, or D.

Magnitude 3.0 would be 53 percent of the scale, or G.
