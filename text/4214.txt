Syllabus – Investigative Skills
Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism
Duff Wilson
Spring Semester 2014
One Credit, Five Wednesdays, April 2-30, 6-9 pm
COURSE DESCRIPTION: An introduction to investigative reporting skills focusing on public
records, sources and computer-assisted reporting. We will also talk about the values of
investigative reporting – accountability, justice and public service – guiding story selection.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES: By the end of this class, you should know the basics of
investigative reporting: what it is, why to do it, how to do it, and what gives it impact. These
skills will improve all of your reporting. Here are the specific goals of the course:
You’ll learn how to obtain public records and use them in your reporting.
You will be able to employ expert strategies to identify and cultivate sources and
persuade reluctant interviewees.
 You’ll be capable of downloading electronic databases and using Excel for computerassisted reporting.
 You’ll learn investigative skills for beat reporting, breaking news and quick-hitting
enterprise stories, as well as groundbreaking longer-term projects.



TEACHING METHODS: Presentations, discussions, demonstrations, exercises and handouts.
We’ll dissect, briefly, some of the best investigative reporting being done today, including a
number of recent Pulitzer Prize winners. And we’ll have an outstanding guest speaker, Alan
Schwarz of The New York Times.
READINGS: You’ll be expected to read the investigative articles or view the programs below
and to be prepared to discuss them in class, focusing on method. Other stories may be assigned
as they emerge. I’ll provide my own tip sheets in advance of each class; be prepared to discuss.
Optionally, you may want to join the group Investigative Reporters and Editors ($25 for
students) and purchase The Investigative Reporter’s Handbook (Fifth Edition). We will not be
covering this book in such a short class, but I recommend it for your benefit.
GRADES: Your grades will be based on preparation, participation and three small assignments.

MY BIO: I am an investigative reporter with Reuters and previously with The New York Times
and The Seattle Times. In January 2012, I joined the Reuters global enterprise unit in New York
as a reporter and associate editor for investigative projects. For seven years before that, I did
sports investigations and business enterprise and beat reporting (drug and tobacco companies) for
The New York Times, and previous to that, investigative projects for The Seattle Times.
My work has been honored with two Harvard University Goldsmith Prizes for Investigative
Reporting; two George Polk Awards, for medical and local reporting; a Gerald Loeb Award for
Distinguished Business and Financial Journalism; two National Headliner Awards; and public
service awards from both the Associated Press Managing Editors and The Newspaper Guild,
among more than 30 national and regional journalism awards. I’ve been three times a Pulitzer
finalist, for Breaking News Reporting, Investigative Reporting and Public Service.
I grew up in a weekly newspaper family – both father and mother – in a small town out west.
Now I live in the East Village here in NYC. I have a master’s degree from Columbia (1982) .
I’ve served on the board of Investigative Reporters and Editors and won the IRE book award for
“Fateful Harvest” (HarperCollins, 2001). I’ve contributed to two textbooks and previously taught
at the University of Washington in Seattle and at IRE national conferences. I’m webmaster of
The Reporter’s Desktop, a nonprofit, collaborative launch pad for daily and investigative
reporting, www.reporter.org/desktop.
COURSE OUTLINE: These contents may shift to keep pace with your learning.
CLASS #1: (April 2): Introduction to investigative reporting and public records
I’ll introduce myself and ask you why you’re taking this class. Please think about that in
advance. We’ll talk about the classic definition of investigative reporting and consider how that
applies to the news today. We will discuss your experience with public records.
Before class you should read my handout “FOIA Fundamentals” and also read these stories with
attention to how the reporter got the story and to the sources and public records that were used:
“Death on the Tracks,” The New York Times, July 11, 2004.
http://www.pulitzer.org/archives/6928
 “Is a city manager worth $800,000?” Los Angeles Times, Jul 15, 2010.
http://www.pulitzer.org/archives/9203 and http://www.pulitzer.org/archives/9216
 “Uninformed Consent,” The Seattle Times, March 11, 2005. http://tinyurl.com/unconsent


Investigative reporting relies on public records. We’ll explore how to use a documents state-ofmind to encircle the subject of investigation. I’ll show you how to file public records requests
with agencies through the federal Freedom of Information Act and the New York Freedom of
Information Law (see http://www.rcfp.org/foialetter/index.php). We will talk about how to
identify the best records to seek and how to appeal denials. During class, we will review the
exemptions and winning strategies in http://www.rcfp.org/fogg/index.php?i=ex2
DUE APRIL 7 BY 5 P.M.: (1) A formal request for public records, properly addressed in an email or faxable letter, detailing records you would like a specific agency or office to provide to
you. This does not have to be sent, although you may enjoy sending it to experience the triumphs
and tragedies of the system. (2) The same in a less formal FOIA, as we will describe. (3) A brief,
written description of the investigative reporting benefit of those records and what you would
look for in them. Send this to me in an e-mail with the Subject line “FOIA.”
And be sure to read the articles and handouts for our next class.
CLASS #2 (April 9): Investigating people, corporations and government
In advance of class, please check the Web site “Who is John Doe – and where to get the paper on
him” at http://www.reporter.org/desktop/tips/johndoe.htm and read these stories, noting the use
of records:




Articles by Alan Schwarz on concussions and ADHD, to be assigned.
Seniors for Sale, The Seattle Times, Jan. 30, 2010. http://tinyurl.com/seniorsforsale
“How Washington Went Soft on Childhood Obesity,” Reuters, April 27, 2012.
http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/12/04/Food_lobby.pdf

We’ll be joined today by Alan Schwarz, an investigative reporter with The New York Times
whose determined digging broke the concussions safety story that has changed the tenor of
professional and youth sports, and whose 2013 reporting exposed the overselling of attentiondeficit disorder and stimulant drugs.
Also today we will start to review a constellation of public records and their value. We’ll talk
about handouts showing key records and investigative angles on a variety of beats and topics. I’ll
describe the different levels of courts, focusing on New York. I’ll teach advanced Google. We’ll
explore people-finders including LinkedIn and Lexis-Nexis, deep web search engines and social
network aggregators, testing them on ourselves. We’ll look up campaign and lobbying records,
real estate documents, Securities and Exchange Commission records and the tax filings of nonprofits and charities. I’ll show you a systematic way to check out candidates for public office.
This week we will also talk about some important paper records you can only get with
permission of subjects, such as medical records and FBI rap sheets, and how to get them.

5

DUE APRIL 11 BY 5 PM: During or shortly after our second class, you will select a person,
company or government agency to investigate briefly, or I will assign you one.
DUE APRIL 14 BY 5 PM: E-mail me a CEO’s salary from SEC records, a director’s salary from
an IRS 990, a mortgage term on someone from a county recorder, and an ex-employee name
from LinkedIn (Jan. 13 training). Send this to me in e-mail with the Subject line “RECORDS.”
OVER THE NEXT THREE WEEKS: You will investigate your subject, based largely on public
records on the Web. Do not worry if it is hard to take your investigation very far. Good things
don’t come easy. But try – try hard. We will talk about your progress in Class #4 on April 23 and
the final Class #5 on April 30. By May 5, you will be expected to submit a brief report on your
findings and how they could be developed with further investigation. I don’t expect an amazing
result in this short a time but I would like to see some diligent work with records work. Bear in
mind the definition of investigative reporting.
CLASS #3 (April 16): Sources and interviews
To prepare for this class, read, in advance, my tip sheet “Building Confidential Sources” and this
Rolling Stone profile of Greenwald and Snowden: http://tinyurl.com/greenwaldsnowden. Also,
review the following articles, with an eye toward the use of sources and interviews:
Jerry Sandusky stories, The Patriot-News (Harrisburg, Pa.), March-November 2011.
http://www.pulitzer.org/files/2012/local_reporting/local01.pdf and
http://www.pulitzer.org/files/2012/local_reporting/local04.pdf
 The Child Exchange – Inside America’s underground market for adopted children,”
Reuters, Sept. 9-11, 2013. http://www.reuters.com/investigates/adoption/#article/part1
 “Fear in the Fields” (part one), The Seattle Times, Jan. 3, 1997.
http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19970703&slug=2547772


People skills are essential to investigative reporting. We’ll talk about how to cultivate sources to
help you on a beat or investigative topic area, as well as the motives of sources and the use and
misuse of “off the record.” I’ll show you strategies for finding whistleblowers. We’ll discuss
how to protect sensitive information from cyber-intrusion with tools such as Tails and GPG.
Interviewing subjects, or targets, of investigation, poses a special challenge. They may be wary,
but you need them for fairness and completeness. We’ll discuss how to get them to talk about
sensitive subjects.
We will also cover more of the public records that we didn’t get to last week.
CLASS #4 (April 23): Introduction to data and Excel
To prepare for this class, read the tip-sheets I provided, as well as the following articles with an
eye toward sources and use of data:

6

“An empty-desk epidemic,” The Chicago Tribune, November 2012.
http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/watchdog/truancy/ct-met-truancy-mainbar20121111,0,4307087,full.story
 Weak insurers put millions of Floridians at risk, Sarasota Herald-Tribune, Feb. 28, 2010.
http://www.pulitzer.org/archives/9192


You will learn how to use Excel and avoid common errors. The class includes importing data
sets, sorting and filtering data for investigative results, analyzing data through pivot tables, and
creating basic charts. We’ll also explore a dozen great places to find this data, do some hands-on
work importing data in the laboratory, and talk about some good data story ideas.
We will also talk about your pending reports on a person, company or agency and angles you
may pursue in the remaining few days.
CLASS #5 (April 30 – final class): Investigating on the beat, writing and bullet-proofing
To prepare for this class, read the tip-sheets I provided and the following articles with an eye
toward how the investigation was developed and then shaped into a compelling narrative:
 “Child’s Ordeal Shows Risks of Psychosis Drugs for Young,” The New York Times,
Sept. 1, 2010. http://tinyurl.com/psychdrugskids
 “Mayor lied under oath, text messages show,” Detroit Free Press, Jan. 24, 2008.
http://www.pulitzer.org/archives/8359 and http://www.pulitzer.org/archives/8362
 “Reasonable Doubt: At what cost?” East Valley Tribune, July 9, 2008.
http://www.pulitzer.org/archives/8370
Today, we’ll review your investigative story memos.
Our final class also covers practical advice for actually doing investigative work after graduation,
and loving it. I will share colleagues’ wisdom about dozens of angles to investigate on specific
beats including police, politics and health. I may assign other articles, and we’ll watch an awardwinning local TV broadcast. We’ll review some of the best Web-based investigative centers
including ProPublica and the Center for Investigative Reporting. I’ll also describe some different
styles of investigative reporting that boil down to one idea: you can do it.
Finally, we will review briefly some of the best ways to work with editors, or if you become an
editor, to work with investigative reporters. We’ll talk about organizing investigative
information, writing or broadcasting it compellingly, the one great paragraph, bullet-proofing
your stories and following them up.
DUE MAY 5 BY 5 PM: Submit a story memo (2-3 pages) clearly and succinctly saying what you
have learned about your investigative subject from specified public records. List strategies you
would pursue if you had more time. Send this to me attached to an e-mail with the subject line:
“STORY MEMO.” I’ll return this to you with my comments by May 15.

What is investigative reporting?
1. Important or significant, not merely interesting.
2. Hidden from public view.
3. Mostly the reporter’s own work

"Reporting, through one's own initiative and work product, matters of importance to readers,
viewers or listeners. In many cases, the subjects of the reporting wish the matters under scrutiny
to remain undisclosed.”
Steve Weinberg, Investigative Reporters and Editors

Accountability journalism – classic approaches to investigative reporting:
Follow the rules: Standards and promises
Follow the money: Spending and influence
Post-mortem: What went wrong? Were there warning signs? Who was responsible? How
could this have been prevented?
 Comfort the afflicted
 Afflict the comfortable




The most important part of investigative reporting is story selection. What is worth spending
your time on?

FOIA FUNDAMENTALS
How to get the most out of the Freedom of Information Act
Just do it. Use the federal and state open records laws. Use them again and again. As a
journalist, you don’t have to pay for search time under the FOIA or for most copies. You go to the
front of the line if you can show “urgency to inform the public” on government activity. Most
other citizens do not have these benefits. You need to exercise these muscles for them.
Make it easy on yourself. Make a fill-in-the-blanks FOIA form as a Word document and save it
to your desktop or Documents folder. It has the boilerplate. All you have to do is define what
you want and fax or e-mail it in. Or use the fill-in-the-blanks federal and state forms from the
Reporter Committee for Freedom of the Press (http://www.rcfp.org/foialetter/index.php)
Save time and money. Journalists should ask for expedited treatment, explaining why the public
needs the information soon. Cite a pending government decision, hearing or review of the
subject, or questions that may exist about government integrity which the records could address.
Journalists should also ask for a fee waiver, describing your media connection. Under FOIA, the
first 100 pages of copies are free. Under the New York State FOIL, an agency may charge up to
25 cents a page. But there is no charge for agency search time, or electronic copies, or in-person
inspection of records before you decide what you want to copy, or not.
Be precise. The more specific your request, the faster you can get the records. Go for the sure
winners: complaints, inspections, violations, suspensions, discipline, fatality reports, incident
reports, and what some agencies euphemistically call unusual occurrence reports. Ask for
indexes of records. Be as specific as possible: use an agency’s own regulations, administrative
and enforcement guidelines to identify, by name, exactly what records you want. You can attach
the type of record and ask the agency for all other records of its type (horizontal search) or all
other records concerning the attached record (vertical search). Cover a subject broadly by
requesting “all releasable records concerning (something or somebody) since Jan. 1, 20XX.”
Talk it over. It’s best to talk to regulators, inspectors and enforcement staff in advance. How do
they document their actions? What do they call their complaint/mistake forms? A helpful
background source is a jewel to be treasured. But don’t be put off by lack of that. Go ahead and
fish for records. Cast a wide net. And when you do, don’t just send in the request and sit back.
Call the FOIA officer within the week and talk it over. Maybe there’s a way to get the record
faster without a FOIA. Maybe there’s a way to narrow or focus your request, and in doing that,
speed up the reply. Maybe it would be faster sent to a local or regional office. Call back.
FOIA the FOIAs. One good tactic is to ask for the agency’s own FOIA Case Log to see what
other people (often lawyers or special interests) are seeking. Use the case numbers to get a copy
9

of the letters of request, letters of response, and first X pages of records already provided for
those requests. Note: Some agencies have public access to major FOIA’d records.
R&R. I will give you two words that I have found are the best way to get what you need in
time: redact and release. If part of a record is exempt from disclosure, the agency must redact or
remove that part of the record, and release the remainder. All reasonably segregable non-exempt
portions must be released. Ask them to show you the paper, even if it’s mostly blacked out. Then
you have something in your hands to appeal on reasonableness.
Work with what they have to give. I like to think about the flip side of exemptions. By
reviewing what is exempt according to other FOIA’s, regulations and case law, I learn what is not
exempt. And ask for that. Here are some of the best tactics for turning over the exemptions:


The law enforcement exemption. Applies to open investigative files in ongoing or
potential enforcement proceedings. That makes it difficult to argue with the keepers of
the secret file. But this exemption requires a “concrete prospect” of enforcement
proceedings. I work with what they do have to give: when a case has gone to trial, or
resulted in civil penalties, or not been sustained – in other words when it is indisputably
closed – then I ask for the investigative file. Files also open up on deceased people.



The internal-agency memoranda exemption. When they claim release would interfere
with their work. Fight back using the two magic words: redact and release. If you expect
to encounter this exemption, start making your case in advance: Factual parts of predecisional documents are not exempt and must be released. The agency must make a case
of “foreseeable harm” to trigger the exemption. And even in that case, the agency can
make a discretionary disclosure. You can always ask them to waive the exemption.



The privacy exemption. The FOIA allows an agency to weigh the public interest in
disclosure against the privacy interest of the people named. The Supreme Court has held
the only acceptable public interest was the extent to which disclosure would shed light on
government operations or activities. So if there is possible legislation or a hearing or
proposed regulations in your subject area, talk about how the release could improve the
public’s right to have input with the government. Also, you may have to remind an
agency that “private” is a strictly defined term of law, not synonymous with
embarrassing. Matters which are private are those which are (1) highly offensive to a
reasonable person, such as intimate details of one’s family life, or (2) of no legitimate
concern to the public.

BUILDING CONFIDENTIAL SOURCES
Finding them
Keep a list of prospects and their phone numbers and e-mail addresses:











Former employees.
Axe grinders: Disciplined employees (MSPB). Personal injury lawyers.
Mid-level agency supervisors, Police, who may be more confident talking.
Caseworkers. Cops. Secretaries.
Government investigators – the ones who do the actual work. OIG, GAO…
Union leaders and shop stewards.
Anybody who calls in to the newspaper or station. They’re motivated.
Anybody who is ever quoted in a candid way in another media.
Anybody who ever talks to a reporter.
Friends, family and people in your personal circle.

Find them in the records, too.

15



Phone books. Obtain the employee staff directories and phone books for the agency the
past five years. Compare names to see who’s left.



LinkedIn, former employees.



Professional conferences, speeches and journal articles.



Lawsuits and claims. Lawsuits will often lead you to prospective inside sources. If you’re
looking in a government agency, FOIA the agency asking for a copy of its office indexes
to grievances, claims or lawsuits brought by employees or ex-employees, and to
payments of public funds settling grievances, claims or lawsuits by employees or exemployees. By asking for indexes and following the money, you can sidestep the
attorney-client privilege and plumb the records for whistleblower candidates.



Disciplined employees. Here you find some people with big axes to grind, and best of all,
a lot of them still work there. Naturally, agencies don’t want to talk about these people. A
lot of the folks who have been suspended or fired don’t want to talk, either. But some do.
My suggestion: a regular public-records request asking for all notices to employees for
proposed or final suspensions of one day or more, or terminations, from (date) to (date).
If the agency notifies the employee, ask them to include a note from you. You can also

find federal disciplinary appeals, by department, through the U.S. Merit Systems
Protection Board, www.mspb.gov.

The approach.
You have to spend the time to cultivate sources. It takes time and attention. It’s worth it.
Ask open questions when you visit. “What’s new? What’s going on at your agency?” Show
your interest in their work. What’s their job. How they do it. What’s important to them. Use a
conversational style. Put them at ease. Ask open questions, do not express your opinions. Try to
connect. Size up the people. It won’t take long to figure out who’s going to help you as a source.
Similarly, it will not take a potential source very long to get a sense of how much he or she can
trust you. Your previous work is your best calling card. Your demeanor is important. You are
talking to get to know them and to get them to know you are trustworthy and professional, and to
build a professional relationship. Off the record.
A roadmap source is a gold mine. A confidential source is a diamond mine.
Be direct. When you get to know people -- and sometimes at a first meeting in a friendly sort of
way -- say that you’d love to hear any tips, leaks, anything that might be news or interesting.
They’ll know what you mean. Once upon a time I was shy about simply asking for tips and leaks.
I got over it. You can say almost anything when you’re smiling. A lot of potential sources respect
the sunlight and accountability that we can bring. With your approach, they can be a part of it.
Know the difference between “off the record,” “on background” and “on the record.”
 “Off the record” means absolutely off the record.
 “On background” means you can quote someone with a veiled identity to protect them.
 “On the record” means just that. And you can explain each of these to interviewees.
Don’t pull out your notebook when you are trying to cultivate an off-the-record source. If
you do need to write some notes to remember things, ask the source if it’s okay and then write in
big letters at the top of the page, “Do not quote.” Also be wary of e-mail and phone tracing. The
government can go after all of your records without telling you.
Source motives may be pure – to see something fixed, to get something out in the public – or
not. Some have axes to grind, or want to create trouble for their boss or co-worker, or just like
the excitement. In any event, try to learn their motivation, and obviously, verify everything.
Be professional. Don’t pal up to sources. You’re a reporter looking for sources, not a friend. Your
ability to be worthy of sources by doing serious journalism will show up in the stories you write.
The better your stories are, the more sources will approach you.

16

Bring them in on your work. This is the key to good source work. Sell your journalism.
Explain the importance of your investigative reporting -- public service reporting -- and how they
can help you. Explain why you need to document problems to make things better. I always
assume my sources are public spirited, or at least they like to think of themselves that way. They
can do better by helping you.

Keeping your sources
Check in. Once you've hooked a source on what you can do together, call once a month or so.
Have a cup of coffee with them. Drop by to chat -- not just when you want them to give you
something.
Show you can keep a secret. Be careful what you say to other people. If you are asked how you
know something, the answer is, "Sorry, but I can't talk about that." Prospective sources catch on
if you talk too much. You're the person keeping multiple sources safely compartmentalized. And
ask the source, “How can I be sure this isn’t traced to you?”
Don’t expect too much. There might not always be something to expose in the agency or
company. Be patient. It will pay off.
Keep them involved in on your work. Once a source starts to help you inside an agency, you
might have a problem explaining why you can't do all the stories they suggest. Here again, you
need to bring them in on your profession. Explain why you need a news hook or a dramatic angle
that will capture public attention. Your sources are your eyes and ears.

Data for an investigative state-of-mind
Investigative reporters obtain or create databases and then explore them to make findings.
This is often inherently original work -- one of the three criteria of investigative reporting.
(The other two: significance and hidden.) So get that data from government sources in the
full, unfiltered form. Clean it, slice and dice it in Excel. Then ask the data questions.

19



Payroll records. By sorting from high to low, you can learn who makes the most, and
who makes the most overtime….



Expense reports. Who spent the most? What are they spending money on?
Entertainment? How often do they leave town? What hotels? And how big are the
restaurant bills? …



Campaign contributions. Who gives the most? And why? The first stop for most
journalists is opensecrets.org from the Center for Responsive Politics. It cleans up
Federal Elections Commission reports and also imports lobbying reports from the Senate
and House, albeit with some delay. The Open Secrets site easily shows donors’
affiliations, lobbyist revolving doors, and the financial disclosure reports of members of
Congress. Influence Explorer takes this data a step further, offering downloadable
campaign contribution and lobbying reports: http://data.influenceexplorer.com/?r# You
can also download local and state data. Next: what did the special interest want?



Government contracts. In a department or agency, how do they track contracts
electronically? What contracts are bid? Are companies getting no-bid contracts? …



Parking tickets, speeding tickets. Repeat offenders? People driving 100 mph? …



The state’s fleet of airplanes. Who used them, where, why, and what cost?



Crime. Comparing years, crimes, neighborhoods…



Sex offenders. Obtain all the full database and sort it. How many have “address
unknown”?



State grants. From who, to whom?



Food safety inspections. Get the raw data, not just
http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/rii/index.shtml



Government spending. Data showing all checks that are written, amounts, to and from,
and budget categories.



Drunken driving offenders. Data from the court system showing names of people who
are convicted or plead guilty, charges, outcomes… How well is the law being enforced?
Who’s getting off?

Here are some other good sources of data for investigative reporting:


Death certificates. Causes of death, gun-related deaths over time…



Inspections, violations, penalties. By any agency with enforcement responsibility.



National Practitioner Data Base: masked reports on doctor malpractice and discipline,
state by state. You may find cross matches in court records. Public use file withdrawn by
the federal government in Sept. 2011 and most recent files now at
http://www.ire.org/NPDB/



Congressional earmark spending, from Taxpayers for Common Sense
http://www.taxpayer.net/earmarks.php



New York City restaurant inspections. Data is sortable on the government Web site.
http://a816-restaurantinspection.nyc.gov/RestaurantInspection/SearchBrowse.do



Right to Know network includes many databases from federal reports on toxic releases,
spills and accidents, and hazardous wastes. Searchable on site. http://www.rtknet.org/db



Sports stats: www.espn.com ~ www.basketballreference.com ~
http://www.dougstats.com/



Medicare data on nursing homes and more.
http://www.medicare.gov/download/downloaddb.asp



Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, List of
Excluded Individuals and Entities. (Mike Berens: key data)
http://oig.hhs.gov/exclusions/index.asp



Environmental Protection Agency Enforcement and Compliance History Online
(ECHO) . EPA and state data for 800,000+ facilities. http://www.epa-echo.gov/echo/



US Department of Labor, enforcement. OSHA, Wages, Mines. http://ogesdw.dol.gov/

Think creatively. . . .
. . . . using Google search delimiters. payroll filetype:csv led to New Jersey payroll

http://www.nj.gov/transparency/payroll/data/curr_payroll_file.csv
. . . . Google search filetype:csv site:gov justice led to Recovery Act spending
http://download.recovery.gov/recipient/downloadable_results/StateTotalsByAgency.csv

An investigative state of mind. . . .
. . . . so search for filetype:csv site:agency-you-cover . . . . CSV or TSV or DBF
. . . . and use FOIA aggressively to probe for records in electronic format. Especially the $$$.
