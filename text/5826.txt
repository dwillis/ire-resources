Here’s how internet warfare works.

A group calling itself the
CyberCaliphate hacks the
Albuquerque Journal, defacing the
newspaper’s website.
“You'll see no mercy infidels,” they
write on Christmas Eve 2014.
“With Allah's permission we begin
with Albuquerque.”

Hours later, dozens of Twitter accounts swing into action, amplifying news of the
alleged terrorist cyberattack. Soon, they’re leaving out the word cyber, spreading
an even more ominous message.
“I’m scared.”
“ISIS terrorists live
among us!”
“Our government
can’t provide our
security.”
“Mexicans help them.”

The message: Brazen ISIS has penetrated
the heartland, and America’s leaders are
helpless.
“It’s all Obama’s fault!” wrote one
account, using the hashtags
#ImmigrationAction and #ISISattacks.

RT picks it up. Just the facts: American media outlets hacked by a
group claiming to be ISIS. The FBI is investigating.

Some security pros mutter it doesn’t make
sense. They’ve never heard of
CyberCaliphate, and it isn’t ISIS’s MO.
But news of the hack has spread, and the
CyberCaliphate goes on to hack other
targets, including the U.S. military’s Central
Command Twitter account.

The ISIS cyber army is here!

Except it’s not ISIS, according
to British intelligence, who
this October published a
report saying CyberCaliphate
is just another name for
Russia’s military intelligence
service.

Question: What makes a story about
a cyberattack good?

Specific details. Human drama.
What do people remember
about this landmark NYT story
about the DNC hack?
They remember Yared Tamene,
the DNC tech-support
contractor who didn’t believe
the FBI was really on the
phone.
They remember Charles
Delavan, who, when asked by
John Podesta about a Russian
spearphishing effort, replied
with these now infamous
words: “This is a legitimate
email.”

This can be hard to do in the realm
of nation-state hacking.

And much of what the security
community says seems similarly
inaccessible.

Much of what the
U.S. government
knows is unavailable
to journalists.

Terminology Overload

I’m going to walk through some of the
tools and techniques I and others have
used to try to piece things together. It’s
by no means comprehensive, but it is
what has worked for me.
