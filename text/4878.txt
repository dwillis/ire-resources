Covering Defense Department Weapons Programs
IRE National Conference 2016 New Orleans
Tony Capaccio Bloomberg News acapaccio@bloomberg.net
The Pentagon since September 2001 has spent more than $1 trillion
on weapons procurement and research and development. The money
``has resulted in relatively modest gains in actual military
capability,'' Defense Secretary Robert Gates said in a May 24, 2011
speech as he left office. He called it a ``vexing and disturbing''
reality.
Gates' observations raise a lot of questions for D.C. policy makers
and also for reporters covering the defense industry and weapons
programs in their areas: how well are the contractors performing
and how well do the weapons work?
The Pentagon for fiscal year 2017 is requesting $184 billion for
weapons procurement and research.
So weapons spending remains a ripe area of investigative or even
``how-it-works'' inquiry.
Here are some tips to get you started:
Weapons budgets are projected by the ``Iron Triangle'' of military
services, lawmakers and contractors who often hire consultants and
lobbyists to protect the money. It's useful to cultivate sources in
these areas. The military legislative assistants, or MLA, in each
congressional office of your state are good to know.
Overview
First, to get up to speed on current weapons programs you need to
know the major contractors in your state. Start with the listing at
USAspending.gov and run a state profile.
Click On ``Summaries'' FY 2016 to see macro view of defense
spending. You can also sort by agency and ``congressional''
districts to track spending.
The Pentagon Comptroller site since fiscal 2012 lists an excellent
``Overview'' document that explains relatively clearly for DoD the
budget, proposed savings and DoD defense organizations Very useful
document for getting an instant education on military spending.

The next key annual Comptroller document is the ``Program
Acquisition Costs by Weapon System'' book that provides one-page
descriptions of vehicles, ships, tanks, rockets, missiles, aircraft
and satellites, who makes them and the budget request.

The Pentagon also posts online an Atlas/Data Abstract that gives
detailed state breakdowns of military personnel, bases,
contractors. It's really useful as a starting point even through
the current edition is dated FY 2009. Do a Google search to track

The U.S. Government Accountability Office's annual weapons reports
is also a crucial resource:
http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d10388sp.pdf.
It outlines the status of each major weapons program, including
problems and progress. It also gives a snapshot of the current
overall cost of the Pentagon's weapons portfolio
Then check if there is a regional GAO field office. GAO auditors
are good sources of context on defense management and weapons
programs and can give insights into ongoing work and reports near
completion.
They are also free to talk about reports already released:
http://www.gao.gov/about.gao/phonebook/orgphonebook.pdf
Hearings On-line
Congressional hearings accessed on-line through the U.S. Government
Printing Office are valuable for gathering information on status
and problems. The annual ground combat, shipbuilding and aviationspecific hearings of the House and Senate armed services and
appropriations subcommittees often disclose nuggets.
The most valuable hearings have extensive additional ``questions
and answers'' for the record that aren't available until
publication but contain previously undisclosed information.
Defense market analyst Byron Callan of Capital Alpha Partners LLC
has put together a very useful ``Defense Primer'' that covers
markets, companies and the defense budgeting process, He is willing
to share the document, prepared for clients, on request.
Email him at Byron.callan@capalphadc.com. Phone is 202-527-0277. He
published a new version last month.
Also review the last year's worth of earnings call transcripts
companies post, or you can get from Bloomberg News if you are a
Bloomberg News subscriber. The calls give a great sense as to the
importance of a system to company revenue. They also give a list of
analysts to call.
Test Reports, Oversight
The Pentagon's Director of Operational Test and Evaluation
publishes an annual report on weapons testing status that for years
has been almost impossible to obtain. The Pentagon after the Sept.
11, 2001 attacks pulled the report from its website, citing
security issues. It's been released in hard copy over the years and
occasionally defense think tanks have obtained and posted the
copies.
The threat has passed and the document is now online.
http://www.dote.osd.mil/pub/annrep.html. The reports now are posted
from 1999. They are invaluable for tracing the history of missile

defense testing and information on systems currently in use
overseas such as the Navy's Littoral Combat Ship.
If your area is heavy with defense contractors see if the Defense
Contract Management Agency, or DCMA, has a field office or
representative in a major defense facility at DCMA.mil. DCMA now
has a FOIA reading room where it has posted monthly reports it's
released on the F-35 fighter program at
http://www.dcma.mil/dcmahq/FOIA/reading_room.cfm
The agency also issues Corrective Action Requests to defense
contractors on a Level 1-4 basis, with 4 being the worst. The
agency will often confirm in response to a written question through
its Public Affairs office whether a company has any pending CARS
and the nature of the violation. This year we broke several stories
on unresolved quality issues with major programs based on DCMA
input, including ``U.S. Navy Dings Lockheed On Its Littoral Ship
Quality Controls.''
The PA is Mark Woodbury 804-734-1492 or dcmapublicaffairs@dcma.mil
The Pentagon Inspector General is a major source to be aware of and
mine -- both published reports and those released under FOIA and
posted in its FOIA reading room. Contact its PA Bridget Serchak -bridget.serchak@dodig.mil for information on signing up for email
alerts. The agency also posts a helpful monthly newsletter on he
first of each month that outlines reports to be published over the
next 30 days.
The semi-annual report published twice a year is worth skimming,
especially for its listing of audit reports and investigations
performed by the Army, Navy and Air Force investigative services.
Costs
You can track the cost of major weapons by checking the Selected
Acquisition Reports, or SARS, published annuallyt:
http://www.acq.osd.mil/ara/am/sar. The summary annual compilation
includes how much Congress has approved to date and total cost in
inflation-adjusted dollars.
The detailed reports going back several years on which the
summaries are based are on line now at:
http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/Reading_Room/Selected_Acquisition_
The latest SARS released in March are now on-line. This is valuable
resource. I used SARs going back several years to disclose that the
Navy's DDG-1000 destroyer, finally delivered last month, was at
least three years behind the original date.

Unsung Documents
Service magazines and affiliated organizations put out annual
editions that give good descriptions of weapons programs. These
include the Almanac editions of Seapower, Air Force Association and
Association of the U.S. Army.
Here's a list of military journals in your area of coverage. Check
out: http://www.au.af.mil/au/aul/periodicals/dodelecj.htm
Sometimes the most obscure Pentagon budget documents yield a tip.
Case in point are ``Reprogramming'' documents that spell out when
the Pentagon wants to shift funds. Several years ago I spotted the
mention in a reprogramming request to shift funds to buy more
Boeing `Scan Eagle' drones for counterterrorism operations.
Reprogramings are listed on the Pentagon Comptroller website at:
http://comptroller.defense.gov/execution/reprogramming/
I was able to track details of Navy SEAL use of the Boeing drone by
reading the Navy Special Warfare magazine Ethos:
http://www.navsoc.navy.mil/pdf/Ethos/ETHOS_ISSUE_7.pdf
I was then able to arrange an interview with a SEAL drone operator
quoted in the story and get official comment from the U.S. Central
Command.
It resulted in the July 19, 2009 story entitled ``Boeing Drones
Play Pivotal Role in War on Taliban, Al-Qaeda.''
The Comptroller site also lists so-called Budget Justification
books issued by each service the budget.
They are listed under the ``Links to Budget Materials'' section of
the Comptroller page:
http://comptroller.defense.gov/Budget2017.html
I have used the book for the Missile Defense Agency ``Procurement''
to track production delays with Lockheed Martin's new Thaad antimissile interceptor for the U.S. Army by comparing the delivery
schedules listed over a two or three year period.

It resulted in a story on ``Lockheed Delay On Interceptor Slows
Mideast Defense.''

I also plowed through the ``Counter-Terrorism Technologies''
project description in the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, or
DTRA, justification book. It supports the secret commando mission
to detect and dismantle weapons of mass destruction.
DTRA's research budget book is on the Comptroller website under
``Budget Materials.';

The books are also useful for piercing the veil of secrecy
