Tracking the stimulus in your community

The federal stimulus package affects nearly every community in the country, which means that tracking how the money
is spent is critical. For newsrooms, the stimulus touches nearly every beat from housing to transportation to technology.
Every reporter should become familiar with what stimulus money is on their beats.
Here are some key questions to answer:
What money is going to your community? From which federal program is your community receiving money. Which
category of money is highest in your area? That will help you focus your reporting.
Evaluate how the money is being spent:
1. How is the money distributed?
2. Who is getting contracts?
3. What’s being fixed?

EXAMINING HOW THE MONEY IS SPENT
With so much money going out the door so quickly, it would be easy for some bad apples to slip into the program. You
may want to background check some of the folks who are getting contracts in your area. Here are some sites to check:
• Disbarred federal contractors: Check to see if companies have had problems with federal contracts.
(www.epls.gov/epls/search.do )
• OSHA: Check a company’s safety record (www.osha.gov) Data also is available from IRE/NICAR
• California contractors search: ( www2.cslb.ca.gov/OnlineServices/CheckLicense/NameRequest.asp)
• Better Business Bureau (www.bbb.org)
You also can check on the ground. Go to the job site and check:
• Whether the project is actually up and running
• The number of workers
• Who the subcontractors are – check truck IDs or licenses
Evaluating projects
• Federal bridge inspections – available from IRE
• Dam inspections data – available from IRE, and national inventory of dams
(https://rsgis.crrel.usace.army.mil/apex/f?p=397:12:2683886824750510)
• Census data
o To adjust spending to per capita
o to examine spending against demographics of your community
• Bureau of Labor Statistics – for unemployment information (www.bls.gov)
Getting demographic information
• Census data: (Factfinder.census.gov )
o Use population estimates to get overall population
o Use the American Community Survey for other variables
• California – State Census data center: (www.dof.ca.gov/research/demographic )
• Regional government organizations
