Compare and contrast
●
How does your state/entity compares to others? Is there a sexual harassment
policy? When was the last time it was updated?

●
Is there mandatory sexual harassment training? Is it done online or in person?
Investigating decades-old claims
● In absence of absolute proof of allegations, you can still rely on documents and
interviews to test credibility. Did the person live where they said they did at the
time? Does their timeline make sense? Do they know details of the alleged
abuser’s life? Are there police or other records linking them to a related address
or name?
● When tracing connections, don’t overlook microfiche newspaper libraries,
including family obituaries. They’ll list extended relatives, and often where they
lived at the time.
Facing challenges
●
Focus on task ahead
●
Find a mentor
●
Don’t look too far into the future and don’t root for an outcome.
●
Don’t worry about the potential fallout from your work - concentrate on what you
can control: your story
