governments detain
journalists.

What I’ll cover

• Keeping email private
• Encryption/decryption programs
• Keeping your computer clean
• Tricking keyloggers

Private internet searching
• AOL debacle: 36 million search terms of

650,000 users (http://www.aolstalker.com/)
• Subpoenas to Google, your IT department
or ISP
• Alternative: www.ixquick.com: No IP
addresses kept, search terms deleted
within 48 hours

Torproject.org
• TOR enables anonymous

browsing

services -- $10/60 minutes
• PhoneGangster.com iPhone app

gathered by NSA
• GPS-equipped cellphones
track your location
• Cellphones also track
location by cell tower
triangulation
• Cellphones and wireless
phones can be heard by
scanners
• Cellphones can be bugged

Cellphone spyware

extract SMS,
view photos,
read call logs
($137)

Pre-paid “burner” cell phones
• No-contract cell phones: Buy

with cash, and replenish with
cash

Verizon, T-Mobile, Virgin
Mobile

door…

Keeping identity private in email
• Use free “throwaway” email addresses from

Yahoo, etc.
• (But remember Petraeus and Broadwell.)
• Anonymizer.com: This will help.
• Use the Tor Browser Bundle along with the
anonymous email account.
• Lots of remailers – chain them

Smuggling your text and pictures
• Use micro SD

cards
• Up to 64 GB

Cryptography
• Use code to make files on

disk, phone, etc., unreadable
• Avoid simple ciphers, onetime pads, etc.
• Public-key cryptography is
best
• TrueCrypt.org:
• Open source; no back door
• Plausible deniability with hidden

volume

• GnuPG.org also open source
• Keep data on encrypted

thumb drive

Email encryption
• MS Outlook will encrypt

email
• Better: GnuPG 2.0

Shift lines, text and/or characters; deliberate
misspellings, etc.
