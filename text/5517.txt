Dear Mr. Jeter:
I hope this letter finds you well. My name is Cheryl W. Thompson and I, like
you, lived on Chicago’s South Side. In fact, I grew up, went to school and had
some of my best times there. I currently work as a reporter for The Washington
Post newspaper in Washington, D.C., I’m writing because I’d like to tell your
story and how the shooting of Trooper Scott Patrick has affected you and altered
your life. I know you expressed remorse at your trial and apologized publicly to
his family, and if you could go back to that December, perhaps you’d do things
differently.
I really think that telling your story could help others and possibly prevent
them from making similar mistakes.
Thanks so much for taking the time to read this letter. I look forward to
meeting you soon.
Sincerely,

Cheryl W. Thompson
