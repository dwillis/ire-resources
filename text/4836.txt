Threat Modeling
• Enumerating the risks involved for
a user or business, and ways to
mitigate those risks

• Simplified version: the

who/what/where/when/why/how of
thinking about security & risk.

Threat Modeling
• Who are your enemies?
• Why might you be targeted?
• What might be used against you?
• What could go wrong in your dayto-day?

• How secure do you need it?

Data in motion. Communication! Calls,
messages, files sent; anything out of
your hands.

Metadata. Who are you talking to &
when. How big are those files/msgs?

Identities & logins.

Help is on the way

Mobile tools: Secure calling and
messaging
Web browsing:
-More encryption & malware blocking.
-Anonymous browsing
Messaging: Secure chats and video
calls
E-mail & file encryption

Software updates
Security holes in Windows, Mac, and
Linux, are discovered on a near-daily
basis. Same with browsers and most
other software.
(When it annoys you to restart &
update, just do it!)

Passwords
Don't use the same couple of
passwords everywhere.
Your e-mail password needs to be
stronger than your bank’s. (At least
you can call up your bank for help if
there’s fraud. Not so much w/e-mail.)
E-mail owns your other accounts —
nearly every website has an “I forgot
my password” feature that e-mails you.

Passwords

An 8 letter password with numbers and
symbols can be cracked in a few days,
but an 8 word phrase could take
centuries.
“Pass phrases” – use a real sentence
instead of just one word. Google and
Twitter (& many others) let you use a
password as long as you want!
Unfortunately, websites don't always
let you do this.

Password Managers
Helps you use a different password
everywhere.
Can generate totally random
passwords for every website.
1Password (Mac/iOS/Windows)
LastPass (multiplatform, website)
KeePassX (multiplatform app)

Two Factor Login
• Helps keep an account secure, even if
your password is stolen.

• First factor: “something you know”
(your password)

• Second factor: “something you have”
(your phone)

• You (or an evildoer) need both to get into
your accounts.

• Google has it, Yahoo has it, Twitter,
Facebook, Dropbox, lots of banks.

Two Factor Login

Secure deletion
• When you delete a file from your

computer, you’re only deleting it from
the “table of contents” of your drive.

• Data still there until something else

needs to use those unused “pages.”

• A “secure” delete writes random data
into the place where the file was.

Secure deletion
●

Erasing files:
“Secure Empty Trash” on Mac:
hold ⌘ key when right-clicking Trash.
●
CCleaner (Windows)
●

●

Erasing free space (to wipe files that you
didn’t erase securely):
Disk Utility (Mac)
●
CCleaner (Windows)
●

File encryption
• Protects files
• Use case: sending sensitive files or

putting files on USB sticks to share.

• TrueCrypt (multiplatform)
• MiniLock (multiplatform)

Full disk encryption
• Protects all data on your computer, when
computer is turned off.

• Use case: Protects if computer is stolen
• Apple FileVault (Mac)
• BitLocker (Windows “Pro” or “Enterprise”
versions)

Tor
• Anonymized internet access so websites

don’t know where you are
●
Great for research so websites don’t know
you visited them & your ISP doesn’t know
either.

• Sends your traffic through volunteer relays
before trying to access the website

• Caveat:
• Relays may see your browsing (if not

HTTPS), since they are relaying it on
behalf of you. (Be careful with logins!)

Tor
PC/Mac: https://www.torproject.org/
iOS: Onion Browser (disclosure: I work on
this)
Android: Orbot

Encrypted Chat: OTR
• “Off The Record” encryption protects

messages between you and someone else.
●
Not the same as Google “Off The Record”
mode

• Use an existing account (like GChat or

others) & use an OTR plugin to encrypt.
●
You can register an account at
other chat services too, to avoid Google
knowing about your chats.

• Caveats:
• Metadata – who you are talking to and

when – is still seen by the chat service.

OTR Encryption

Encrypted Chat: OTR
●

●

Tor Messenger provides OTR encryption and
lets you use accounts on many messaging
services (Google Chat, Twitter DMs,
XMPP/Jabber).
●
In addition to OTR, it uses Tor to mask
your IP address.
ChatSecure does most of the same things
for iPhone and Android.

Encrypted Chat: Ricochet

●

●

Ricochet uses Tor to provide an encrypted
chat connection directly to your contact.
Decentralized service, no registration
required; authors of Ricochet do not see
messages or metadata.

Encrypted Chat: Ricochet

Encrypted Texts
• Signal (iOS & Android)
• Threema & WhatsApp (iOS & Android) are also
popular and have end-to-end encryption.

• iMessage (iOS) claims to encrypt messages,

but Apple sees metadata and may have access
to the messages.

Encrypted Calls
• Signal (iOS & Android)

Voice calls on your phone
Jitsi Meet (PC/Mac)
●

•

●

Video conference calls, like Google
Hangout or Skype. In your web browser.

• FaceTime (iOS): Like iMessage.
●

Prevents cell provider from knowing
who you call. But again, Apple may
have access to the metadata and
actual call.

PGP: Encrypted email
Also known as GPG — for “GnuPG”,
one of the programs that does this
You get a public and private key, you
have to download someone's public
key before you can send them an
encrypted message.
Historically hard to set up and use.

PGP

• Mac:

Thunderbird+ Enigmail
or GPGTools + Mail app

• Windows:

Thunderbird+ Enigmail
or GPG4Win + Outlook

• Setup guides:

Hacks/Hackers NYC
Freedom of the Press Foundation
Security in a Box

But what about
other tools?

• New tools come out all the time.
• We don’t necessarily know what’s

secure. Follow a lot of security experts
to see what their consensus is.

• Consider the encryption, metadata-

masking capabilities, and transparency
of how tools work:
