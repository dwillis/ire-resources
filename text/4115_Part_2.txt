NICAR 2014

Boston Bombings
• Running down leads
• Save your best stuff before it becomes
garbage, or taken down, or overloaded.
• Think about your subject when trying to
identify friends and associates.
• Dhokar Tsarnaev went to a huge school
making it harder to find classmates who knew
him. How do you find them then?

Twitter
• Use topsy to search on subjects or people
• Twitter’s advanced search also works well
• http://twitter.com/search-advanced
• Use favstar.fm to see old tweets. (only saves
favorited tweets)
• Breaking news: Save followers and following
before the world starts following your subject.

Scribd can help you find people who
KNOW your subject

EDWARD SNOWDEN
• Although Edward Snowden identified himself
and told us where he had lived before he left
the United States, the normal public records
were not useful in locating him and associates.
• He didn’t want the story to be about him but
his story was too good to not pursue.

Lindsay Mills

Use LinkedIn to Find Sources

Use Whois and Checkdomain
• Phone numbers and current addresses listed
for primary officers of the company

Finding friends

Social Networks Vary
• Facebook (privacy settings becoming more
difficult)
• Twitter (for media types and breaking news)
• Instagram (adults make up lives in Instagram,
kids are taking pictures of their real lives)
• Soundcloud (people use their real names
here. Often a good jumping off point to get to
their other networks.
