Tips for investigating caregivers

1. Read legal notices. There's some crazy stuff in
there
2. "No" means YES! -- If they are denying something
that should be public, they probably have something
to hide. When the county said no, we went to the
state and feds.
When county hospital administrators shut us down,
we went to the nurse's union and other workers
there.
When the woman's guardian refused to talk, we got
her supervisor who did.
3. How was it supposed to work? Hospital or nursing
home charter probably doesn't say we are going to
put a vulnerable person with the mental acuity of a
3rd grader next to a guy who punches out male
nurses and sexually assaults others.
4. Mother knows best -- find family members to talk
about what the people were like as kids. That
humanizes them so they are not just a number -shows the promise they once had. You have to make
readers care about the victims.

5. Get the salaries of the people in charge. Few
things piss off readers more than officials getting
fat off of the misery of others.
(We found record amounts of overtime.)
