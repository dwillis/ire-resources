The Federal Register (searchable database covering 1994-the present)
http://www.access.gpo.gov/su_docs/aces/aces140.html
The Federal Register is the official daily publication for rules, proposed rules, and notices of federal
agencies and organizations, as well as executive orders and other presidential documents.
The Records and Information Management System of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
http://rimsweb1.ferc.gov/rims.q?rp2~intro
American's energy industry has supposedly been "deregulated," but the volume of dockets available on this
site proves that recent changes would be more properly described as re-regulation. On this site, you can
find annual reports of utilities, which include a wealth of information about their activities, as well as
descriptions of projects energy companies hope to build.
The U.S. Department of Transportation Docket Management System
http://dms.dot.gov/search/
This site tracks documents of the various agencies within the DOT, including the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration. You can not only read about proposed
rules and regulations here, but also can listen in as corporations and citizens weigh in on the policies.
Dealing with data trapped in Adobe Acrobat documents.
The link below will take you to a tipsheet with step-by-step instructions for using the Aerial plug-in to
extract data from Acrobat documents.
