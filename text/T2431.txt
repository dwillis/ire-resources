-- Advocacy organizations: Two key sites run by advocates are those of SprawlWatch Clearinghouse
(http://www.sprawlwatch.org/) and Smart Growth America (http://www.smartgrowthamerica.org. Both
offer good material, including an e-mail clipping service at the latter.
You can also find some material at the web sites of national environmental groups that have taken up
this issue, including the Natural Resources Defense Council
(http://www.nrdc.org/cities/smartGrowth/default.asp) and the Sierra Club
(http://www.sierraclub.org/sprawl). The Surface Transportation Policy Project also does transportationrelated sprawl studies (http://www.stpp.org).
For libertarian and property rights perspectives, see the Cato Institute’s papers at
http://www.cato.org/research/nat-studies/population.htmland abundant work from the Reason Public Policy
Institute at http://www.rppi.org/urban/index.html. If you spend much time in this field you’ll run across a
constellation of like-minded libertarian think tanks and opinion shops that have stepped into this debate,
including the Heartland Institute in Chicago,(www.heartland.org), the James Madison Institute in Florida
(http://www.jamesmadison.org ), the Buckeye Institute in Ohio (http://www.buckeyeinstitute.org , the
Thoreau Institute in Oregon (http://www.ti.org).
-- Academic research: A collection of papers that attempt to define sprawl’s many aspects can be found
atWayne State University’s College of Urban, Labor and Metropolitan Affairs
(http://www.culma.wayne.edu/sprawl/papers.htm). George Hess of North Carolina State University and
students built a useful bibliography and downloadable worksheets as part of a course that ranked 49 MidAtlantic urban areas using seven factors (http://courses.ncsu.edu/for610v/common/). And the
Transportation Research Board, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences, created a sprawl measure in
2001 based on counties as parts of economic areas, broad areas defined by the federal Bureau of Economic
Analysis. The analysis is interesting in part because it uses data from 1980-2000 and projections for 2000
to 2025. (http://trb.org/news/blurb_detail.asp?id=608).
There are several all-purpose urban research sites worth exploring for readable work on sprawl. Several
studies commissioned by the Brookings Institute in Washington delve into the details of office sprawl
((http://www.brookings.edu/es/urban/officesprawl/report.htm), the dense sprawl of South Florida
(http://www.brookings.edu/es/urban/publications/langmiami.htm), the unbalanced north-south development
that’s exacerbating sprawl around Atlanta (http://www.brookings.edu/es/urban/atlanta/toc.htm) and density
trends from 1982-97 in metros around the country
(http://www.brookings.edu/es/urban/publications/fulton.pdf).And at the Metropolitan Institute at Virginia
Tech (www.mi.vt.edu), director Robert Lang and colleagues offer several interesting studies and a blog,
BlogOPolis. (http://mivt.blogspot.com). One recent study by Arthur Nelson and Thomas Sanchez rates the
effectiveness of natural and human barriers to sprawl in the 35 largest U.S. metros
(http://www.mi.vt.edu/uploads/Exurban_Boundaries_March05.pdf).
-- Others:The USA TODAY Sprawl Index, devised in 2000, ranked every metro on a simple scale that
focused on the share of the metro’s population living inside a Census-defined core area called the urbanized
area. It used 1990 and 1999 population data and showed that natural forces, like availability of water, and
cultural factors like segregation shape sprawl as much as government: sprawl.usatoday.com.
