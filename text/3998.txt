Analysis of SEC documents

Most US public companies are required to file regular financial statements with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
Key filings include:

10-K (annual report). Includes key employees, financial tables, property, litigation, risk factors and more
10-Q (quarterly report). Quarterly financial tables, plus info on new litigation and other developments
8-K (special events). Usually shorter filings covering breaking news, such as a major contract or new CEO
DEF 14-A (proxy – shareholder report). Includes info on board members, exec pay and shareholder
initiatives

S-1 (Initial public offering). Filings by firms going public for the first time, as well as new stock offerings
Form D (stock sale by private firm). Some private companies must file limited info when raising money
13-F (Holdings by money manager). Some major investors must disclose holdings once a quarter
Filings available at www.sec.gov (click on “more search options” on top right hand corner)
Can also search past four years of filings by key word
 Can use Boolean operators like AND, OR and NOT (They must be in uppercase!)
 Put exact phrases in quotation marks
 Can use * as a wildcard.
 Use NEAR to find words near each other (Example: Steve NEAR2 Jobs will find Steve
within 2 words of Jobs)
 If you get too many hits, try excluding certain forms or just focusing on key forms like
the 10-K or DEF 14-A
