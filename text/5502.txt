Data & documents
state of mind

Know the law
●

Read your state’s public records law, the attorney general opinions, key
legal cases that have shaped the law. Know the key portions well.

●

Understand what fees agencies can and cannot charge.

●

If you request a record, do it informally first.

●

Ask to just look at records before you decide what to copy.

Avoid the data dance
■

Don’t be put off by lingo: Excel, Access, text files, .dbf, comma delimited,
tab delimited, Oracle, SQL server. It’s all data you can use.

■

Collections of archived pdf files can be turned into manageable data,
usually within a few steps.

■

You can create your own data (if you have to) from paper records.

■

Think about pieces of information on paper forms as fields.

Avoid the data dance
■

Look for paper documents with information in neat columns and rows.

■

If the information looks like it came from a computer, it exists
somewhere in a computer. The trick is to find it.

■

Get a blank input form to see what they collect. Ask if you’re getting all
fields of data.

■

Ask for as many years of data as you can get.

Avoid the data dance
●

If you don’t know what data they keep, they ask you what you want and
you get only that.

●

If you only ask the person at the top, who may be a techno-phobe, you
could end up getting a pile of paper printed out from a computer.

●

Top-level executives rarely know how the data is kept, what is in it or
how to get it out of the computer. They get pretty paper reports.

Interview officials who use the data
■ Find everyone on your beat who asks for and uses reports created with
computerized data -- the end users.
■ What kinds of routine reports does your agency create? How often?
■ What specific information is contained in these reports? (Blank forms!)
■ Are they required by law to keep certain reports? Can employees ask for
them?

Interview officials who use the data
■

Ask who creates them? Try to get more than “our IT department.” Get
names of the people in IT responsible for key reports.

■

Carry a flash drive or external hard drive with you so officials can just
hand over the database.

■

Ask whether the agency has changed anything about the data over time.
Did they add new fields? Stop collecting some types of data?

What to ask for …
■

You don’t want their software, only the data out of the computer.

■

Ask for a text file (.txt) or a tab- or comma-delimited file. This is a
universal format almost any program can use and almost any program
(yes even theirs) can spit out.

■

Request a field list that will tell you how the database is structured.

What to ask for …
■

Request a code sheet, that will tell you what is in coded data. Example:
1=male and 2=female.

■

Request the same or similar records from multiple sources.Then you’ll
have a more complete picture.

■

FOIA the log they keep showing how they’ve responded to records
requests.

Get data before you need it …
■ Organize ongoing, baseline data:
■
■
■
■
■
■

School test scores
Government budgets
Contracts & spending
Payroll records
Crime records and arrest data
Election results

■ Source lists

Records to request regularly …
■ The whole packet that board members or councilors get, not just the
agenda;
■ Minutes of meetings you couldn’t make;
■ Inspections of any major facilities in your community … nursing homes,
day-care centers, hospitals, jails etc.;
■ Jail log;
■ Police blotter.

Strategies …
●

If you’re denied:
○

Ask agency to put the denial in writing & cite the law they’re relying
on to withhold the record.

○

Ask for redacted records but don’t set new precedents about what
can be withheld.

○

If the agency is clearly violating the law, isn’t that a crime?
Consider reporting it!

Strategies …
●

If you’re denied:
○

FOIA email between officials who processed your request.

○

Consult an attorney or a FOIA group (RCFP is a good one!)

○

Sue!

○

Contact attorney for the agency.
