PETER KARL TIP SHEET

Get out of your chair and get onto the street!
Documents are not only a great source to protect you legally but they are a great resource
to develop sources for your stories. They humanize your story take advantage of that.
Once you get the names, go talk to them, they may give you incredible insight.
Go to the scene of the crime and see if what is alleged or reported can really happened the
way it is described in a police report or court document!
Never forget how important a phone book can be as an investigative tool!
Don’t try to manipulate information. Facts are FACTS! Report what you find, not what
you thought you would find!
The best stories are those that demonstrate good - vs – evil!
The motives behind the best stories are Sex, Money and Ego!
Don’t complicate your story, keep it simple!
Avoid minor mistakes, they can challenge your credibility, both in your story and if you
ever have to go to court!
Never ever assume anything!
Take the time to prepare for your TARGET interview and practice your questions, be
prepared, you might only get the one shot at the interview. Determine before hand what
is the most important thing that you need when you walk away!
Always give the target of your investigation an opportunity to talk with you they may
make a good story GREAT!
When dealing with the police you can get more information by using honey than you can
by using vinegar!
Don’t try to write your story before your investigation is complete. You are just wasting
your time!
Great investigations write themselves!
If it sounds to good to be true, it ain’t!
IT’S NOT BECAUSE I AM SO SMART BUT BECAUSE THEY’RE SO STUPID
