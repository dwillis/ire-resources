Introduction
The first dot to be connected regarding the bailout is the collapse of the real estate market, which was
due largely to the subprime lending boom. Then came the bailout, which included the creation of the
Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and several much more significant lending and asset purchase and
guarantee programs by the Federal Reserve. With this tip sheet, we hope to point out a few Web sites
and datasets that will spark story ideas, or at least inform stories you are already writing.
Subprime lenders
http://www.huduser.org/datasets/manu.html
We may have missed something, but the only official list of subprime lenders we were able to find is
published by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. It is a good list, but beware – it lists
lenders that are (or were) primarily engaged in subprime, not big lenders that did a little subprime
business. Best part, you can get multiple years.
http://www.ffiec.gov/hmda/hmdaproducts.htm AND http://data.nicar.org/catalog/9
The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) requires most lenders to report details from mortgage
applications. By using the HUD list and the HMDA data, you can track subprime lending down to the
neighborhood level. What we used to determine “subprime” was a column called the “spread” which
indicated a high‐interest loan. HMDA data is not free, but can be purchased at a reasonable fee from the
Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council or the National Institute for Computer‐Assisted
Reporting. Also, search the IRE Resource Center tip sheet database for help using HMDA data.
http://www.publicintegrity.org/investigations/economic_meltdown/
This is a link to the Center for Public Integrity’s report on the subprime mess, relying on the HMDA data.
In it we calculate the 25 biggest subprime lenders from 2005 through 2007. The report notes that at
least 21 were financed by banks that received bailout money. We also note 11 of the lenders on the list,
including four recipients of bank bailout funds, have made payments to settle claims of lending abuses.
(More on how to find enforcement actions later.)
Bailout cash
http://www.financialstability.gov/
This is the Treasury Department’s super‐duper site, where you can find information on all its programs
in one place, more or less.

http://www.financialstability.gov/latest/index.html
This is the link to Treasury’s page that lists the latest transactions involving the TARP. These transactions
(mostly stock purchases from banks) happen often, almost on a daily basis. The page is a giant PDF and
tough to work with.
http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/recentactions.htm
I’m not even going to try to sketch out how many different programs have been put in place by the
Federal Reserve System – but go here and you can learn about them for yourself, dating back to
September 2008.
http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/
This is the weekly look at the Federal Reserve’s financial condition, if you can figure out how to read it.
This is where we learn how the central bank’s trillions of dollars worth of lending programs and asset
guarantees are doing. This report is released weekly and is generally followed only by hard‐core Fed
geeks.
http://bailout.propublica.org/
If you don’t have time to learn to speak Treasury, ProPublica has done a lot of the work for you. The site
has many good bailout breakdowns as well as original reporting.
http://www.subsidyscope.com/
Subsidyscope, funded by the Pew Charitable Trusts, is also tracking bailout cash. Among the most useful
functions on the site is the ability to download that ugly Treasury PDF of recipients into a spreadsheet.
The site continues to add new content.
Banking data
http://banktracker.investigativereportingworkshop.org/
This is the banking project from the Investigative Reporting Workshop at American University. This is a
good place to find out whether any banks in your neighborhood are in trouble. You can also check it
against the HUD subprime list as well as the TARP list.
Enforcement actions
There are several bank regulators and each has its own online database of disciplinary actions against
the banks they regulate.
FDIC:
