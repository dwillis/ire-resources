Phase IV: Putting it all Together
By this point, your reporting is well under way including the data analysis. You’ve
answered early questions on whether the story idea is worth pursuing. You’ve
identified experts and victims and analyzed data. You are ready to take the
story/project home.
ORGANIZATION: Avoid the quicksand:
Writing will be smoother if the following is already done:
1. Keep control of your material during reporting.
• Maintain an updated electronic timeline of key events and developments.
• Source file with correct spellings, titles, phone numbers and e-mails.
• Type up your notes soon after interviews. Find a system that works for you. Many reporters
simply use a Word document with key word headings where they slot key quotes and material
from interviews.
• Process key reports and studies as you read them. Type in key findings (can use the same Word
document that has interview notes).
• If you’re working with another reporter, put your notes in a place that’s accessible (e.g. a
protected folder on a network drive). Locate a filing cabinet you can share for all paper
documents. Avoid anyone keeping documents in personal files.
2. Check and update the reporting outline:
• What are the key threads/topics to explore?
• What questions do you need to answer?
• What data do you need to obtain and analyze?
• Who are the key sources to interview?
• Follow up on Freedom of Information requests for data and documents. Be clear on who is
dogging the data and document requests.
• Set a deadline for initial reporting and data work.
• Use the reporting outline to produce a story outline

3. Produce a refined story budget.
• The more creative energy that you put into this step, the more time you’ll save later in veering
off course during the rest of the reporting, writing and design.
• Story overview. In two or three sentences, what is the focus of the story or series?
• Detailed story budget lines so that upper management, photo and graphics get a full view of the
scope of the story/series.
• List potential graphics, photos and online extras.
• Create a back-out schedule from publication date.
4. Producing a story outline
• Working from the reporting outline, lay out how you want to tell the story.
• Highlight where key facts or interviews are missing.
• Never stop reporting. Some of the best stuff comes in just before publication.
• Talk through with your editor what kind of story you are writing and the storytelling devices it
requires: hard news lead; anecdotal lead; bullets; narrative.
• Pick a structure: beginning, middle, end; anecdotal lead, nut graph, development, kicker ending.
5.

Working with your editor.
• Meet at least once a week; give your editor an update memo on your progress. The information
will allow your editor to manage up getting you the time and resources you need to bring the
project home.
• Make your editor your reporting partner. Share everything you are collecting. The more the
editor knows about the facts and how you got them, the better the editing will be.
• Be clear with your editor on the vision for the story or convince him or her of your point of
view. You will run into trouble if your editor is thinking B1 weekday story and you are
dreaming of A1 investigative Sunday.
• Be sure the editor knows all about the data—what it can tell you and what it can’t. Give the
editor a realistic idea of how much time the data work requires as well as the potential payoff.

6.

Working with another reporter
• Make sure the division of duties is clear
• Trust is a must; sharing too.
• Be there especially for the home stretch. Your partner needs you.
• Be clear on how the writing will occur: each writes sections? Lead writer for voice?
Both writing together seldom works

FORMAT: What goes where?
Think about how the story/series might look in print and online. Not everything needs to go into the
story/stories. That’s a recipe for an overstuffed story that will turn off a lot of readers.
Consider if you have material that might best be understood and conveyed in a:
• Story sequence: Series; Sunday presentation; occasional story
• Key findings box. Readers love these, and they help you focus and organize your story.
• Photo. Use cut lines for supplemental information, not just a rehash of what’s already in the story.
• Graphic. What kind of graphic works best with this information?
• Map. Can we give readers a quick look at a geographic pattern?
• Web presentation: Look up database, map, flash photos. If it’s interactive that’s even better
• Readers services: Online links; reader email or online feedback; reporters answering questions
online

WRITING: Bringing it home
At some point, the reporting fun has to stop and you actually have to put this in the newspaper. Here are
some tips on crafting the story:
• Write as you report. Short nuggets and a few paragraphs here and there can become building blocks
for your stories. It’s critical to write when the feelings, observations and details are fresh.
• Set a deadline for rough drafts of stories. This will help writers and editors see what’s missing and
what hasn’t been nailed down yet. It also can identify additional data work that’s needed.
• Have some sort of outline for your story. It may be as basic as the five key elements you’re
exploring and what order makes the most sense.
• Write in chapters, each with a distinct theme, a mini-lead and mini-closer. Each chapter is linked
together logically to give readers a reason to stick with the story.
• The silver bullet: revision. Most reporters and editors dislike this stage the most but it’s critical to
clarity, accuracy, context and pace.
• Write up your data findings and look for ways to turn them into graphics; justifiy the use of every
number.
• Add a How We Did The Analysis box to explain away from the story where data came from and
how it was done.
• Look for places in the story where you can treat the reader to a narrative interlude.
• Write with authority. What’s the most compelling thing you have to say?
• Get feedback on your final draft from a few others not familiar with the story.
• Use only your best quotes; avoid the tendency to want to quote everyone who helped you with the
reporting.
• Details, details…how did it look, smell, feel, sound? Make connections between what’s in the data
and what’s in the neighborhood.

Writing Plus:
•
•
•
•
•

Edit and re-edit; read it out loud.
Build in time for a final vetting of all facts and data.
Plus time for lawyer review if the story requires it.
Build in time to examine all of the pieces together.
Look for pieces that can run immediately after the main story to keep the issue alive.

Just for Editors:

•

Clear time and attention for the home stretch.
Be sensitive to reporters’ burnout and fatigue.
Help with important things like food for long editing sessions.
Control the schedule to avoid late-night or marathon sessions.
Keep the writing process moving forward by monitoring logjams.
Run interference with upper management and last-minute questions.
Pull out the pompoms to remind beleaguered reporters how cool this story will be in print!
Help triple-check key numbers and findings to put reporters’ minds at ease while they’re writing.
Work tirelessly to help reporters keep ownership of their stories (in their writer’s voice) as they
move through the editing chain.
Build in time for reporters to proof pages (including cutlines, headlines, graphics et al).
