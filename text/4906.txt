Investigating the Regulators
Howard Berkes – NPR Investigations
IRE Watchdog Workshop – Salt Lake City - 2016
1. THEY SAY THEY’RE ENFORCING – MAKE THEM PROVE IT


Seek records of enforcement actions, including investigative reports, citations, incident or
accident reports, civil or criminal complaints, administrative complaints, lawsuits



Seek their data. How do they track what they’re doing? How do they measure their own
performance/effectiveness/efficiency? What’s their paper trail?



Who is watching them? Seek reports, audits and investigations conducted by Inspectors
General, the Government Accountability Office, congressional committees, internal affairs



What’s the actual record? How often do they act? How much do they do? Do violators get
breaks – reduced penalties, settlements, plea agreements – and how much and how often?
Does the agency collect penalties, go to court, file complaints – and how often?



Are rulings, fines, citations, sanctions and judgments enforced?



What data do they use? What data do they not use? What different sets of data do they
fail to associate?



How do they frame their role and how does that limit their scope, focus, approach and
effectiveness?



Who do they interview? Who don’t they interview?



What multiple levels of authority do they have? Do they exercise all the authority they
have?



What data and documents should they have but don’t?



What laws/regulations do they enforce? What don’t they enforce? What’s holding them
back?



Are they doing what the law requires?

2. GET HELP


Find “guides” to the regulatory landscape, complexities, nuances, history, jargon, practices
and data



Find former agency investigators, regulators, inspectors, watchdogs, lawyers and officials



Who does the agency interact with (other agencies, commissions, academics, industry
experts, critics, whistleblowers, watchdogs, lawmakers)

3. WHAT’S THE CONSEQUENCE?


What are the regulated able to get away with? Who benefits and how?



What’s the compliance record? More violations? More injuries? Greater risk?



Who is left unprotected or exposed? Who gets hurt?



What do law and regulations fail to do? Where are the gaps?



What legislation/regulations are pending?

4. WHO CARES? WHAT COULD BE DONE?


What do lawmakers/watchdogs/activists think?



What do top agency officials say?



Who has official oversight and how are they reacting?



Who is and isn’t demanding action and why?

5. HUMANIZE THE DATA AND DOCUMENTS


Measure the human toll



Illustrate the data, and trends in the data, with real world experiences



Consult complaints, cases, lawsuits, attorneys, activists, interest groups, public/legislative
hearings, news stories, agency clients



Verify the claims of the affected (seek and review medical records, legal filings, official
reports, witness statements, contemporaneous notes, recordings, documents, e-mails, etc.)

6. ENGAGE THE TARGET


Share data, methods and findings with the subjects of your investigation. Verify data and
findings. Provide opportunities to correct and comment.

SLIDES
1. Who Regulates?
A. Regulation: A rule of order having the force of law, prescribed by a superior or competent
authority, relating to the actions of those under the authority's control.
2. TAKEAWAY NUMBER ONE - When they say they’re enforcing, make them prove it. Better yet,
check out the enforcement record yourself.
3. TAKEAWAY NUMBER TWO – MINE THAT GOLD. Pursue the data and documents. Some
agencies simply post it on their websites. Some will give it to you if you ask. Some will make you file
FOIA requests.
A. What to look for

–
–

Accident/investigation reports
Accident-injury-fatality data
Violations data
Citations
Civil/criminal complaints
Internal audits/Watchdog audits-investigations
Academics/interest groups/Inspectors General/ Congress/GAO
Enabling legislation – are they doing what the law says they should? (OK opt out)

4. TAKEAWAY NUMBER THREE - Who is watching the enforcers? Academics (Purdue), interest
groups, activists, Inspectors General, Government Accountability Office, Congress – they may have
reports and data. PERUSE THE PERIMETER.
5. Why don’t they regulate?
•
•
•
•
•
•

Too much work – pressing a case is more work. Easier to negotiate away. Inaction is easier
than action.
Too few resources – underfunding, understaffed.
Competing demands
Not a priority
Not enough legal authority – workplace deaths – misdemeanors.
Not enough pressure

TAKEAWAY #4 – Investigate the explanation
TAKEAWAY #5 – Trust but verify
TAKEAWAY #6 – There’s always an excuse. Explore that too.
TAKEAWAY #7 – Humanize the data

6. HUMANIZE THE DATA
