TIPS FOR FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT REQUESTS
It never hurts to ask. Some public officials avoid FOIAs like the
plague and would rather turn over documents than get the lawyers
involved.
Have a FOIA ready just in case. If they turn you down, make
sure that FOIA is ready to go. Hand-deliver it if you can. With a
15-day waiting period (those are business days), you want to get
the clock ticking as soon as possible.
Know what you are looking for. Are you looking for a single
document to support a set of facts in your story or do want to cast a
wider net to look at broader implications of this data? Don’t make
your request so broad that it has no focus, nor so specific that you
miss the big picture.
Think beyond the paper. FOIAs can get you e-mails,
photographs, 911 tapes, surveillance video, etc.
Don’t assume government officials understand the law. Many
don’t. Just because they initially tell you something isn’t public
doesn’t make that so. Make them prove it to you.
Be patient: The law isn’t kind to people working with a daily
deadline. Some requests can take months to hash out, but the
results can make it all worthwhile.
Documentation makes you ironclad.
