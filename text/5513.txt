Mass FOIA Requests
(and how to do them better than me)

Mass FOIA projects
- Two main ways:
- Same request to a bunch of the same kinds of
agencies
- Same request to different types of agencies

Law enforcement data
-

Not a ton of standardization
Kept in all kinds of formats
Stored in databases no one ever uses
Subject to certain records exemptions
Is pretty much like every other variety of
government agency

The approach
-

Check the internets
Call the agency and see if they’ll just turn it over
Familiarize yourself with the state’s laws
File the request
Pester like crazy
????
Profit

Understanding what you can get
-

Every state has different records exemptions
Every state has different legal precedent
That’s cool
But generally speaking there’s discretion
Ask for things that are exempt

The part where you request all of the things
- Ask for the same thing from everyone
- Two ways to send
- Mass email (mail merge)
- Tailored requests with specific legalese
- Automate if you can
- Know your deadlines

The part where you fight for the things
-

The request is a first step
Create an alerts system for deadlines
Pick up the dang phone
USE A SPREADSHEET (or tracker)
Be nice and then get mean
Push for correct format

The part where you don’t get things
-

Some battles are worth fighting
Others are not
Always. Be. Appealing.
Prioritize based on your time
Name and Shame
Apply pressure

All the data is here; now what?
-

Standardize
Pick up the dang phone
Get the collection methodology
Understand that things can change
Do your best
Don’t force it

Stuff you should look out for
-

65,536 rows in Excel
Changing definitions in the data
Changing fields in the data
Definitional issues in general
PDF data
Missing fields

Aftermath
-

Pick your targets
Don’t focus on outliers
Put everything in context
Check legal issues
Talk to experts
Make what data you can public
