Yes, it is easier to cover Washington in Washington, but you still can do a lot of reporting from
afar – thanks to the many federal, nonprofit and other websites. And a phone, of course. For a big list of
websites to help you investigate Washington, check out InvestigateWasington.org.
To get you started, here is a list of websites where you can find and track legislation.
