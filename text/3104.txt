Tips to Finding Aviation Stories
• Be patient when trying to get data
• Be patient when trying to “penetrate” the closed circle of aviation (pilots,
air traffic controllers, government regulators)
• Spend time gaining trust and “making friends” in the industry
• Try different agencies to get same data (eg., TSA may stall but FAA may
cooperate)
• Try local airports to get some data (eg., some airports give the same
information TSA won’t give up)
• Know how to link tables from same database (useful in NASA Aviation
Reporting System)
• Learn how to concentrate on the data that means something. Don’t be
overwhelmed by the massive amount of data that bogs down your story
• Makes contacts with your local Air Traffic Controllers’ Union
• Get to know pilots and other stakeholders in the industry off‐the‐record
before beginning on‐the‐record reporting
• Give yourself crash course in aviation “lingo” Know the language of aviation
(eg., know what a “touch and go” is…hint‐‐it isn’t a sexual harassment
term)
• There are many aspects to aviation. Safety, security, layout of airports,
construction of airports, maintenance, design and construction of planes
themselves. Focus on the issues you wish to explore. Don’t get sidetracked.
But think broadly when beginning your process then focus your story
narrowly
• Remember, a few incidents can mean big problems. This is an industry of
high speed and high risk with many lives at stake at one time. All it takes is
one mid‐air collision and hundreds of people could die
• Think creatively when telling your story. You may not get actual video of a
dangerous event. Don’t let that stop you from telling an important story or
exploring an important issue
