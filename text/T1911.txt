TIPS ON TRACKING TERRORISM CASES
Mark Fazlollah
1). Go to the TRAC site (www.trac.syr.edu) to subscribe. Work through the
process or call TRAC in Washington, 202-518-9000.
2) Select a TRAC program category and make your own data slice. The
most interesting selections are “international terrorism,” or “domestic
terrorism.” There are also categories of terrorism-related financial cases and
those related to anti-terrorism efforts.
3) Choose “prosecutions filed,” or “convictions,” for example, or focus on a
geographic area. That limits the number of cases you need to research.
4) Print the spreadsheets, leave TRAC, and switch to the PACER federal
court data system. PACER is another subscription service.
5) Enter the correct federal judicial district corresponding to the TRAC case
you are seeking.
6) Enter the filing date of the TRAC case in the PACER filing date section.
If you are seeking a case from Jan. 16, 2002, for example, you’ll need to
enter the date 1/16/2002 each of the two spaces listed as “from,” and “to,”
under the filing date. This limits the selection to all cases filed that day.
7) Open each criminal case until you find the one that matches the
characteristics of the TRAC case you are seeking, matching on judge’s
names, prosecutor’s name, criminal charges and sentence. (Hint: start with
the Middle Eastern names of defendants in reviewing cases.) There may be
slight differences in TRAC’s listing of charges and the actual charges
reported in PACER.
8) Get the court paperwork. Contact the prosecutors and defense lawyers in
the case. If the case appears to be wrongly labeled as terrorism, prosecutors
sometimes will explain why the label might have been applied.
9) Don’t be discouraged if you don’t find a case. This search process gets
most cases but it also can miss some.
