Introduction to geocoding!

https://geoservices.tamu.edu/

Most of us have received data at one point or another that
includes addresses. Less often we get fields labeled "latitude" and "longitude."

!

In order to put addresses on a map, any mapping software needs those lat and long coordinates.
The process a computer uses to calculate the coordinates for an address so it can place it on a
map is known as geocoding.

!

As reporters we often deal with hundreds or thousands of addresses at once. Thankfully there are
geocoding services out there that will geocode hundreds or thousands of addresses very quickly,
and plenty will do it for free.

!
Getting your data ready!
!

For this exercise we’ll use a slice of the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) 7a loan data: all
loans for San Francisco in 2013. The file name is sba_sf.txt (dowload it here1). Before importing
data into any program, you should take a look to see how the data are formatted, what
geographic fields you want to map, etc. Open up sba_sf.txt in a text editor, preferably Notepad++
or Sublime Text, something more powerful than Notepad.

https://github.com/eklucas/NICAR-Help/raw/master/geocoding/sba_sf.txt

Here our data happens to be formatted just the way we want it for this exercise: BorrStreet
(borrower street address), BorrCity, BorrState and BorrZip in separate fields. Different geocoders
require different formats, so it helps to know ahead of time what your data should look like.
Note also that our file is “tab-delimited”, which means that each value in a row is separated by a
tab. There are also no “text qualifiers”, which are usually single or double quotes that surround
text fields.

!

Many times you will get data where the addresses have typos, misspellings, or are missing the
directional prefix (such as N. for North) or the suffix (such as St. for Street). In these cases it is
best to try and do some cleaning before you geocode. If you put garbage in, you get garbage out.

!

It’s also often important to have a zip code; many geocoders will not work or give you bad
results without them. If you didn’t get zip codes, consider whether it’s feasible to put them in.

!
Using Texas A&M GeoServices!
!

Signing up for an account with Texas A&M is simple and will take you only a few minutes.
Once you get an account, you have 2500 free credits to use; 1 credit = 1 address geocoded.

!

If you want to geocode a bunch of addresses all at once, you want to
Batch Geocode. A “batch” is just a bunch of commands or jobs
strung together, in this case geocodes (like a batch of cookies).

!

Once you’re signed in, click to Geocoding icon (globe with pushpins)
and from the options in the left sidebar, choose “Batch Geocoding.”

!

This page outlines the steps we’ll go through to geocode our data:

!
!
!

Click the Start button. On the next page, click “Add New Database,” and then “Upload New
Database.” TAMU allows you to upload either an Access database (.mdb or .accdb) or a
delimited text file (.csv or .txt). We’ll choose “Text delimited” and then click the “Choose File”
button.

Navigate to your desired file, sba_sf.txt. You are familiar with how your text file is structured,
and here is where we tell TAMU the specifics. In this case, our file is tab-delimited, there is no
text qualifier, and there are headings in the first row:

!

Click “Upload.” Once the data is loaded, you will be asked to “Validate Database.” Since we
uploaded a flat file there will be only one table, so click “Validate Table.” Here we can see the
first 10 rows of our data, and TAMU gives us a record count so that we can be sure everything
was uploaded properly. Our record count, 116, is accurate, and the data snapshot looks good.
Scroll below the table until you see this:

!

Click “Geocoding.” This takes us to Step 2, which is just choosing the data we want to geocode.
We only have one table uploaded, so go ahead to Step 3.

!

Here we identify data fields that are pertinent to the geographic information. Match up the
borrower information (the Id field was automatically generated when we uploaded):

!

Leave the rest of the defaults and go to Step 4, leave the defaults and click “Start Process.”
Now stand up and stretch! TAMU is doing all the hard work.

!

You will get an email about the start and finish of the process, but you can also check the status
by clicking “View Process Status.”

!

Since we’re only geocoding 116 addresses, this should go pretty quickly. When it’s done, we’ll
see this:

Checking your results!

!

So, that was the easy part. TAMU has done most of the work up until this point, but we still need
to evaluate the results. The tricky thing about geocoding is that it is far from an exact science,
and almost all geocoders (if not all) make some errors. We need to do a little fact-checking.

!

Thankfully TAMU provides some helpful pointers on its geocodes that can guide us. First, in the
left sidebar, go to “Databases,” then “Current Databases.”

!

Click on the link to “download” the data:

Save it as sba_sf_geocoded.txt so we can tell it apart from our original file.
TAMU adds 27 fields, listed below. We’re mostly concerned with the ones highlighted:

“FeatureMatchingGeographyType” is the type of geography that TAMU used to place the
address. We want our addresses to be placed using “Street Segments” or “Parcels” because they
are fairly exact. If something like “USPS Zip” is used, the lat/long will place the address in the
center of the zip code, and that is probably not where the address actually is. Sometimes the
geography type used can be a county, a state, or even the United States. These geocodes should
be thrown out without question. In some cases if you clean the data a bit you can get more
accurate geocodes.

!

Many times, if a geocoding service can't find an address, it will return the lat and long of the
center of the geographic area you're working in (usually city or state). Another common error is
placing the point at (0,0).

!

A good check is to sort your results by latitude then longitude to check for duplicates all placed
at the same point or at (0,0). If you find some, those addresses might need more work for the
geocoding service to place them correctly.

!

The “Match Score” field gives us a score from 0 to 100, where 100 is a perfect match (in the
eyes of the program). Using match scores below 100 is a judgment call, but be careful with lower
scores. Note, however, that a geocode based on a zip code can still be get a score of 100.

!

Any good geocoder will give you the type of geography an address was match to and the match
score; these are important indicators of the accuracy of the latitude and longitude.

!

You also will want to inspect your results visually. You can do this with any mapping software,
but Google Fusion Tables is a good free option.

!

Checking your results visually can help you identify any addresses that were placed way outside
the boundaries you expected. For example, we would expect all these addresses to be plotted
within the city of San Francisco:

This is the result of importing our data into Google Fusion tables. Here we can visually inspect
our results to make sure that there aren’t stray points out in the water or in a different state or
continent, and we can also click on any of the points to check the data:

When geocoding goes wrong!
!
Doing these integrity checks are very important, so that you don’t miss something like this:

http://www.vox.com/2014/4/21/5636040/
whats-the-matter-with-kansas-and-porn
!

VOX did an analysis of internet porn traffic by getting IP address data from Pornhub.com, one of
the largest internet porn sites, and geocoding the IP addresses. As their title suggests, they found
that Kansas was the home to a crazy amount of porn traffic, and said so. In fact, it wasn’t just
Kansas, it was one city in particular: Wichita.

!

After publishing their results, it came out that Wichita was so off the charts because it is in the
center of the country. When the geocoder couldn’t place the IP addresses exactly, it used the
whole country as its matching geography type and plopped them right in the center of that
geography, right onto Wichita. Vox changed the headline and published a correction at the top of
the story.

Final words!

!

When you get data that contains addresses and you’re tempted to jump straight to the geocoder,
ask yourself a few questions first:

!

1. Why do I want to see these addresses on a map? Will it help me understand the scope of the
data? Are geographic clusters potentially important? Could these locations have a spatial
relationship (close together, far apart, clustered, segregated, etc) that would be meaningful?
2. What does the data look like? Are the addresses neat, containing all the necessary pieces:
prefix (such as N. for North), suffix (such as St. for Street), standardized names (without a
lot of misspellings or typos), a zip code? If its missing one or more of these things, how hard
will it be to clean the data up?
3. How important is the accuracy to the zip code? If you just want to look at your data points
zoomed out at the county or state level, you can accommodate more relaxed geocoding; if a
point is plotted a block or two away from where it should be, looking at the state level that is
not necessarily a big deal. But if you want to really zoom in and see points plotted at the
street level, accuracy is more important.

!

Remember that geocoding is not an exact science and no geocoders will be perfect; diligently
check results and look at all the information available to you to assess how well your addresses
were geocoded.

A note about projections!
!

It would be wrong to write a whole tipsheet on mapping-related things and not talk about projections. If you are
geocoding a dataset with TAMU or another like service and just plotting the points on a Google map, you don’t need
to worry too much about projections. But if you want to join your points with other geographic information of any
kind, projections will become very important.

!

A projection is simply the way cartographers have put a round world on a flat display (either paper or your computer
screen). Think of a round orange peel that you squash flat on the table: there will be gaps in the peel that need to be
accounted for, and distortion is inevitable. There are many different ways to deal with that, and hence many different
projections: Albers, Mercator and Peters, to name a few of the most popular. Mapping software such as Esri’s
ArcGIS will allow you to choose a projection for your map and then convert geographic data to that projection. If
you intend to do that, you’ll need more than this tipsheet. =)
