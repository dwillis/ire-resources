Sources of data and information on oil and gas drilling
State oil and gas agencies:
States are the source for most basic information, location of wells, permitting, waste
disposal, spills and enforcement information. Every state has different information and
stores it differently. Links at the bottom.
FracFocus.org
Run by a private, non-profit consortium of state regulators, industry uses fracfocus.org
to disclose the chemicals it uses in hydraulic fracturing. It can be even more useful to
reporters by providing volumes of water used, and precise, lat-long locations of wells.
This is not an industry-run site, but it is industry supported and industry funded.
FracFocus doesn't make its information easily accessible, though things are changing.
This is a hobbyist computer expert who tries to make the information more accessible.
