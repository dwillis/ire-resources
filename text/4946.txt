Tell me about you!
• Have you ever recorded audio for a story?
(even using a tape recorder for your own
notes counts)
• Have you ever used audio to tell a story?
• Do you listen to news on the radio?
• Do you listen to podcasts?

Make audio a part of your life!
• It’ll force you to leave your desk, get out of
the office, and meet and talk to people face to
face
• You never know when the audio could come in
handy later, whether or not you are an
audio/radio reporter
• It will make you a better storyteller regardless
of medium

Using audio to supplement print: Sold
Out, a new Texas Tribune series

ALWAYS BE RECORDING
• Get the simple interactions – helps introduce
characters
• Example - This American Life: Three Miles

It doesn’t always have to be people
talking
• 911 calls!
• Make your own sound
• Example: Reveal’s story on earthquakes in
Oklahoma

Imagine setting a scene and putting
your listener there, like a movie.
Example: Reveal show, “Bordering on
Insecurity”

Record yourself interacting and asking
questions!
• Example: Reveal and Texas Tribune episode,
“Bordering on Insecurity”

If people won’t talk to you, it can still
make for great audio
• Example: Reveal show, “The religious freedom
loophole”

Breaking down the wonk/numbers
• Good investigations tend to have a lot of
numbers and complicated policy explanations.
That doesn’t mean you have to “dumb them
down” for radio.
• Examples: “Women’s Sports, a Man’s Game”
from Reveal

• How universities make sure enough women
are on their sports’ teams to comply with Title
IV

How some numbers seem like they
might be out of whack
