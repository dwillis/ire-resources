INSTRUCTIONS
1. Show in this report all persons under 18 years of age taken into custody during the month for
committing an offense of the indicated types within the local jurisdiction. (Include those released
without having been formally charged.)
2. The offenses are taken from the uniform classification of offenses and cover all the Part I and Part II
offenses except traffic. In compiling the data, follow definitions of offenses in Uniform Crime
Reporting Handbook.
3. Enter opposite each offense the number of persons taken into custody listing them according to age
and sex of the persons arrested and according to race without regard to sex.
4. Juveniles. For purposes of Uniform Crime Reporting, a juvenile should be counted as "arrested"
when the circumstances are such that if he or she were an adult, an arrest would be tallied. Juveniles
taken into custody should be listed opposite the classification of the offense for which they were taken
into custody. For example, if a juvenile is arrested for committing an offense of larceny he should be
listed opposite the larceny-theft classification on this report, even though the technical charge placed
against him is "juvenile delinquency." Police "contacts" with juveniles where no offense has been
committed should not be scored as arrests. Instances where a juvenile is taken into custody for his
own protection, such as "neglect", and no crime committed, should not be listed as arrests. Enter on
page 1 your disposition of all juveniles arrested. Arrests of persons 18 years of age and over are
tallied on the white Age, Sex and Race reporting form (ucr-12).
5. Race. It should be noted that persons of Mexican birth or ancestry who are not definitely Indian or of
other nonwhite race should be counted as members of the white race. This conforms to the
procedure followed by the Bureau of the Census in compiling race information in a decennial census.
6. Total all columns.

arrests occur. On this form, all are to be reported when they have been determined to have occurred and are bias-motivated,
regardless of whether arrests have taken place.

reported incident.

MONTHLY RETURN OF ARSON OFFENSES KNOWN TO LAW ENFORCEMENT
Arson Definition
The offense of arson is defined by the national Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program to include any willful or malicious
burning or attempts to burn, with or without intent to defraud, a dwelling house, public building, motor vehicle or aircraft,
personal property of another, etc.
Instructions
In Column 2, report all arson incidents which occurred in your jurisdiction and became known to your department during
the month. Use your law enforcement jurisdiction and not fire districts to determine if an arson incident should be scored
on your report. Count all arsons even though the offenses may have occurred in conjunction with violent crimes reported
on the Return A. Include attempts to commit arson. Also, include "unfounded" reports of arson.
In Column 3, include all reports of arson which prove to be unfounded; those reports which prove upon investigation to be
baseless and no offense of arson was committed or attempted.
In Column 4, enter the number of actual offenses of arson. This number is obtained by subtracting the number in Column
3 from the number in Column 2. Include attempts to commit arson.
In Column 5, enter the total number of arson offenses which were cleared by arrest or exceptional means.
In Column 6, enter the number of arson offenses cleared by arrest or exceptional means involving only persons under 18
years of age. This number is included in Column 5 and excludes those situations in which one or more of the persons
involved were 18 years of age or over.
In Column 7, enter the number of arson offenses listed in Column 4 which involve structures (A.-G. only) which were
uninhabited, abandoned, deserted, or not normally in use.
In Column 8, enter the estimated value of property damage for all arson offenses listed in Column 4. Enter zero ($0) if no
property damage.
The UCR Handbook may be used as a guide to preparing this reporting with two exceptions:
1. The hierarchy rule will not apply in this additional report. Any other Crime Index offenses occurring in
conjunction with an arson will be reported on the Return A and the arson will be reported on this
report.
2. If one of the property crimes occurs in conjunction with the arson, the value of the stolen property will
be reported on the Supplement to Return A and the property loss due to fire, smoke, water, or other
damage resulting from the arson will be reported in Column 8 of this report.
Each agency is requested to submit this arson form each month even if there are no arsons or attempted arsons to report.
(In those instances, please submit the form indicating "None" or zero (0) arson offenses.)
Any questions regarding this report may be addressed to Uniform Crime Reporting, Texas Department of Public Safety,
P.O. Box 4143, Austin, Texas 78765, (512) 424-2091.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARING RETURN A
(Instructions in detail are given in the Uniform Crime Reporting Handbook)
1.

All offenses listed on the Return A which occur during the month should be scored whether they become known to the police as the
result of:
a. Citizens' complaints.
b. Reports of police officers.
c. "On view" (pick-up) arrests.
d. Citizens' complaints to sheriff, prosecutor, county police, private detectives, constables, etc.
e. Or otherwise.

2.

The offenses listed in Column 1 are the Crime Index offenses of the Uniform Crime Reporting Program plus the offenses of simple
assault and manslaughter by negligence. Follow the instructions for classifying and scoring as presented in the Uniform Crime
Reporting Handbook. Offenses committed by juveniles should be classified in the same manner as those committed by adults
even though the juveniles may be handled by juvenile authorities.

3.

Adjustments should be made on this month's return for offenses omitted or scored inaccurately on returns of preceding months or
those now determined to be unfounded. Offenses that occurred in a previous month but only became known to you this month
should be scored this month.

4.

Consider all spaces for each classification of offenses in Columns 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The breakdowns for forcible rape, robbery,
assault, burglary, and motor vehicle theft, when added should equal he total for each of these offenses. Do not enter zeros where
no count exists.

5.

Attempts of rape, robbery, assault, burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft are scored on this form.

6.

Column 2: Enter opposite the proper offense classification the total number of such offenses reported or known through any
means. "Unfounded" complaints are included. Attempts are included except in homicide classifications.

7.

Column 3: Enter the number of complaints which police investigation proves to be "unfounded." An "unfounded" offense is a
complaint which proves upon investigation to be baseless or where the offense did not actually occur. Remember that recovery of
property or clearance of an offense does not unfound a complaint.

8.

Column 4: Number of actual offenses. This number is obtained by subtracting the number in column 3 from that in column 2.

9.

Column 5: Enter the total number of offenses cleared during the month. This total includes the clearances which you record in
column 6. An offense is cleared when one or more persons are charged and turned over for prosecution for that offense.
Clearance totals also include exceptional clearances which are explained in the Uniform Crime Reporting Handbook.

10. Column 6: Enter here the number of offenses which are cleared through the arrest, releasing to parents, or other handling of
persons under the age of 18. In those situations where an offense is cleared through the involvement of both an adult and a
person under 18 years of age, count the clearance only in column 5.
11. The grand totals for columns 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are the totals of each of the seven classifications.
12. Tally sheets can be used to maintain a running count of offenses through the month. Totals for the Return A can then be taken
directly from the tally sheet. These tally sheets can be obtained by corresponding with the Uniform Crime Reporting Section.
13. Record the number of law enforcement officers from your department who were killed or assaulted in the line of duty during the
month. If none were killed or assaulted, mark a zero in the appropriate spaces. If an officer was killed or assaulted, complete a
Law Enforcement Officers Killed or Assaulted form for the month of the attack. If no officer was attacked this month, no Law
Enforcement Officers Killed or Assaulted form need be submitted.
14. Any inquiry regarding the completion of this form or the classification and scoring of offenses in Uniform Crime Reporting should be
directed to Uniform Crime Reporting, Texas Department of Public Safety, Austin, Texas 78765 by attaching a note to this form with
a return address, or by calling (512) 424-2091.
15. Any contributing police agency that desires to submit crime data on a computer printout should contact Uniform Crime Reporting,
by mail or telephone prior to beginning this type of submission.
