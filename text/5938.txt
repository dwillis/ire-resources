IRE 2019 Driveway Moments: ​The art of long-form audio narrative
Getting the tape you need, want, and desire
Jen Chien, Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting
Tape you ​need​: Gives information
Tape you ​want​: Sets the scene
Tape you ​desire​: Brings emotion to the storytelling
How to get all three when you go out to record?
Who
* Are your sources compelling to listen to (not just traditional “good talkers”)? Pre-interview to
find out.
* Think about the function of your sources, but be wary of oversimplification (watch out for that
classic “victim, villain, hero” trap).
* Will you be a character, too?
What
* Record all the incidentals: greetings, entrances, exits, warm-up questions, stand-ups.
* Prep but don’t over-prep for “story” interviews (don’t pre-interview the life out of a
story/source).
* Over-prep for accountability interviews. Have all findings at your fingertips. Practice.
When
* When are things happening? Go then. Ask your sources if you don’t know.
* Brainstorm possible scenes, or how to make them happen (without changing the course of the
story, of course).
* Go back again, see what’s changed over time.
Where
* Interview the place just as you interview the people. Prep for it.
* Get transition/punctuation sounds, not just general ambi.
* Point your mic to where the action is.
Why
* Keep your end goal in sight: what do you need/want/desire out of this interview? Pare it down
so you can remember.
* Don’t just stick to your prepared questions – go where the conversation goes.
* Know when to interrupt/challenge/direct, but also know when to keep your mouth shut and
ears open.
If you don’t have it on tape, you don’t have it.
ALWAYS BE RECORDING!
