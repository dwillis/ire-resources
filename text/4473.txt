Why do I cast no shadow?

Why do I cast no shadow?
Are there lights on all sides shining on me?
Ahead, ahead,
curled up inside the serpent's coils,
the damp breath of death on my face.
I knew at that instant, something must change
or I'd die.
Algo tenía que cambiar.
— Gloria Anzaldúa

Why do I cast no shadow? ­ Silk

"Why do I cast no shadow? Reaction and non-reaction to the police shootings of Latinos in the
U.S." is a multi-part exploration of national and local community reaction to some of the lethal
police shootings of Latinos that have taken place in 2015, along with a look at the numbers
nationally and a glimpse of Latino-police relations in Philadelphia.

The dead who make no noise

Jessie Hernandez. Rúben García Villalpando. Antonio Zambrano Montes. Ernesto Javier Canepa
Díaz. Hector Morejón. Nearly every month of the year so far in 2015 has seen a police shooting of
an unarmed Latino or Latina. They are the dead who make no noise.

Numbers without authority

Aggregate statistics about use of lethal force by police oﬃcers are hard to come by, and oddly
inconsistent. Because of the discrepancies, they end up being numbers without authority.

Factoring in the Border Patrol

According to some watchdog organizations, in the past ﬁve years, nearly 40 people have died at
the hands of the Border Patrol — the largest law enforcement agency in the nation, with 60,000
armed customs oﬃcers and Border Patrol agents, and a transparency and accountability
problem. Are we factoring in the Border Patrol when we talk about use-of-force and Latinos?

What about Philadelphia?

One of the revelations of the Department of Justice's report on an investigation of the
Philadelphia Police Department is that oﬃcer-involved shootings, including fatal ones, are on the
rise. And that the department has had nearly 400 deadly force incidents between 2007 and 2013.
But numbers don't tell the whole story about policing community in any city. So we ask, what
about Philadelphia?
