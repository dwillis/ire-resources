Temperature Anomaly vs. Sea Level Rise Commitment
Commitment levels are achieved when the ocean equilibrates
to the combined effects of an expanding warming ocean,
melting of land ice primarily at the poles, and other smaller
drivers.
Levermann et al. in 2013 calculated that the commitment level
relationship is:

1o C = 2.3 meters (7.5 feet) of committed SLR


1o C (1.8o F) = 2.3m (7 ft.)



2o C (3.6o F) = 4.6m (14 ft.)



3o C (5.4o F) = 6.9m (21 ft.)



4o C (7.2o F) = 9.2m (28 ft.)

Southern Florida
with 1 foot of Sea
Level Rise
This is the approximate
commitment level for a
temperature rise of 0.1
degrees C which occurred
in the late 1970s.
This level will be realized
between 2018 and 2024: the
exact timing is uncertain
because warming
(expanding) the ocean and
melting of polar ice to
equilibration are slow nonlinear processes.

Two Levels of Response:
1. Mitigation - direct intervention such as
reducing carbon emissions; long-time frame
2. Adaptation - modifying infrastructure or
behavior to adjust to rising temperatures and
sea level, increased coastal flooding and
perturbation of weather patterns; Immediate
and short-time frame

Develop new interdisciplinary solutions through
partnerships and collaboration
The SLSC is a university-wide center for:
1) conducting, facilitating, and
synthesizing research and education
to advance understanding of sealevel rise and its impacts on the wellbeing of both human and natural
systems, and
2) converting this knowledge into
actions for the benefit of society
