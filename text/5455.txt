All of these agencies will not release the names of
immigrants facing deportation. You can get access to a
case if you can get the immigrant to sign a privacy
waiver form.

ICE Privacy waiver form

You can get access to a case file against an
immigrant from ICE if you can get the
immigrant to sign a privacy waiver form.
It’s pretty easy but it takes a really long time
to get the file. One time it took me over one
year.

EOIR privacy waiver
Requests for information about a person other than the
requester require proper authorization allowing release of
the information...the FOIA Service Center recommends that
you include in your request an authorization to release
information from the person who is the subject of the
request, or an explanation about how the public interest
outweighs the privacy interest of the subject of the record.
The FOIA Service Center recommends having the person
who is the subject of the request complete and sign Form
DOJ-361 (Certification of Identity) for this purpose. If you
are the attorney of record, you may wish to provide
evidence of that fact, such as a valid entry of appearance,
Form EOIR-27 or Form EOIR-28.

Data and documents from other agencies

The U.S. Department of Labor has really good data for temporary workers. DOL has a foreign labor certification office
that has a lot of data and contracts for H2A, H2b and other temporary workers. There’s also disclosure data for
recruiters abroad.
○
DOL also has an enforcement database for minimum wage and overtime violations (there’s a section for migrant
workers)
DHS – Inspector General
State Department
○
Merida spending, embassy correspondence, treaty reports
Office of National Drug Control Policy
○
What to ask for: drug seizure data, strategy development notes, budget details
Treasury Department
○
seized assets, repatriated cash, money laundering investigations

Recruiter disclosure data

Approved H2A contracts including employer info and number of workers

Wage and Hour Compliance Action Data

Not everyone facing deportation entered the country
illegally.
Elizabeth Keathley moved to Illinois from her native Philippines in 2003 to live with her husband. When she tried to
get a driver’s license. She didn’t realized she registered to vote after she agreed to be an organ donor. As a legal
resident, she can’t vote. That mistake almost got her deported.
National Voter Registration Act, known as the motor voter law, people can register to vote when they apply for a
driver’s license or ID card, and state employees can’t ask for proof of citizenship. The law was designed to boost voter
participation by making it easier for people to register to vote has had an unintended consequence for some legal
residents.

Veteran facing deportation
Miguel Perez Jr. fought in Afghanistan following the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
When he returned he struggled with PTSD. The VA hospital didn’t help him
and he ended up becoming addicted to alcohol and cocaine. He got arrested
with a friend who sold drugs and plead guilty to a felony charge. He served
seven years in state prison and before he was released for good behavior he
was transferred to a detention center.

The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied his request to stop his
deportation order. This was Perez’s last option. Senator Tammy Duckworth
(D-IL) introduced a private bill to help Perez stay in the country.

Detention Centers

Audits
Contracts with vendors
Injury and death reports of detainees
There’s been an increase in the number of suicides. You can request reports (
both from the county and ICE)

The FOIA library has a lot of reports and contracts. Take a look there before filing a
request.

Be creative with your FOIA work
●
●

There’s a long backlog with federal FOIAs.
I suggest filing FOIAs to local agencies too
○

Ex. I was able to get detailed data from McHenry Detention Center. That same data would have
taken over a year if I had filed it ICE.

I was able to documents from federal court on a case involving a u-visa case

Wendy Palacios agreed to testify against the predatory smuggler who brought her
into the country illegally in 2014 then tried to rape her. In exchange, she’d get a
pathway to citizenship —a so-called U-visa for crime victims who cooperate in
criminal investigations. But U.S. Border Patrol refused to sign the form she needed
for the visa.

Case law: NY Times Co (Boston Globe) v. U.S. DHS
In 2011, the Boston Globe filed a FOIA requesting the names, crimes, and
last-known states of residence of convicted criminals released in the United States
by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, and the reasons they were
not deported.
The paper fought the denials and two years later the court ordered the agency to
release the data. The court said “must weigh that privacy interest against the
public interest in disclosure. There is "only one relevant public interest, that of
`open[ing] agency action to the light of public scrutiny.'”
** You can use this argument in FOIAs where you request names and some
documents.
