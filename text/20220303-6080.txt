Why (and how)
you should
include public
lands, tourism
and Indigenous
issues in your
climate change
coverage
K. Sophie Will
Senior National Parks Reporter, Editor
The Spectrum/USA Today/Report for America

Land recognition
We are on the ancestral land of the
Mvskoke (Muscogee) people and the
ᏣᎳᎫᏪᏘᏱ Tsalaguwetiyi (Cherokee, East)
people.

NAJA

I am not indigenous
and am deﬁnitely
missing perspectives.
The point of this is to
get you to thinking
about how to include
indigenous
perspectives and
issues in your
reporting and ask the
experts.

CLIMATE CHANGE FOR EVERYONE
●
●
●

●
●
●
●

Climate change is one of the most important
topics we cover -- it permeates everything
Human-land relationship mindset
How are you covering climate change
already?
○ Focusing on land, add humans, vice
versa
For BOTH urban and rural reporters
Ask where! Place is so important
Water is life.
People don’t “believe” in climate change, they
just don’t understand it.

Relationships

Understand,
not believe

Humans and land are
not mutually
exclusive

People don’t
understand climate
change, not believe

Sense of
place

Story
ideas

Always ask the
question “where?”

TAKE
AWAYS

Hoping to give you
several
ideas/datasets!

land?

Solutions

make a decision
