Making a UIPA Request
Minimum

Consider

• In writing (e-mail counts)

• Delivery method that tracks receipt

• Your contact information

• Identify format of record requested if not
paper copy

• Reasonable description of record
• Method of transmittal for copy (e.g., inspect
only, mail, fax, e-mail, pick up)
Minimum constitutes a formal request that
starts the clock for any deadlines
OIP has Request to Access a Government Record
Form (http://oip.hawaii.gov/forms/)

search, review, and redaction fees by

UIPA Public Interest Discount
• Submit a statement of facts with the UIPA request
• The Agency must make the following determinations
• The requested record pertains to the operation or activities of the agency
• The record is not readily available in the public domain
• You have the primary intention and actual ability to widely disseminate information from the
government record to the general public at large
• Non-conclusory factual statements concerning those criteria will make it more difficult for the
agency to deny a public interest discount
• For some agencies, simply stating that you part of the news media may be sufficient
• But be prepared to provide more details
• Discount is only $60 total and does not apply to duplication costs

Parsing Notice to Requester
Costs
Search, Review, and Segregation

Copying

• Are estimated hours proportionate to the
scope of your request?

• If more than 5¢ per page, ask for citation to
regulatory authority and/or breakdown of
how the agency calculated the charge.

• If requested, did you receive the public interest
discount?
• Make sure agency NOT charging labor for
making copies
• After documents produced, ask for itemization
of charges, including breakdown of who
searched, reviewed, and redacted documents

– If breakdown not forthcoming, ask for copier
lease contract, agency’s last invoice for purchase
of paper, etc.
– If requesting electronic format, dig further

• Ask how the estimate of pages calculated.
• If copy charges unreasonable, ask to inspect
(not copy) documents
– Inspection will not reduce search, review, and
redaction fees
– Use camera or portable scanner to make copies

Your Responsibilities
• Payment of fees
– Prepayment may be required if disclosed in Notice
to Requester
• 50% of estimated search, review and redaction
fees for current request
• 100% of other lawful charges (e.g., duplication,
postage, materials cost)
• 100% of unpaid fees for prior requests

• Arrange with agency, as appropriate, to inspect
and copy records

Considered Abandonment
Agency may ignore request if you fail to take
appropriate action within 20 business days of a
Notice to Requester or from the date that
records are made available
Bottom Line: Don’t wait too long if an agency
responds to your request

• Clarify request if agency seeks clarification

Be Polite and Understanding: Civil Servants are Bureaucrats, not Evil Henchmen
