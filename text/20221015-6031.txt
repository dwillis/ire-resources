Backgrounding candidates - 10 things
1. Check news archives. This seems to go without saying, but having seen people fail to
look at clips from the past and miss a giant red flag, well…
2. Check voting history records to see if folks have voted in the past, how long they’ve been
registered, how long they’ve been in that party. 2020 is the first year ​Lauren Boebert
voted in a primary. In January, she could join Congress. (Her mother switched from D to
R in the spring, also her first primary.)
3. Check all the court records - municipal court records where they live as well as state and
federal courts. Again, see ​Lauren​.
4. All the social (​this guy​ is a school board member in Lamar, Colo., he is up and meming
early everyday it seems) including YouTube (​Lauren deleted hers​) for the candidate,
spouses and parents (her husband’s ​MySpace page​ still exists, and don’t discount
Pinterest​, i guess).
5. Consider using Facebook’s Crowdtangle to track Insta, Reddit & FB mentions of contest
& candidate.
6. Workbench​ allows you to scrape ​twitter feeds​ with ease, then you can ​analyze them​.
Don’t forget ​Politwoops from ProPublica​ for the deleted tweets.
7. Personal financial disclosure. Candidates must file one in most states disclosing sources
of income, assets and debts, thought they may be pretty vague. They’re online for ​U.S.
House of Representatives​ and ​U.S. Senate​ candidates.
8. Campaign finance. Don’t just check who the campaign is getting money from. Who is the
campaign paying? And has the candidate given at the state or federal level this cycle or
in the past? Are they self-funding? Might be good to compare success records on this.
9. Professional licenses. Do they say they have one? Look it up. See if there are
complaints.
10. Property. Where do they live? Look it up on the assessor’s office. Do they own a
business building? May not make it in a story, but useful info.
