The Victoria (Texas) Advocate is a family-owned newspaper with a daily circulation of
about 20,000.
In the annual Texas APME contest, we’re one of the smallest newspapers competing in
the second-biggest circulation category in the state. In the most recent contest, the
Advocate placed first, second and third in investigative reporting.
How did we do it? I know IRE likes tip sheets, so here’s a list I came up with:
1) Have a hurricane hit your home.​ I don’t seriously recommend this, of course,
but two of our investigations centered on Harvey’s aftermath -- how the storm
intensified the already-existing gap between the rich and poor
(​https://www.victoriaadvocate.com/projects/special_reports/hidden_in_plain_sight
/​); and how a landlord claiming to be a nonprofit evicted people after the storm.

ter-harvey/article_013ea6eb-0d45-5b88-aee5-695195afbf32.html​)
2) Have a special taxing district hire disgraced former Congressman Blake
Farenthold​ as its first full-time paid lobbyist in violation of the Texas Open
Meetings Act.

3) Hire smart, dedicated reporters​ -- namely Marina Riker and Jessica Priest -- to
cover the two stories above.
4) Partner with Report for America​ to hire another smart, dedicated reporter -Ciara McCarthy -- to provide sufficient bandwidth for Marina and Jessica to do
their investigations. (​https://www.reportforamerica.org/corps-members-2018/​)
During the first year of Report for America, the nonprofit and the community paid
for three-fourths of Ciara’s salary. During the second year, the community
increased its donations, so about half of Ciara’s salary for the coming year is
covered again.
5) Have your newspaper owned by a family​ committed to serving its community. I
realize this is largely out of your control, but I would be remiss to not add this
plug for such local ownership. (​https://www.victoriaadvocate.com/site/about.html​)
6) Figure out how to pay your best reporte​r a little more. This is how we keep
Jessica Priest a few years ago with a larger newspaper came calling.
7) Figure out how to retool ​after a larger newspaper raids you. This is what we’re
doing now after the San Antonio Express-News hired two of our reporters -Marina and Laura Garcia -- who worked on our “Understanding Harvey” series
that won a national SPJ award for public service.

8) Apply for Total Newsroom Training​ from IRE, which we were lucky enough to
receive several years ago. That gift has kept giving because it’s allowed us to
also send several staffers to CAR training in Missouri since then. Our managing
editor recently attended the weeklong workshop, and our city editor and Ciara
are going later this summer. (​https://www.ire.org/events-and-training/tnt​)
9) Always look for free training.​ One suggestion: Get your education reporter
active in the Education Writers Association, which offers many scholarships to
attend training. In the past couple of years, we also have sent staffers to free
training offered by the Solutions Journalism Network, the Maynard Institute, the
Center for Health Journalism, SPJ, IRE, SNPA, the Ravitch Fiscal Reporting
Program, and through Report for America. And we don’t have a training budget,
except to pay for the webinars we arrange for the newsroom.
10) ​Make friends with top journalists.​ Earlier this week, we imposed on my friend
from my Nieman year, investigative reporter Brent Walth, to lead a session on
watchdog reporting. Brent spent the afternoon with reporters and editors for free.
We bought the pizza. (​https://journalism.uoregon.edu/people/directory/bwalth​)
