THE NEW SOFT MONEY
Citizens United, 527s, 501(c)s and the Rise of
Super PACs

PRIOR TO CITIZENS UNITED…
 Outside groups

certainly spent money
 Some had as much
impact as Super PACs
Swift Boat Vets
 Moveon.org – Bush not
on our side
 PVF: Ashley’s Story
 NSP: Willie Horton


 First three done

through “527
committees”

AFTER CITIZENS UNITED….
 Restrictions lifted on

express advocacy
 Groups that can spend
unlimited funds…
Super PACs (new!)
 Labor Unions (new!)
 Corporations (new!)
 501(c)4s (new!)
 501(c)6s (new!)


WHO DISCLOSES WHAT
 Super PACs:


Disclose all donors
Sometimes, though,
donors are C4s
 C4s don’t disclose their
donors




Disclose expenditures
Ad buys (TV, radio,
online)
 Phone banks, GOTV


List candidate, state
 Who they support or
oppose


 C4s, C6s, labor unions

Don’t disclose donors
 Disclose expenditures


Ad buys
 Phone banks, GOTV


Candidate supported
or opposed UNLESS
 Run issue ads


Disclosed only within
30 days of a primary or
60 days of general
 Lists candidate
mentioned


THE OLD RULES ABOUT “ISSUE ADS”
STILL APPLY…
 Under Citizens United

Anyone can run express
advocacy
 “Vote for, vote against”


 Despite that, we see

most C4s and C6s
Run issue ads
 Mention federal
candidates
 “Tell Joe Smith you
don’t want higher
taxes”


There might be some donor disclosure…
 Van Hollen v. FEC
 Sued to require

c4s, c6s to disclose
 Applies only to
electioneering
 FEC says they will
apply ruling
retroactively
 Nonprofits turning
to express
advocacy

A NOTE ON ELECTIONEERING…
 There is a ton of

spending that does
NOT show up in FEC
files
 The only way to track
it is to go to the public
files the FCC requires
broadcasters to
maintain
 Sunlight is part of a
coalition of groups
trying to get these
forms online

HERE’S WHAT ONE LOOKS LIKE (THERE
IS NO STANDARD FORMAT FOR THESE)

LET’S TAKE A LOOK AT CHAMBER
OF COMMERCE…
 Committee type

“E”
 Means it only
does issue ads
 Note that all
filings are
electioneering
communications

FEC HAS A COMPLETE LIST OF
THESE COMMITTEE CODES

LET’S LOOK AT A SUPER PAC
 Committee type “O”
 Means it’s a super

PAC
 We have an address
(Sacramento? For
Hoosiers?)
 We have a treasurer’s
name
 Forms filed include
statement of
organization, quarterly
report, etc.

LET’S LOOK AT THE STATEMENT OF
ORGANIZATION
 Page one:

Boiler plate
letter saying
they’re a super
PAC
 All super
PACs file this

MOVING ON TO PAGE TWO…
 Address of

committee
 Email &
website (if there
is one—often
there is)
 Treasurer’s
name

MOVING ON TO PAGE THREE…
 Tells you what

kind of
committee it is
 Tells you if it
supports one or
multiple
candidates

MOVING ON TO PAGE FOUR
 Gives you the

phone number of
the treasurer
 With a lot of these
shadowy groups,
that’s going to be
your first point of
contact
 Sometimes they
list two or three
individuals

AND HERE’S A 24-48 HOUR NOTICE
 Candidate name
 Amount spent
 Race, and whether

they supported or
opposed named
candidate
 Also can see who
made the ad buy

ALL ACCESSIBLE THROUGH THE
FOLLOW THE UNLIMITED MONEY
TRACKER

Also has a page for ―organizational donors‖
(includes companies, nonprofits, unions, etc.)

For the most part, it’s rich people giving
to super PACs
 Sheldon Adelson
 Harold Simmons
 Bob Perry
 Jeffrey Katzenberg
 Jerry Perenchio
 Peter Thiel
 Foster Friess
 Even most

corporate donors
are companies
controlled by these
individuals

BUSINESSES CONTINUE TO OPERATE
THROUGH 501C4 AND C6 ORGANIZATIONS

SO WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT THE
501CS?

 Here’s a recent electioneering communication
 Run by a group called Freedom Path
 Let’s dig deeper

WE TELL YOU THEY’RE NOT A
SUPER PAC
 When it’s a super

PAC, we tell you
 When it’s not, we
leave that space
blank
 So what kind of
group is Freedom
Path?

FIRST CLUE
 Go to the FEC

filings
 It’s a type “E”
committee
 Like Chamber of
Commerce
 It’s a group (other
than PACs) making
electioneering
communications

LET’S LOOK AT A FILING
 We get an address
 The custodian of

records (who looks
like she does FEC
compliance for a
living)…
 You also get the
date the ad ran,

ON PAGE TWO…
 Lists of

people
sharing
control
 Plus their
addresses
 And
employer/oc
cupation

NOTE THAT WE CAN LOOK THESE
PEOPLE UP IN OPENSECRETS.ORG
 Using main

search on
home page
 Bensing a
revolver
 Bensing a
lobbyist
 Bensing
working for
four PACs

WE CAN SEE HE USED TO WORK
FOR JOHN ENSIGN…
 Now works for

SBC Strategic
Consulting
 Used to work
for November
Inc., another
lobbying firm

INTERESTS HE REPRESENTS
 Oooh, Ultimate

Fighting
Championship!
 State of Nevada
 Other
companies…

…AND THE PACS HE SERVES AS
TREASURUER
 All four are

Super PACs
 Freedom Path
Action Network
sounds a lot like
Freedom Path
 Check to see if
there are super
PACs with
names similar to
the group you’re
looking at

BACK TO THE FEC DISCLOSURE
 Money spent
 What they’re buying
 Federal candidates

mentioned
 Yellow: Who’s being
paid


Note that with ad
buys, most of the
money will go to TV,
radio, etc.

GOOGLING FREEDOM PATH…
 In this case, we’re

lucky
 They have a page
telling us they’re a c4
 So we know what it is
and who’s behind it
 What we don’t know
is who contributes
 Always worth
pointing which
groups don’t disclose
donors

IRS SOI HAS A LIST OF ALL TAX
EXEMPT ORGS…
