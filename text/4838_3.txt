Behind the bonanza: How
County’s $1B gold
urine tests make millions

As treatment programs mushroom, so do reports of
kickbacks, patient brokering and insurance fraud.
By Christine Stapleton
and Pat Beall
Palm Beach Post Staff Writers

It took Frank Cid just six
years to create a lucrative,
one-stop addiction recovery
empire big enough to bring
Wall Street to town.
And Wall Street brought
cash. Last September, an affiliate of Goldman Sachs was preparing to shell out $32.5 million for the real estate investor’s portfolio of high-end
treatment programs: detox,
rehab, outpatient sober living
rentals and a lab to test his clients’ urine.
But accusations of an FBI
investigation killed his deal,
said Cid in a lawsuit alleging
defamation.
Under the radar, local fortunes are being made here,
and quickly, from getting
addicts and alcoholics clean
and sober.
With the big money has

threatening to upend an estimated $1 billion industry, the
fourth largest in Palm Beach

Reports of kickbacks,
patient brokering, inflated

the same time, the number of

Like thousands of other families, when an out-of-state couple last year sent their 23-yearold son to Palm Beach County
for addiction treatment, they
understood his recovery could
be lengthy and pricey.
What they didn’t anticipate
was the bill that arrived weeks
after he finished treatment:
a six-figure tab, not for counseling or medical care, but for
the humblest of drug screens —
peeing into a cup.
The total charge for nine
months of tests: $304,318.
Behind the glitzy ads for
pain-free drug detox and luxury beachfront rehabs, urine drug
screens are generating millions
for Palm Beach County’s addiction treatment industry.
In the process, the sky-high
charges have exploited addicts
and alcoholics seeking help,
gouged insurers and spurred
law enforcement interest in the
area’s billion-dollar addiction
treatment industry.
Not every sober house, lab or

POST INVESTIGATION: ADDICTION TREATMENT UNDER SCRUTINY
Sober
continued from A1

sober homes, which don’t
have to be licensed, are
mushrooming. So are labs
making millions of dollars
from the drug testing of
addicts.
Alarmed, the FBI and
the state last year created
a task force to investigate.
Even local operators
say privately that it may
take a very big, very public crackdown to curb
abuses.
Former federal prosecutor Jennifer Bolen, who
advises treatment businesses, doctors and pharmaceutical companies on
drug testing regulation,
agrees. “Nothing will stop
unless there is a ferocious
enforcement effort,” she
said.

A Bentley

Considered the largest
in the U.S. and one of the
best-known in the world,
the county’s addiction
treatment industry isn’t
mentioned on the county website. At $1 billion,
though, it’s a major economic engine, ranking
below only tourism, agriculture and construction.
International clients
arrive at PBIA on private jets. For those who
can pay — and those with
good insurance — beachside facilities offer spalike luxury. Amenities
can include golf therapy
and rap music education.
Some promise near-painless detoxification from
even the worst opiate
addictions.
A single addict can generate hundreds of thousands of dollars for companies, and not just for
treatment: Interventions,
lab tests and even vitamins are among the array
of related businesses.
A $30,000 bill for a
28-day residential stay is
not unusual. Although
major insurance companies may foot the bill,
some desperate men and
women, or their families,
will ante up cash, or take
out loans from special-

Many are fed up. Some are
providing the FBI and state
investigators with information about suspect practices.
“It all seemed to be
working well until pee
came along and ignited these bad instincts in
a bunch of people,” said
David Hirshfeld, an attorney specializing in health
care law. “Pee comes
along, and everybody
wants in.”

Cash machine

For the longest time,
running a sober home was
a dicey financial proposition. People didn’t do it for
the money because there
was no money to be made
from providing supportive housing to newly sober
addicts and alcoholics.
Owners scraped by. It
was, said one person close
to the industry, “God’s
work.”
That began changing
when some realized insurance companies would pay
big bucks for urine testing. At first, money from
urine testing was just a
means to make ends meet.
But as time went on, and
the cash started rolling
in, it became a financial
linchpin — and now, a gold
mine.
Urine testing is a staple
of rehab, a fast way to both
track relapse and gauge
use of prescribed drugs.
It’s also cheap. Corner
drug stores sell $25 tests
that will immediately indicate the presence of a wide
array of drugs.
Over the past few years,
though, some treatment
centers, sober homes and
their affiliated labs have
charged hundreds of dollars for a similar test. One
routinely charged a reported $1,500.
Then, the same urine
sample could be shipped
off to another lab for more
sophisticated, and far

ty lenders. And that’s just
the first step in what can
be a months-long course
of treatment.
Profit-taking isn’t hard
to spot: One attorney said
that when he can’t find a
client’s office he looks for
a Bentley in the driveway.

ness from business owners since the FBI raided
the two halfway houses.

A new hustle

More money to come

Confidence that the
county’s industry will
continue to grow is so
high that investment firms
and private investment
pools across the country
want in.
“There is a wash of
money from private equity
funds looking to invest,”
said Drew Rothermel,
CEO of Origins Behavioral
Healthcare, which recently purchased West Palm
Beach’s Hanley Center, a
30-year fixture of the treatment community. “And
there’s more to come.”
Why?
Because of Obamacare
and mental health parity laws, more addicts
have insurance and that
insurance must cover substance abuse treatment
for as many stints in rehab
as it takes to get clean.
Since most addicts and
alcoholics relapse, several stays in rehab are not
uncommon.
Addicts, especially those with insurance,
have become a sought-after commodity. One newly formed company, treatmentcalls.com, operates
a call center and allows
treatment centers to bid
on callers seeking treatment based on their
insurance coverage —
HMO, PPO or cash. Some
centers bid as much as
$1,000 for a call screened
by the service.
When inpatient treatment ends after 30 to 60
or 90 days and the client moves out, insurance continues to pay for
intensive outpatient treatment and partial-hospitalization programs,
including regular drug
testing and therapy. But
they don’t pay for room
and board.
With no job, little money and no place to live,
newly clean addicts —

more expensive, testing.
Just one test, for one
person, at one facility
could yield up to $5,000.
And some sober homes
test every resident, seven
days a week.
“There’s never a reason
to test every day,” said Dr.
Stuart Gitlow, past president of the American Society of Addiction Medicine
and an internationally recognized expert on addiction.
For one thing, many
drugs, including opiates
and marijuana, remain in
a person’s system for days,
or even weeks. Back-toback tests simply repeat
what is already known.
In fact, said Gitlow,
some addiction specialists
never test at all.
Further, he said, some
testing practices are “just
a stupid use” of screening. He offers the example
of someone who goes into
rehab because he wants
to stop smoking pot. The
rehab facility might test
him for marijuana, but then
also tests for drugs the client has never used, or even
expressed interest in using.
“Now they are testing
him every other day for 20
other drugs, just to do the
billing and get the profits.”

Mushrooming labs

Palm Beach County treatment centers and sober
homes have rushed to open
their own drug testing labs.
Today, 31 local labs are
either indirectly or directly
tied to the owner of a sober
house or treatment center.
All opened since 2011 and
almost half opened in the
past year alone.
This dual business ownership of both a sober
home with clients who
need to be tested and a lab
providing tests can guarantee revenue; an arrangement leading some sober
homes to charge minimal
rent — or no rent at all.
As long as residents
keep urinating into a paper
cup, owners don’t need a
rent check. An addict test-

especially those with
insurance — have become
targets of unscrupulous
business owners or used
as pawns in a variety of
local scams.
Among suspect practices:
■ Sober home operators offering free rent,
cellphones, gym memberships and grocery gift
cards, along with waiving insurance co-pays
and deductibles to entice
recovering addicts to
come to their facilities.
■ Halfway house owners paying a bounty, often
$500, to “junkie hunters” for every new addict
they can deliver to the
halfway house. Separately, if an addict in the
halfway house relapses,
detox businesses may pay
bonuses to managers of
the houses if they refer the
addict to the detox facility.
■ Treatment businesses
offering to pay an addict’s
halfway house rent if the
halfway house refers the
addict to their outpatient
program.
■ Businesses filing
false insurance claims for
unnecessary treatment
and tests, and physicians
certifying that treatments
and tests are medically
necessary without properly examining recovered
addicts.

ed three times a week with
the more sophisticated urinalysis is a veritable cash
machine: $36,000 every
month, $432,000 a year.
A sober home with six
residents on the same testing regimen could bring in
$2.5 million.
Despite the jaw-dropping bills, when doctors sign off on such tests
as medically necessary,
insurance companies pay
up. So does Medicare. So
does Medicaid.
There’s evidence major
insurers are hitting the
brakes. In New Jersey,
for instance, Blue Cross
Blue Shield made industry headlines in 2013,
when it sued a Florida lab
over what it alleged were
unnecessary drug tests.
San Diego-based Millennium Health, which until
recently ran tests for an
area methadone clinic,
is now facing multimillion-dollar penalties from
the federal government’s
Center for Medicare and
Medicaid Services related
to testing.
Locally, Hirshfeld said
some of his clients have
received letters from insurers looking for their money back.
This month, Cigna sued
Sky Toxicology and two
affiliated lab firms in federal court here, alleging
a $20 million civil fraud

Some of the practices are being scrutinized
by law enforcement for
possible violations of
Florida’s patient brokering law, which bans paying for patient referrals
— even if the payment is
in goods, not cash. But
it’s unlikely a federal and
state task force would be
looking at just one law.
Last September, FBI
agents raided the 84-unit
West Palm Beach Green
Terrace condos used by
Good Decisions Sober
Living as a halfway house
and office, seizing boxes
of files. Two months later, agents carted off boxes from the offices and
halfway house of Real
Life Recovery in Delray
Beach.

Urine testing uproar

By far the most lucrative and controversial
practice in the recovery process is urine testing. Industry experts say
the tests are an essential
part of getting clean and
sober. They not only show
whether clients are staying clean, they also measure whether legitimately prescribed medications
are taken in the proper
dosage.
But in the past few
years, what kind of test
should be done, how

revolving around urine
testing.
According to the suit,
Sky, a consortium of labs,
offered doctors and drug
treatment centers ownership interests in the companies. For their investment, said Cigna, providers were paid “kickbacks
in the form of dividends”
linked to how many urine
tests they sent to Sky.
The suit does not specify
how much money Sky paid
to the doctors and centers. However, two sources
close to the industry told
The Post that $12,500 was
one investment amount,
and that for the $12,500,
providers sending urine
to Sky could get anywhere
from $24,000 quarterly to
$50,000 monthly.
Sky is a Texas-based
company. It does business
in multiple states. But the
suit was filed in West Palm
Beach, said Cigna in court
papers, because the bulk
of the alleged misdeeds
took place in South Florida — and the doctors and
treatment centers who
participated are here, too.
Despite the shakeups,
Florida remains a sought-after source of potential lab
test revenue. Although a
financial penalty has yet to
be determined, Millennium
reports it has settled “all federal and state issues” with
Medicare and Medicaid.
The Florida lab sued by Blue
Cross Blue Shield in New Jersey was purchased by a Massachusetts firm, and the
case has since settled.
In Georgia, Khalid
Satary, a felon turned Palestinian philanthropist
whom the United States
has for years tried to
deport, also saw promise
in Florida markets.
Satary opened Nue Medical Consulting in 2013,
swiftly growing the drug
test lab equipment leasing and consulting firm
from four to 70 employees.
Among its first customers:
a West Palm Beach sober
home raided last year by
the FBI.

often and by whom has
caused an uproar. Insurance companies claim
addicts are being tested
too often and the types of
tests aren’t necessary.
A simple test that confirms whether an illegal drug is present is the
cheapest.
However, some samples are sent to labs for
additional tests, ones that
reveal which drug, and
how much of the drug, is
in the addict’s system. A
full battery of tests on one
sample of urine can cost
several thousand dollars —
and that’s just one test, on
just one client. Some sober
homes test three times a
week; some test daily.
Attorney David Hirshfeld, another specialist
in substance abuse treatment law, said many of
his clients have received
letters from insurers
demanding they return
money the companies
paid for unnecessary
tests.
Some of the wrongdoing is inadvertent, Hirshfeld said, committed by
mom-and-pop halfway
house owners who did
not know the law. Even
so, he said, ignorance is
not a defense.
Locals appear to be
spooked: Hirshfeld said he
has seen an uptick in busi-

Green Terrace

Good Decisions Sober
Living owner Ken Bailynson had no shortage of
prospective clients in late
2013, when Nue leased the
former New Jersey CPA an
array of lab equipment to
run urine tests.
Two years earlier, Bailynson had begun buying up units at Green Terrace condos in West Palm
Beach, a long-neglected complex off Belvedere
Road east of Interstate 95,
where condos sold for bargain basement prices. The
properties were then rented, primarily to newly
sober addicts.
Bailynson bought just
eight properties in 2011
and 2012, the year he
incorporated his lab. But
by last fall, Bailynson
owned 34 units, was the
condo association president and had set up his
business office in the condo clubhouse.
It’s not known how
many of Bailynson’s Good
Decisions Sober Living clients were steered to urine
testing at his lab, or how
much Bailynson charged
for those tests. Bailynson,
though, pulled in enough
cash from his various
operations to pay Nue’s
hefty equipment lease: an
$85,000 bill due roughly
every four weeks.
On Sept. 11, FBI agents
descended on Green Terrace. Armed with a search
warrant, agents left with
boxes of papers from Bailynson’s office.
Then, in December,
the FBI, U.S. Postal Service and state fraud investigators raided the Delray Beach headquarters
of businessman Eric Snyder’s two treatment companies: Real Life Recovery
of Delray Beach and Halfway There.
Halfway There is a sober
house. Real Life Recovery
of Delray Beach is a drug
testing lab, according to
state licensing records.
Neither Bailynson nor
Snyder has been charged

Otherwise bullish
investors are factoring
in the risk — or even the
appearance of risk. “The
lab abuses and the insurance abuses that are perceived to be happening in parts of the country makes some of these
funds cautious,” said
Rothermel.
Frank Cid’s deal with
Goldman Sachs fell apart
the day it was supposed
to close. According to a
defamation suit filed by
Cid, John Lehman, head
of the Florida Association
of Recovery Residences, told the investors Cid
was engaging in insurance
fraud and patient brokering — and that Cid is one
target of the FBI investigation.
No one, including Cid,
has been indicted. The
suit is pending.
In a small step toward
addressing unethical
practices in one aspect of
the industry, lawmakers
this year created a voluntary certification process
for Florida’s sober homes.
Standards cover accounting practices in addition
to living conditions.
No one, though, will be
required to become certified.
For now, legitimate
treatment facilities resent
the bad players for drawing the attention of
the FBI and giving the
already maligned industry another black eye. Just
as important, they say,
is the message that people exploiting addicts and
alcoholics are sending to
those seeking sobriety.
“We’re all natural hustlers,” said one halfway
house manager, a recovered alcoholic. But in
mining addicts and alcoholics for cash, he said,
“They are taking away the
drug and teaching them a
new hustle.”

with wrongdoing.
“We are fully cooperating with the government in terms of providing whatever they asked
for,” said Bruce Reinhart,
Bailynson’s attorney and
a former federal prosecutor. “Ultimately, I believe
they are going to conclude
nothing my client did was
illegal.”
Bailynson’s lab closed in
September. When it did,
a state Agency for Health
Care Administration investigation into complaints
that the lab was mismanaged by supervisors
closed, too. With the lab
shuttered, substantiating
the allegations wasn’t possible, said the investigator.
Problems were also
reported at Snyder’s Real
Life Recovery. AHCA investigators were told urine
wasn’t being stored or tested correctly.
But by the time the state
inspection began, the FBI
already had been at the
lab, confiscating records,
paperwork and manuals. Without records, the
state also closed that inquiry, too.
Although many in the
industry believe the state
and federal scrutiny is long
overdue, there’s also fear
of fallout as the joint task
force considers charges:
Even if drug-testing profits don’t dry up and leave
sober home owners without revenue, a crackdown
could leave hundreds on
the street.
It’s happened before.
A little less than three
weeks after the FBI raid on
Good Decisions, Bailynson’s lab was closed and
50-80 sober home tenants
were given their walking
papers: four days to pack
up and leave.

Florida’s top law enforcement officials knew by 2012
that Millennium Laboratories,
the nation’s largest drug testing company, was defrauding
Florida Medicaid of millions.
But that did not stop Attorney General Pam Bondi from
urging Medicare to pay for
high-priced and unnecessary
drug screening tests at the
heart of Millennium’s massive
scam, even as her own office
and federal prosecutors pursued civil charges against the
company.

POST INVESTIGATION: ADDICTION INDUSTRY

In 2013, Millennium Laboratories employees in San Diego work to process, via bar codes, thousands of urine samples that arrived from across the country. In October, Millennium, while
not acknowledging wrongdoing, agreed to pay $256 million to resolve federal kickback and civil fraud charges. DON BOOMER / SAN DIEGO UNION-TRIBUNE 2013

vices, though, Bondi argued
the tests were indeed needed.
The letter directly benefited
Millennium, a firm that once
salvaged a key anti-drug initiative championed by Bondi
and, through its high-powered
lobbying firm, had deep ties
to Bondi and Gov. Rick Scott’s
legal team.
In October, Millennium,
while not acknowledging
wrongdoing, agreed to pay
$256 million to resolve federal kickback and civil fraud
charges. The company has
been forced into Chapter 11
bankruptcy by its lenders,
even as founder James Slattery and other insiders walked
away with nearly $1 billion.
Florida’s Medicaid fraud
unit, an arm of the Attorney
General’s Office, is credited
with mounting an especially strong investigation into the
firm, working hand in glove
with federal prosecutors and
securing $8.9 million from Millennium to satisfy charges of
unlawful Florida Medicaid billings for drug tests.
The unit’s aggressive prosecution appeared at odds with
Bondi’s letter, which at times
echoed Millennium’s sales
pitches when arguing to keep
payments coming for a test
that boosted the company’s
profits.
Just restricting access to the
costly drug screens, she wrote,
would hamper efforts to curb
drug abuse. That, she wrote,
was a priority of the DO J,
which was working with Bondi’s office even then investigating Millennium.
“I write to urge you to take
swift action to halt the coordinated, nationwide efforts (of
Medicare contractors) to effectively end the use” of such
tests, she wrote. Medicare
should not restrict access to “a
critical diagnostic and treatment tool under the rationale
of ‘cost savings.’”
The tests Bondi defended were among the same tests
Millennium had been using to
bilk Florida’s Medicaid program, federal prosecutors
found.
But, Bondi wrote Friday, she
signed a letter drafted by staff
and intended to address her
longtime concern over babies
born to addicted mothers. It
was never intended to assist a
company under investigation,
she wrote.
Further, “At the time that
the letter was presented to me,
our investigation had not risen
to the level of my attention.”

HOW MILLENNIUM DID IT

Over a period of years, federal prosecutors charge, Millennium
Laboratories“was warned by consultants, customers, competitors,
insurers and regulators that its marketing schemes were illegal.”
Among the illicit practices:
■ Free urine testing cups. Millennium provided the cups, valued at
between $5 and $6 each, to doctors as long as they agreed to send
urine samples to Millennium for expensive tests. Doctors who failed
to provide enough urine samples had to pay back Millennium for
the cups, a cost that for one Florida clinic alone would have topped
$300,000. This was a kickback, DOJ said.
■ Custom Profiles. Contrary to the name,“Custom Profiles”
actually were predetermined lists of tests ordered regardless of a
patient’s needs. Doctors — or Millennium employees — filled out a
standing order for multiple drug screens on a patient. In this way, the
patient whose doctor wanted to know if he was taking prescribed
Xanax also would be tested automatically by Millennium for heroin,
cocaine, pot, Ecstasy, methadone, Angel Dust and a host of other
substances. Doctors who refused to order multiple tests regardless
of patient need frequently were dropped by Millennium.
■ Routine confirmatory tests. Sophisticated drug screens known
as confirmatory tests are generally called for only when a first,
inexpensive“pee-in-a-cup”drug screen has unexpected results:
drugs in the urine which were not prescribed, or the absence of drugs
in the patient’s urine when a patient is supposed to be taking them.
Millennium used rigged research results, false threats of legal liability
and gifts to persuade doctors to order confirmatory tests on every
patient, regardless of what the first test showed.
■ Genetic testing. Roughly $10 million of the DOJ penalty stems
from genetic testing routinely conducted on patients to determine
their likely response to pain medication.

Finally, said a spokesman,
Millennium did not get a break
from Bondi’s office: “We led a
49-state Medicaid fraud investigation into Millennium.”

Aggressive tactics

Bondi’s letter to the federal
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, came
as her office’s investigation of
Millennium was in its second
year. The DO J investigation
had been underway since at
least 2012.
CMS had its own concerns
about Millennium.
Medicare patients with no
history of drug abuse were
being tested by Millennium for
everything from heroin to pot
to Ecstasy. And it wasn’t just
Medicare patients.
A 2015 Palm Beach Post
investigation found that
drug-testing urine has in
recent years turned the
South Florida addiction treatment industry into a multibillion-dollar bonanza. Young
addicts with months of sobriety behind them and no indication of relapse were being
tested daily, sometimes for
$1,300 a pop. An FBI-led task
force has been investigating
for more than a year.
Millennium wasn’t the only
lab to profit from this explosion in testing, but the San
Diego firm is widely believed
to be the biggest: In seven
years, it eclipsed its rivals.
Its national reach naturally
put it in South Florida, where

Palm Beach County is an international destination for addiction treatment. And its aggressive sales tactics followed.
According to DO J, Millennium instructed salespeople to
tell doctors that if they did not
automatically test everyone,
the Drug Enforcement Administration might accuse them of
patient profiling or that Medicare might want its money
back. They distributed deceptive research results showing
that inexpensive tests were
inaccurate. They showered
clinic staff with gifts.
Internal company documents show that salespeople
were encouraged to tell doctors to test patients for nicotine because smoking cigarettes was an indication of
drug abuse; to test people on
Ritalin, a drug typically prescribed for school-age children, because it was linked to
cocaine use; and to test pregnant patients who had little
prenatal care because they
were more likely to abuse
drugs.
“I don’t care if they send it
to me in a Ziploc bag,” one Millennium executive wrote. “I
want their urine.”
Bondi jumped into the controversy after contractors
working for CMS expressed
concern about the mushrooming number of tests being used
to confirm results of a cheaper
“pee-in-a-cup” drug screens.
That inexpensive test typically reveals the presence or

absence of a drug.
Retesting the urine when
there’s no drug found in the
first test is known as a “negative confirmatory test.” A
more expensive test, it can
detect a broad array of substances. However, it is also not
intended to be routine.
For one thing, said attorney
Marc Vezina, who represented Brevard County doctors in
a whistleblower suit against
Millennium, if the first test
shows what you were looking for, “Why would you keep
looking? If you heard the hoof
beats you were expecting, why
would you keep looking for
zebras?”
But Millennium, which
declined comment, persuaded
doctors to order confirmatory
tests on the same urine sample for virtually all patients,
all of the time — even though
doing so without considering
the specific medical needs of a
Medicare or Medicaid patient
violates federal law.
These tests were a linchpin of both Millennium’s spectacular growth and, prosecutors said, its multimillion-dollar fraud.

The letter

In a four-page letter peppered with inaccurate medical data, and in language that
at times echoed Millennium’s
internal sales pitch memos,
the attorney general argued in
favor of confirmatory testing
when the cheaper test showed
no evidence of drugs.
“It is widely understood in
the medical community” that
the inexpensive pee-in-a-cup
tests often were inaccurate,
Bondi wrote.
Millennium had made the
same argument. In fact, while
the cheaper tests can return
inaccurate results, they are
regarded in the medical field
as reliable. Millennium rigged
research data to suggest otherwise, then instructed its salespeople to spread the fiction,
court filings and company documents show.
Bondi also wrote that the
confirmatory tests were needed because it was easy to cheat
on the cheaper test: “Indeed, a
simple Google search of ‘how
to beat a drug test’ will yield
tens of millions of hits in less
than a second.”
Millennium salespeople
had been told to tell doctors:
“There are 100 ways to pass
a (cheaper) drug test. Google
how to ... and you will see!”
“There are people gaming
the system, no doubt about
it,” said Dr. Stuart Gitlow, past
president of the American
Society of Addiction Medicine

and founder of a physician
training program in addictive disease. But, he said, Bondi and Millennium miss the
point: “We don’t need to do
$1,200, $1,500 tests every other day to detect them.”
Some addiction specialists
never test at all.
Millennium also pushed for
doctors to test for an older
class of legal antidepressants, a
practice that generated $55 million in billings. The antidepressants are rarely abused, but
Bondi told CMS that data existed showing expectant mothers
failed to report antidepressant
use 50 percent of the time, and
thus needed to be tested.
However, “We cannot find
any information that backs up
the 50 percent claim,” said
Kate Connors, spokeswoman
for the 58,000-member American Congress of Obstetricians
and Gynecologists.
Describing a growing incidence of NAS, a syndrome in
some newborns whose mothers are addicted to drugs,
Bondi also said that if a
cheaper urine test comes up
negative for opioid or antidepressants, “either because
of its unreliability or because
the mother purposefully beat
the drug test, the only way
the physician can protect
mother and baby is to confirm the results” of the cheaper test.
“Taking this critical diagnostic tool away from a woman’s OB-GYNs,” she wrote, “is
unconscionable.”
Connors, though, said that,
“We certainly would not agree
with the language used in the
letter to describe NAS, nor
does it appear to be medically
appropriate.”
But this, too, was a Millennium sales push. A Millennium marketing memo advised
that, “We’ve started to identify
a new niche market in OB/GYN
as physicians get more and
more concerned” about “an
alarming increase in the incidence of babies born with an
addiction to pain meds.”
“Let’s explore this avenue to
boost our new business.”
Bondi wrote that it was not
her intention to support dishonest practices by any company.
“The letter presented to
me only discussed the general
concept of drug testing,” she
wrote, and not, she believed,
the testing tightly linked to
Millennium’s Medicare billings.

Body bags, target practice
A look at how Millennium Laboratories viewed its opposition

By Pat Beall
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer

It was April 2012, Gov. Rick
Scott was signing off on a bill
designed to curb kickbacks
involving Florida drug testing
labs and no one seemed happier about it than Millennium
Laboratories.
Lamenting the industry’s
“rampant” unethical practices, the company’s president
said that certain labs “will
offer anything, say anything
and do anything” to entice
doctors to use their service.
Only months earlier,
though, Millennium’s top
executives had provided a
startling behind-the-scenes
glimpse at what their own
company was willing to do
and say, and what employees
might face if they showed disloyalty to “the family.”
Competitors had long been
skeptical of the firm’s rapid
success. Some of its own salespeople were downright worried, few more so than its Dallas regional sales manager,
Edward Zicari.

di’s letter, Brevard County’s
Omni Healthcare Inc. was seeing a broad array of unexpected tests, and unexpectedly
expensive bills, as its doctors
started using Millennium for
lab work.
“One of our poster children
was a 96- or a 97-year-old man
who was on Xanax for depression,” said Vezina, Omni’s
attorney.
The elderly man had memory loss. Doctors wanted to
make sure he was taking his
medication.
But instead of a test that
may have cost $15, said Vezina, Millennium was racking up
billings of $400 or $500 per
test.
That’s because, instead of
only testing for Xanax, they
were testing the elderly man
for street drugs: cocaine,
methamphetamine and PCP,
a horse tranquilizer linked to
biker gangs better known as
Angel Dust.
“I say if you can find a senior
citizen who is taking PCP, God
bless him,” Vezina said.
Omni ordered its doctors
to stop using the company.
It filed a whistleblower suit
alleging Millennium was
defrauding Medicare and
Florida Medicaid.
Vezina formally notified
Bondi’s office of what it found.
That was in early 2012, two
years before Bondi sent her
letter.
The same year,
ex-Millennium employees filed
several whistleblower suits,
alleging fraudulent practices.
A Massachusetts federal grand
jury took testimony on the
company.
Also in 2012, the state’s

Administration, which

Zicari believed Millennium’s
sales practices violated federal law, court documents show.
He said he had been asked to
bribe doctors to get information about Millennium competitors, that medically unnecessary tests were being used
to boost profits and insurers
were being billed twice for the
same tests.
Millennium fired, then sued
Zicari, saying he stole trade
secrets.
It wasn’t just Zicari voicing concerns. Customers, consultants and competitors all
were raising red flags about
the company’s money-making
schemes, the Department of
Justice charged.
But inside a San Diego hotel
conference room in 2012, Millennium outlined just how
hard it would fight anybody
who disrupted its business.
As Millennium founder James Slattery wound up
opening remarks before a
group of about 200 employees, security guards brought

wrote both Millennium and
Bondi’s office stating that
Millennium’s practice of
giving Florida doctors pricey
specimen cups for free —
as long as the doctors then
sent the urine to Millennium
for expensive testing — was
probably a kickback scheme.
But, according to federal
prosecutors, even after AHCA
put both the attorney general
and Millennium on notice, the
company continued to bilk
Medicare and Medicaid.

Influential friends

While this was occurring,
Millennium was establishing
influence, courting goodwill
and spreading cash in
Tallahassee.
It poured $67,500 into the
Republican Party of Florida,
which donated thousands
to Bondi’s campaign and
paid thousands more for her
consultants, polling, travel,
phones and staff.
The year AHCA notified
Bondi’s office of Millennium’s
fraud, the company beefed up
its lobbying roster with Heffley
& Associates, whose influential
principal, Richard Heffley, is a
leading Republican strategist.
It hired the powerhouse
law firm of GrayRobinson
to lobby on its behalf, and
GrayRobinson staffers directly
poured more than $10,000
into Bondi’s campaign
beginning in 2010, the year
Millennium hired the firm.
Bondi’s first chief of staff was a
GrayRobinson lawyer.
Pete Antonacci, a longtime
GrayRobinson shareholder
and lobbyist until Gov. Rick
Scott tapped him to be general
counsel in 2013, was the
governor’s top lawyer when
Bondi penned her letter.
Before that, Antonacci
served as the governor’s
appointee as Palm Beach

the podium.
Employees were invited to
approach the gold.
Millennium General Counsel Martin Price then began a
PowerPoint presentation.
Price boasted of Millennium’s aggressive legal strategy, said former sales representative Jodie Strain, including
litigation involving a former
employee identified as Tim.
“Mr. Price stated that Tim
had sued Millennium, and that
Millennium had forced him
into near bankruptcy; that
Tim would never be able to
repay his attorneys what he
owed and that Tim would never be able to find a job,” said
Strain, who testified before a
2012 Massachusetts grand jury
investigating Millennium.

Pete Antonacci,
governor’s top
lawyer at the
time, said he
was unaware
of Bondi’s
letter.

County state attorney. Now, he
heads the South Florida Water
Management District.
Antonacci said he
never lobbied on behalf
of Millennium while with
GrayRobinson, never
discussed Millennium with
Bondi, was unaware of Bondi’s
letter and did not know of
the state investigation into
Millennium.
As then-general counsel
to the governor, Antonacci
expressed some surprise
that he had not been told by
the attorney general’s office
that Florida was, according
to Bondi, leading a 49-state
investigation into Millennium
involving millions of dollars in
Florida Medicaid fraud.
When Antonacci stepped
down in 2014, Scott replaced
him with Timothy Cerio,
another GrayRobinson
attorney and Millennium’s
lobbyist since 2010. Cerio only
quit his post as a Millennium
lobbyist days after Scott
announced the appointment
in December 2014.
Through Scott’s press
office, Cerio declined
comment on whether he
had spoken to Bondi about
either the Millennium
investigation or her letter,
citing the fact that he was not
only a Millennium lobbyist
while at GrayRobinson, but
Millennium’s lawyer. As such,
said Scott spokeswoman Jackie
Schutz, Cerio is bound by
attorney-client privilege and
cannot discuss any Millennium
legal issues he may have talked

The Department of Justice
included Strain’s written statement in its civil fraud investigation of Millennium.
Price said Millennium
expected to drive one competitor into bankruptcy and
that the company had “hunted down” Ed Zicari’s ex-wife,
“hunted down” his girlfriend
and “hunted down” his new
employer.
Then came what Strain
called “the execution slides.”
Others who have seen the
slides confirm that the animated sequence first showed
a competing company’s name
on an indoor target. Bullets
tore into the target, accompanied by sounds of gunfire from
conference room speakers.
The next slide showed the
competitor’s name shot full of
holes.
It wasn’t just competing
companies in the line of fire.
“Mr. Price used actual photographs of the persons he was
about to methodically execute,” Strain said in the statement. The targets: Zicari and
ex-employee Tim Ammons.

to Bondi about.

A $312,000 gift

Millennium also played a
key role in keeping Florida’s
Prescription Drug Monitoring Program alive — a signature
issue for Bondi.
Florida in 2009 was reeling from a tsunami of the prescription opiate OxyContin.
Pill mills, clinics where prescriptions were handed out
like candy, attracted addicts
and dealers from throughout
the country, making Florida a
narco-tourism mecca.
With an average of eight
Floridians fatally overdosing
every day, lawmakers authorized what Bondi said was a
crucial tool for battling the
abuse: a statewide database
tracking prescriptions that
would let law enforcement
spot patients and doctors
engaged in dubious prescribing patterns.
But lawmakers balked at
paying for the database.
In 2010, as Bondi was campaigning for office and arguing in favor of financing the
database, Millennium and its
founder, Slattery, stepped up
to save it.
Millennium gave $312,000
to keep the database afloat.
Slattery was the first to chair
the fledgling nonprofit organization designed to oversee the
database, for which he won
effusive, public praise from
Florida’s Office of Drug Control. GrayRobinson provided
legal work.
As a result, the database survived until early 2011, when,
within weeks of being sworn
in, Bondi successfully led a
high-profile effort to stop the
Legislature and Gov. Rick Scott
from killing it.
It’s not surprising Millennium would have thrown such
a public life preserver to the

One was shown with a bullet
between his eyes.
A final slide showed a series
of body bags, each with a toe tag
identifying the dead: competing
companies, and, again, Zicari.
Price summed up, “If you
are in this room, you have
been chosen. You are part of
the family and we can protect you.” But, said the lawyer, if anyone chose to leave,
‘We will no longer provide you
with protection.”
Shaken, Strain immediately called another ex-employee, Lori Wilson, and Zicari.
Though he had not confirmed
who hired them, Zicari already
had determined that private
investigators were staking out
his house and following his car.
Ten days later, Strain said in
a suit she brought against Millennium, Price, the Millennium lawyer, called her and specifically asked whether she
had called the ex-employee, and whether they had discussed the PowerPoint.
Strain was fired.

database effort. Even as illicit schemes fattened the bottom line, both Slattery and the
company positioned Millennium as the ethical leader in an
industry beset by corruption.
The same year AHCA told
Bondi’s office about Millennium’s kickback strategy, Millennium helped push through
a new Florida law cracking
down on shady lab operators.
Millennium President Howard Appel said it reflected the
company’s broader national strategy, “to highlight the
need for ethics and compliance in the industry by whatever means necessary.”
In October, DO J unveiled
its case against Millennium,
detailing kickbacks, bribes
and inflated billings to Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health companies stretching to 2008.
The company agreed to pay
$256 million to resolve the
case and remain in the Medicare program.
Of the $8.9 million to settle
excessive drug testing claims
involving Florida Medicaid,
the state keeps $4.6 million;
the federal government keeps
the rest.
Slattery no longer heads the
company he created. But he
left with a windfall, records
show. After payments to the
government, companies he
controls and family trusts ended up with an estimated $500
million.
CMS, meanwhile, wasn’t
swayed by Bondi’s argument.
Facing increasing evidence of
overbilling for drug screens,
it has clamped down on such
payments.

Remember, though,
that texture plays a
pivotal role in this dish.
By Ari LeVaux
Special to Cox Newspapers

I’ve often pondered why
noodles are so yummy, and
were it not for the fact that
some of the answers are integral to the recipe of the day,
Pho Ap Chao Bo, I would caution against pondering this
too deeply. Like the question of why the sky is blue, the
answer — something about
light waves and stuff — just
isn’t as satisfying as the unanswered question. Alas, if we
wish to enjoy true noodle bliss
in our own homes, and not
depend on pros in restaurant
kitchens to take us there blindfolded, we must go there ourselves.
Because not all noodles, or
the dishes made from them,
take us to the textural places
that rice noodles can. And lets
face it, noodles are all about
texture. Nobody eats them for
the flavor.
Rice noodles are gods
among noodles, thanks to
their forgiving yet robust
chewiness. But another
important quality of these
starchy strands is their readiness to trade in their softness
for a crisp. Or, most importantly, their capacity to be
both chewy and crispy at the
same time, like an electron
that is both particle and wave.
The crispy and soft parts interact differently with the sauce,
adding diversity and complexity to the dish.

my radar during my time as a
restaurant critic in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Some might

Fraud, say Department of Justice
prosecutors, made James Slattery a
rich man.
But while the 64-year-old founder of
Millennium Laboratories coughed up
tens of millions to settle civil charges
linked to his drug-screening company’s

practices, he stands to walk away with
hundreds of millions more.
That’s because Millennium didn’t
just bilk Medicare and Florida Medicaid, as the Justice Department charged
in October.
Some of Wall Street’s biggest players
collectively loaned the company $1.8
billion in 2014, money that was going to
be repaid in part with the proceeds of
the company’s illicit schemes.
The lion’s share of the cash, $1.2 billion, went to Millennium’s true owners:

WASHINGTON — President

Barack Obama on Tuesday
tried to reconcile his optimistic assessment of the nation’s
progress with the anxieties he
conceded have gripped Americans during his tenure, using
his final State of the Union
address to try to burnish his
record and frame the campaign to succeed him.
In a prime-time speech that

was more a broad statement
of his vision than a policy prescription, Obama sought to
paint a hopeful portrait of the
nation after seven years in
office, with a resurgent economy and better standing in the
world despite ongoing challenges of inequality at home
and terrorism abroad.
But he acknowledged that
many Americans feel frightened and shut out of a political and economic system they
view as rigged against their
interests, even as he offered an
implicit rebuke of Republicans
who are citing those insecurities in the presidential race.
“As frustration grows, there
will be voices urging us to fall

POWERBALL

Powerball

By Matt Morgan
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer

Bill Bymel doesn’t consider himself a lottery player, but
the world’s largest lottery jackpot has him shelling out significant cash for tickets and a
dream.
The real estate investor
would use some of the $1.5 billion Powerball prize to buy
some houses throughout the
country, and use more to start
a charity.
“That’s probably the happiest part of my day: dreaming
what I would do with the money,” said Bymel of Jupiter, who
spent about $200 for lottery
tickets for Saturday’s drawing and said he will again for
today’s record drawing.
For Bymel, it’s just about the
odds, even if it moves the needle just a little. He would rather buy lots of tickets for a big
prize than buy a ticket or two a

THE PALM BEACH POST REAL NEWS STARTS HERE | WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 13, 2016

Millennium
continued from A1

an offshoot of the investment firm TA Associates,
which acted as adviser on the loan deal, and,
through a series of trusts
and companies, James
Slattery.
Because investment
bankers, money managers and pension fund
advisers all joined to loan
Millennium the money,
bits and pieces of the loan
— and its fallout — have
trickled down into such
unexpected places as the
retirement portfolios of
California firefighters and
New Mexico’s state investment fund.
Google got a slice of
the bad loan. So did Cornell University and the
Kaiser Foundation. Pension funds for FedEx and
Coca-Cola took a hit,
along with retirement
accounts for teachers in
Maryland and government employees in Illinois and Oregon.
Late last year, Millennium agreed to pay the government $256 million to
settle kickback and fraud
charges. As part of the
Justice Department agreement, it filed Chapter 11
bankruptcy. Wall Street
lenders now own the
firm, but it’s a poor prize:
Millennium did not have
enough money to pay
the penalties, much less
repay $1.8 billion.
Millennium’s testing approach won support from Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi
in a 2014 letter to federal officials, even as Bondi’s office investigated the
company. Bondi told The
Palm Beach Post on Friday that she had no idea
the letter would be “misused to assist a corrupt
company under investigation” and that “the letter should not have been
sent.”
Millennium’s loan collapse sent shudders
through Wall Street,
which in recent years
has embraced such loan
deals — the same type of
loans that played a role in
the 2008 housing market
meltdown.
No one is getting their
money back from Slattery. Although he was on
the hook for part of the
$256 million settlement,
the bankruptcy court
plan protects Slattery,
TA Associates and others
from civil suits brought by
burned investors.
As a result, Slattery
stands to keep hundreds of millions of dollars he collected from the
defunct loan. He keeps his
Fort Lauderdale mansion,
properties in two other
states and a near-priceless collection of vintage
aircraft. He and Millennium declined comment for
this story.
“For the little steal they
throw you in jail, but for
the big steal, they give
you a slap on the hand
and send you back to the
country club,” said Patrick Burns, co-director of
Washington, D.C.-based
Taxpayers Against Fraud,
which advocates on
behalf of whistleblowers.
“I refer to this as ‘the
big wink.’”

‘Culture of greed’

Slattery came to the
drug-screening business
with no formal medical
background. He served on
an aeronautics board in
Massachusetts, was in law
enforcement and Florida real estate and, according to Millennium, started
a satellite network company.
In 2007, he was diagnosed with a brain tumor.
“At 55, I was faced with
the decision to retire, or
to fight and recoup and
start the next chapter,”
he told San Diego Source
in 2011.
He moved to California, where it took him just
seven years to build Millennium into the largest
drug-screening lab in the
country.
Capitalizing on both
the explosion of prescription pain medication and
the resulting crackdown
on abuses, Millennium
offered doctors and clinics sophisticated urine
tests to confirm whether
or not patients were taking drugs.

lennium as a leader in
addiction research, effective pain management
and lab ethics. He chaired
Florida’s fledgling Prescription Drug Monitoring
Program, winning praise
from state officials.
Money poured in. A
pilot and aviation buff,
Slattery collected a stable
of World War II and vintage aircraft worth millions, several owned by
companies with the same
name: Pissed Away.
He bought homes in
three states. One of his
trusts financed the Greatest Generation Naval
Museum outside San
Diego, where vintage aircraft are open to the public. He pledged $6 million
toward another aviation
museum in Colorado.
A regional finalist for
Ernst & Young’s prestigious Entrepreneur of
the Year award in 2011,
Slattery told San Diego
Source, “I am most proud
of our culture. It’s a
good and happy place to
work.”
But behind the scenes,
federal prosecutors concluded, Millennium
thrived on “a culture of
greed, intimidation, and
intense sales pressure”
that originated from the
top.
The Justice Department charged in October
that Millennium reaped
millions by persuading
and bribing doctors to
needlessly test Medicare
patients for a sweeping
array of drugs they were
unlikely to use. It racked
up $15 million in Medicare
billings alone from testing
for the street drug angel
dust.
It rigged research
results. It lavished watches, jewelry, gift cards and
electronics on Florida
medical office staff.
And some employees
found its culture threatening. At one sales meeting, after Slattery took
the podium, $2 million in
gold coins were brought
in, a display of his personal wealth.
Then, the company’s
general counsel delivered
a mocked-up slide presentation showing a former
employee as a target with
a bullet hole between
his eyes. Another slide
showed body bags bearing toe tags with names of
competitors.

Major lenders sign on

The sun was just coming up on the San Diego
headquarters of Millennium on March 28, 2014,
when an email landed in
the inbox at Voya Investment Management, a firm
managing $35 billion in
pension assets.
It was an invitation to
a loan.
Millennium wanted $1.8
billion. Collateral included its balance sheet: millions in revenue generated by urine drug screens.
Investing in such corporate loans, known as leveraged loans, is dicey. No
single lender was going to
take on all of the risk.
Instead, JP Morgan
Chase arranged multiple
lenders for Millennium.
When Millennium formally opened the deal to
investors in a conference
call, market giants including BlackRock, OppenheimerFunds and Inves-

longer had enough money to pay.

Dividends come first

When the
loan deal
opened,
market giants
signed up.

When Millennium
pledged to pay back
Wall Street lenders with
the proceeds of such
schemes, “They monetized a fraud,” said Marc
Vezina, who represented the Brevard doctors’
group filing the whistleblower suit.

co jumped on board. So
did Voya.
And why not? The market for drug testing was
growing along with efforts
to crack down on abuse
of opioid drugs such as
OxyContin. Millennium
was among the largest of
the companies cashing
in. And, as it told investors, there were no existing government investigations, proceedings or lawsuits, either real or threatened, that could materially affect its bottom line
and derail its rosy financial future.
That was not true.

Risky loan bundles

Targeted by CMS

Well before it borrowed
the $1.8 billion, Millennium hired the influential Skadden Arps law firm
to deal with the Justice
Department investigation.
The company had turned
over about 11 million pages of documents to the
department, a clear indication that prosecutors’
interest was not casual.
Florida’s Medicaid
Fraud Unit had been
investigating since 2012 —
small wonder, as the practice of giving away expensive urine-specimen collection cups to doctors, as
Millennium did, had been
declared a kickback by
Florida as early as 2008.
Whistleblower suits
filed by former employees and a Brevard County
doctors’ group were consolidated in Massachusetts, site of a 2012 federal
grand jury hearing on Millennium.
Even more critical to
the company’s ability to
repay the loan, the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services was
asking questions. Medicare was Millennium’s single largest source of revenue.
CMS has the authority to bar Millennium from
participating in Medicare — which is exactly
what CMS formally told
the company it was going
to do, just months after
investors loaned the company $1.8 billion. Millennium had overbilled
Medicare $42 million,
investigators said.
That’s not why CMS
was preparing to oust
the company: Millennium also had billed for lab
work on 59 dead people,
CMS found.

The loan trickled
through the markets and
landed everywhere.
Some of it popped up in
the $300 billion California
Public Employees’ Retirement System, the nation’s
largest public pension
system. Some of it was
held by New Mexico’s
State Investment Council, which uses its investment returns to help pay
for running the state government.
Some bits were bundled with bits of other
loans and sold as collateralized loan obligations.
One of those landed in the
portfolio of a money manager for Florida’s state
retirement fund.
CLOs are almost entirely unregulated and not at
all new. They crashed and
burned in the 2008 housing market meltdown
right along with collateralized debt obligations
(CDOs), the better-known
and equally calamitous
bundles of mortgages sold
to investors.
But unlike CDOs, CLOs
— bundles of high-yield,
high-risk leveraged loans
— are back in vogue with
investors frustrated by
low interest rates.
Once bundled as
CLOs, leveraged loans
are sold as though they
are a stock. They are not
a security, though, and
so there’s no government regulation specifying what the borrower has
to reveal to prospective
lenders. Even major institutional investors gamble
that the company borrowing the money is forthcoming about all the facts
related to its ability to
repay.
TA Associates has since
stated in court filings that
it wasn’t necessary to tell
lenders about the Justice
Department investigation
because it already was
publicly known: a news
service had published a
story in 2012 about the
Massachusetts grand jury.
So, it wasn’t until May,
just about one year after
the loan had wound its
way through Wall Street,
and after months of back
and forth with the Justice Department, that Millennium told its lenders
it was on the hook to the
government for a quarter-billion dollars.
Millennium, though, no

When the $1.8 billion
began flowing into the
company’s coffers, $1.27
billion flowed right out
again as “special dividends” to a select few.
The biggest recipients,
according to lenders: TA
Associates, a Massachusetts-based investment
firm that advised Millennium, and Slattery, who
through multiple trust
funds and two corporations effectively owned
more than half of Millennium.
Millennium was left
with 30 cents for every
dollar it borrowed,
though it bore full responsibility for paying back all
of the $1.8 billion.
This is what leveraged
loans traditionally do,
explained Wolf Richter, a
financial blogger who has
written about the Millennium loan.
Loan money comes in
the company’s front door,
but rather than being
used to grow the company, the cash is allocated to insiders as a dividend. “The company
incurs the liability of the
loan, but the money gets
sucked out the back door”
as insiders cash in, said
Richter.
It is, he said, a very efficient “wealth transfer
mechanism.”
Voya isn’t averse to
either leveraged loans
or CLOs, but, its attorneys wrote in court filings, “Millennium was
effectively operated as an
elaborate mechanism to
obtain hundreds of millions of dollars ... under
false pretenses, first from
the government and then,
once the government was
closing in, from lenders.”

Keeping the house

Voya wants its money
back.
It won’t be easy.
When TA Associates,
Slattery and the Justice
Department hammered
out a settlement deal, it
became apparent that Millennium didn’t have the
money to pay the $256
million penalty.

As the owners of Millennium, Slattery and TA
Associates agreed to pay
$325 million, enough to
satisfy the government
and give Millennium money to keep operating. As
part of the plan, Millennium would reorganize in
bankruptcy court.
Even after paying the
$325 million, TA Associates and Slattery’s businesses and trusts are left
with almost $1 billion —
money from the big loan.
Just as important, the
bankruptcy court plan
gave Slattery and TA
one more thing they had
demanded: protection.
Pensions, nonprofits
and other investors holding the bag for the collapsed loan are all barred
from suing TA, Slattery and dozens more.
That leaves lenders who
believe Slattery and TA
defrauded them with no
ability to sue to get their
money back.
A spokeswoman for
the Department of Justice
said it had no role in creating the immunity provision. “Millennium independently proposed and
obtained confirmation
of a Chapter 11 plan that
included ... releases for
Millennium, James Slattery and TA Associates,”
she said.
But it’s unclear whether the Justice Department
would have gotten its
money without the immunity.
Slattery and TA would
not pay the federal penalty unless they also got
the legal protection, court
documents show. If the
penalty wasn’t paid, Millennium would be booted
from Medicare, the company could collapse and
no one, including the Justice Department, would
see their money.
“They had the government over a barrel,” one
observer said.
Last month, TA Associates and Slattery paid up,
turning over $256 million
to the Justice Department.
Slattery’s companies
and trusts paid more
than half. That still leaves
Slattery’s interests with
an estimated $380 million from his share of the
now-defunct loan.
Today, Slattery and his
wife, a registered nurse,
live in a $5 million mansion on the Intracoastal
Waterway in Fort Lauderdale.
In 2013, the Slatterys
gave the property to one
of the several Slattery
family trusts that owned
most of Millennium, and,
say Voya’s lawyers, stood
to receive part of the $1.27
billion.
“It’s just ridiculous,”
Burns said. “People who
pocket millions by stealing from taxpayers get to
keep their beach houses.”
Meanwhile, a civil racketeering suit filed against
Slattery and TA by Voya
is on hold, pending an
appeal of the immunity
provision.
Given Voya’s litigation,
“I don’t think it is over,”
Burns said. “But the core
question for DO J in this
suit and in almost every
other is: Are they going to
allow the big wink to go
on?”
