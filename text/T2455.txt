THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX---DOING BIGGER, BETTER
INVESTIGATIONS

--At the start of any investigation, always ask yourself:
-How can I do this differently than everyone else? How can I do it bigger
and better?

--Find a partner in your newsroom, and brainstorm together

--Always "Go Deep"... go "the extra mile" to take your investigation to it's fullest
conclusion

--Don't neglect the "storytelling" aspect of your investigation. Great information is
lost on the viewer if it's not
compellingly told

--Think of the little thingsmall things you can do to make your story bigger and
better, e.g., a new way to do a confrontation or
stand-ups

--Look for the little, visual details that make a story bigger (e.g., a video image that
speaks 1000 words)

--Depth and substance can make a piece bigger and better. If necessary, divide the
story into two shows
