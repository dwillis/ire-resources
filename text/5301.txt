BULLETPROOFING
YOUR REPORTING

WHAT IS
BULLETPROOFING?

WHY
BULLETPROOF?

I can tell a story here about publishing a massive error at my first job in 122 point font on the front page. We said that the county had $4 billion in taxable revenue. It was
actually $4 million (Duh). The problem was some crummy system the IT guy set up for us because they didn‚Äôt trust us to handle data.

MAKE A PLAN

KNOW WHERE YOUR
DATA IS FROM

‚Ä¢ Walk through a single record.
‚Ä¢ Where did it come from? When?
‚Ä¢ Apply regular reporting.
‚Ä¢ Recreate a known benchmark.

Point here is that you should know what the data actually represents? I can talk about FDA AERS as an example ‚Äî represents all complaints made TO COMPANIES, for
the most part. That‚Äôs a huge component to understand when you‚Äôre writing from the data, as companies have been forced to be more and more responsive.
The recreating benchmark point also goes right to getting someone at the agency to guide you. Often, if you can‚Äôt recreate, it leads you to inoÔ¨Äensive questions about
just how the data works.

DON‚ÄôT FORGET
Create a file for your data:
dictionary
Keep a file of all the queries and
questions you ask your data:
data diary

YOUR

A dictionary for ^data

Important to know what every field means, not just the ones that immediately seem important. Remember the old federal contract db ‚Äî A meant ‚Äúpaid‚Äù, B meant ‚Äúpaid
back.‚Äù Oy.

Make your work reproducible

STOP THIS!üóëüî•

STOP THIS

GOOD HEADERS & CLEAN DATA

Keep track of your work

Keep notes as you go, use standard naming conventions, keep track of issues with data you will need to document in your methodology

QUESTIONS YOU
SHOULD ASK YOUR DATA

Missing data?
Duplicates?
Check methodology, outliers,range of fields
Spelling?
Limits in MySQL or Excel
Names?

ANOVA! Number one way to make sure you understand your data, imho

‚Ä¢ Overestimate the time it will take
‚Ä¢ Run the analysis not just once, but

several times
‚Ä¢ Circle EVERY FACT and check
independently.
