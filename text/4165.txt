GOODS AND SERVICES
IRE Conference - 2014 San Francisco
Broadcast: Consumer investigations
Jun 27th 2014
4:45PM - 6:15PM
With so many thanks to some of the best in the business who, in the IRE spirit “gave it up” so
we could all be better at what we do.
Below you’ll find quick hits and deep digging requiring data and documents. You’ll find
testing and hidden camera work and confrontations to get to the truth. Consumer stories
lend themselves to investigative reporting – have at it!

---------------------------------------------------------------------ADVERTISING
CAR DASHES MAY BE NEXT FRONTIER IN TARGETED ADVERTISING: Location based ads are
popping up in dashboards across the country, and location is just the beginning of the trend.
Advertisers are targeting consumers by their vehicle type, the music they listen to, and anything else
they may do with their dash. Julie Watts – KPIX Channel 5 (San Francisco) julie@juliewatts.net
TRIED AND TRUE: CAR ADS: Bait and Switch. Check out those car ads – take a look at the numbers
they include and then try to get them. Ha – in almost all cases you can’t.

NEW FIRESTONE TIRES: I did this angle as part of ABC’s national tire project…having done the
general story in November. We focused on Bridgestone/Firestone’s federal filings, which reveal a large
group of its tires from its infamous recall are still unaccounted for. Look under an old Explorer (and
there are plenty out there) and you may find one in the spare tire well. We did, on our very first try. We
also found a recalled tire for sale in a used tire shop. You can buy them on EBay right now. Original
story that launched the ABC project:

risk? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN9zPnaAWOQ Kurtis Ming CBS13 (KOVR

TRIED AND TRUE: OIL CHANGE: High-pressure sales and shoddy work done by 10-minute oil
changers.
TRIED AND TRUE: CAR KEYS: Get the VIN numbers off cars – go to dealers to see if they will give
you the keys for those cars.
TRIED AND TRUE: GAS PRICES; If gas prices go up – who has the cheapest prices and where?
Get viewers to crowd source
TRIED AND TRUE: “BACK END OF THE DEAL”: Take a close look at all those papers people sign
when they buy a car – you’ll find outrageous prices on things consumers don’t even know they are
buying.
TRIED AND TRUE: TOW TRUCKS: poke around in your local licensing agency’s files and you’ll likely
find complaints of abusive tow truck operators.

TRIED AND TRUE: SQUEAKY WHEEL GETS THE GREASE: It's easy to do a series on how to
complain to companies and enforcement agencies, and show how it can pay off with little effort. It's a
good marketing story because you can publish a reference guide with contact info for attorney general,
county consumer protection offices, BBB's, etc.

THE GRAY MARKET - WHAT ARE YOUR REALLY BUYING ON EBAY OR THE INTERNET?: The
internet is now a world of gray market on almost everything imaginable – electronics, luxury goods, you
name it. How do you know if it is authentic? How do you know if that warranty you are getting is real?
Tell people how to tell and warn them that gray market isn’t always what you think it is and even if it is
the real deal it may not come with a warranty like the product bought in a retail store.

BUSTING CLEANING THIEVES: Lots of people suspect their cleaning service is stealing from them.
So we rigged up an apartment with hidden cameras and put a cleaning service (accused by several
customers of stealing) to the test. Just be careful - they might stealing your cameras (which happened
to us!) But it made for a heck of a story:

WSMV-TV (Nashville) Jeremy.Finley@wsmv.com
AIR CONDITIONING: Too many air conditioning firms are not putting enough Freon in people’s air
conditioners but, of course, they are asking them to pay full price. All you need is a ride along with a
regulator and his/her equipment.
AC REPLACEMENT: AC guys tell people that the unit needs to be replaced and shows the home
owner burnt wires. Get an AC contractor to show how an unscrupulous contractor can make sparks fly
on an AC. Melanie Payne (News Press – Fort Myers – Southwest, FL) MPayne@news-press.com
TRIED AND TRUE: AIR CONDITIONING CHECKUP: Do they top off the Freon “too much” – do they
overcharge?
TRIED AND TRUE: WATER FILTERS: Capture a sales pitch on tape. Some will test the water and find
disgusting potentially "deadly" things. The terrorism angle is hot right now.
TRIED AND TRUE: COMPUTER REPAIR: Break some and take them around to see if you get ripped
off.
TRIED AND TRUE: HAIR CUTTING DEALS: You can't get the advertised price unless you have very
short hair and walk out wet.
TRIED AND TRUE: LOCKSMITH: Call a few - see if they will let you into a home that is not yours...a
car that is not yours
TRIED AND TRUE: BASEMENT WATERPROOFING: There are far too many sleazy operators in the
business and they are easy to catch - all you need is an honest engineer and a few homes that have
simple water problems. It is a guaranteed story and these guys rip people off at $10-15,000 a pop.
EDUCATION
ARE THEY EDUCATING OR PLAYING SPORTS?: Take a look at some of the “prep” schools that
promise an education and perhaps a college scholarship for a sport. Are these kids getting an
education or are they wasting their time? Tisha Thompson (WRC-TV, Washington)

TRIED AND TRUE: COLLEGE COSTS: Wonder why the cost of college in your area has skyrocketed take a serious look at where the money is going - salaries, perks, etc.
TRIED AND TRUE: BUSINESS SCHOOLS: Some don't teach you much but they make a huge profit
off the government
TRIED AND TRUE: SCHOOL BUS ROULETTE: Each state must inspect school buses and keep
records in order to get federal funding. A look at those records would show that many school buses are
on the road with bad bushing, brakes, king pins, etc. You may find that after problems are found they
are never fixed. Many school districts don't even have racks to put the buses up on.
FOOD/GROCERY/RESTAURANTS
WHERE YOUR FOOD COMES FROM. Big interest these days among consumers who are trying to eat
fresh, local food. A quick shopping trip with a Go-Pro camera and some MOS’s can get you an
interesting story. http://www.click2houston.com/news/where-does-your-food-come-from-labels-dont-tellentire-story/26065824 Amy Davis (KPRC - Houston) adavis@kprc.com
CHINESE CHICKENS: Did you know a new law will allow US manufacturers to ship slaughtered
chickens that were grown in America to China for processing? They can then send the chicken back to
the US for sale. http://www.click2houston.com/news/concerns-rising-over-china-processing-uschicken/26071436
Amy Davis (KPRC - Houston) adavis@kprc.com
EXPIRED FOOD: In many states the only expired food you can’t sell is baby formula. So who
regulates sell dates, are there some stores that sell more of it, what do you do if you buy some, etc.

BEEF PRICES: Health-conscious consumers pay more money for leaner ground beef; but are you
really getting what you pay for? http://www.click2houston.com/news/local-2-puts-ground-beef-labels-tothe-test/22923214 Amy Davis (KPRC - Houston) adavis@kprc.com

RESTAURANT DINERS COMPLAIN OF ‘TIP PADDING’: Be careful when you use your credit cards
at a restaurant, or hold on to your receipts tightly. Some restaurant employees might be sneaking a few
extra dollars onto the final bill. Julie Watts – KPIX Channel 5 (San Francisco) julie@juliewatts.net
DIRTY RESTAURANTS: What happens to your complaint when the environmental health department
gets it. Find a restaurant inspector who will spill the dirt…what do they look for when they eat out? IRE

2014 - CONSUMER STORIES – page seven
EVERYONE eats…so this has a wide audience and plays well. Tanya Rivera – WFMY2 (Greensboro,
North Carolina) trivera@wfmy.com
DIRTY DINING: Grab those health department inspection reports, do some data work, make sure
everything is oranges to oranges and you have stories for weeks. You can do restaurants (fast and
family and even luxury, hometown or chain), you can do who got shut down that week or reopened, you
can do carryout and street food and the best and the worst in your town, city, state.
FARMERS MARKETS: Who is regulating them – who is checking out where the food came from and
how clean the farm are? They are all the rage, everyone wants to buy local but what are you really
buying. Is that organic stuff really organic? Are those chickens really raised with no antibiotics, what are
they really eating? Take a camera…do the markets look clean, do people really wash their hands in
those porta johns before they sell you their meat? Ashley Reynolds
http://www.ky3.com/news/local/farmers-markets-set-own-safety-health-standards-for-foodsellers/21048998_26485018 Ashley Reynolds KY3 (Springfield, Missouri) areynolds@ky3.com
via schurz.com
STADIUM FOOD: Who is inspected it, where does it come from, are the rules for sanitation different?
PAPER TOWELS: A six-pack of paper towels could actually have fewer sheets than smaller packs
because the rolls are actually smaller. The pricing is all over the place. Count the sheets per roll and
calculate the real price per sheet. Elizabeth Crenshaw (WRC-TV – Washington)
TRIED AND TRUE: Test for the best – or the worse. Take a look at product labels, open up and count
what is really inside. Frozen foods are always a good challenge. Check the competition – is it just as
bad or can you pick a winner.
TRIED AND TRUE: OUTDATED BABY FORMULA: Remember, it is the sole source of nutrition for very
young babies so if age makes vitamins and minerals drop out that is a problem. Work with a
pediatrician. Seems to be a bigger problem in mom and pop stores.
TRIED AND TRUE: ADULTERATED GROUND BEEF: Simple tests will show if local grocery stores are
combining many types of meat in their “ground beef”. Are they also wrapping fresh meat around old
meat?
FRAUD
TRIED AND RUE: TELLING FORTUNES - TAKING FORTUNES: Send somebody in with a hidden
camera - its a guaranteed story on how fortunetellers talk people into spending thousands of dollars have to be careful though - in each city almost all fortune tellers are members of the same family.
TRIED AND TRUE: CARNIVAL GAMES: Why you can’t win at the carnival games
TRIED AND TRUE: PAGEANT PROMISES: A fraud built on the egos and vanity of little girl's mothers.
Great picture story - most of the "guys" in these schemes are making their money off pictures and
videos.

HEALTH – HUMANS AND PETS/HEALTH INSURANCE
ACA HEALTH INSURANCE PROVIDER DIRECTORIES: Health insurers are notorious for having
outdated lists of doctors. Log on to the state health exchange and pull up the provider directories for
each insurer that consumers use to determine which insurance plan they want to sign up for. Generally
people pick plans based on whether or not their doctor is covered. We found a widespread bait and
switch as they sign up, only to find out their doctor is not accepting their insurance. Then pull public
records from state regulators and check the lists that insurers submitted to them as part of their network
adequacy filings. We’ve found as many as one third of the doctors on some of those lists are either not
accepting the plan, are duplicates, or are dead. This violates both state and federal laws. Many of the
remaining doctors listed are refusing to take new patients under the plans being sold on the state
insurance exchange. This leads to network adequacy issues as patients can’t get timely appointments
with the few remaining doctors in their area. Julie Watts – KPIX Channel 5 (San Francisco)
julie@juliewatts.net
DENTAL UPSELLS: Are dentists upselling you on services you don’t need?

interaction. www.epa.gov/myenvironment/ Kelly Hatmaker (KATU-TV, Portland, Oregon)
khatmaker@katu.com
HEALTH INSURANCE COMPLAINTS: It wasn’t just people enrolled in the Affordable Care Act who ran
into long wait times and frustrations with their insurance. We went to our state health insurance
regulator and asked for complaint data and we compared that to what was being reported on social
media and told people how to get answers
http://www.nbcbayarea.com/investigations/Health-Insurance-Complaints-Skyrocket-in-CA256064851.html Vicky Nguyen (KNTV, San Francisco) Victoria.Nguyen@nbcuni.com
TRIFEXIS: The most popular flea killer and heartworm prevention medicine for dogs has, at last count,
killed more than 700 pets according to complaints filed with FDA by pet owners, vets and manufacturer
Elanco. I had to get the numbers from FDA through FOIA, and am awaiting an update. When I
reported that number…Trifexis complaints of death had outnumbered jerky treats.

ECIGS: I found 57 Vape stores opened in GA in the past 3 years. ECigs (and the juice that feeds
them) is now part of a growing industry. FDA’s proposed rules will make manufacturers get a
license and disclose ingredients. It’s not hard to find a new vape maker concerned about losing a

PRESCRIPTION GLASSES: Are eyeglass stores accurately making
lenses? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g7hDsvB1aE Kurtis Ming CBS13 (KOVR

TRIED AND TRUE: CME DOC MANUFACTURER CLASSES: Continuing medical education courses
required for docs are operated by drug and device manufacturers. Are these CME classes sales
seminars in disguise?
TRIED AND TRUE: CANCER QUACKS: Read the classifieds - watch for ads in city magazines
TRIED AND TRUE: DIRTY POOLS: Chlorine levels in pools have to be carefully monitored and
adjusted for the chemical to do its job. If you tested pools, you might find levels too low to kill bacteria
like e-coli.
TRIED AND TRUE: NUTRITION TESTS: Visit nutritionists and chiropractors that sell dietary
supplements and expose the tests they use to convince consumers to buy vitamins, herbs, etc. Check
out the iris test, the saliva test, and the hair test.
TRIED AND TRUE: HOSPITAL BILLS: Take a look at the gimmickry hospitals use to pad the bill – and
we all pay in added health costs.
TRIED AND TRUE: BAD DOCS: Public Citizen www.citizen.org is a terrific resource for an
investigation into incompetent doctors and a state’s failure to protect the public from them.
IT publishes lists of questionable doctors in some of the state’s with the worse disciplinary records.
Check your state’s Department of Insurance or Department of Financial Services for malpractice
payouts by doctors. Chances are their insurance companies settled suits when they were indefensible.
Victims: Check your state Department of Health for substantiated complaints. Names will probably be
redacted but once you have the health department’s records cross check the date of death and the
victim’s initials with deaths from the Medical Examiners office and death certificates from vital statistics.
Florida, and some other states, allow doctors to practice without carrying malpractice insurance but
they are supposed to provide certifiable proof that they can cover the cost of a lawsuit and any damage
award. They are also by law supposed to disclose to their clients that they have no insurance. But
many shoddy doctors fail to carry the insurance, don’t have the resources set aside to pay for a lawsuit
and fail to disclose it to their patients. When this law applies, the disclosure must be visible to anyone
who walks into their office. You can find victims quite easily through lawsuits where the doctors can’t
pay his victim. In some states doctors must file a report with the health department when something
goes wrong during a surgery. Pull the surgical reports if your state makes them available and cross
check what the doctor says happened to other findings like the medical examiner or state health
investigator. Check the status of the licenses of doctors, nurses and technicians that are subjects of
your investigation. You will be surprised how many people you will find that are practicing without a
license, which is generally a felony

INEFFECTIVE LICENCING BOARDS: Georgia began fully enforcing licensing requirements on
contractors five years ago. Guess how many licenses they’ve revoked for shoddy work? ZERO! A
records request may reveal a similar track record in other states. Jim Strickland (WSB-TV, Atlanta)
strickland@wsbtv.com
RENTAL INSURANCE: Just exactly happens when you and your landlord get into a dispute about who
pays for what after a fire, flood, etc. Are you adequately covered, do you have replacement insurance,
etc.
TRIED AND TRUE: HOME INSPECTOR SHORTAGE: Poor home construction is a common
complaint, but too many shoddy homes pass inspection because the inspectors have no time to really
inspect.
TRIED AND TRUE: APARTMENT SEARCH FIRM: If they charge up front, sign up. The search firm
may only have just those apartments advertised in the papers - you will probably also find many listings
don't exist
INFASTRUCTURE
TRIED AND TRUE: DAMS: Chances are if your city or town is on a stream there is a dam upstream even if it is a farmers holding pond - a big storm could blow through it and it could be a disaster. Your
state must inspect the bigger ones - many of them are in disrepair.
TRIED AND TRUE: BRIDGES; Get your state’s inspection reports and head out with an inspector to
find the worst bridges in your area. Likely you will find holes in bridges, concrete breaking off…good
pictures. This is a data story – make sure it is apples to apples as you go through reports.
INSURANCE
CHEAP INSURANCE ADS: Can you really get insurance for $9 a month? Kurtis Ming CBS13 (KOVR

sometimes just to ask a question, the contact gets into a database. The more contacts you have, even
if they’re not claims, the more you’ll pay.

Salt Lake) mgephardt@kutv2.com
TRIED AND TRUE: DEBT CONSOLIDATORS: The jobless rate is high – people are in credit trouble.
Historically, when someone couldn’t pay they were referred to one of the free, non-profit Consumer
Credit Counseling Services around the country. But, now people are being enticed by "debt counseling
companies" who are spouting up all over the place. Unlike loan consolidators (you've seen those ads
too), these companies run a ton of TV and radio ads saying they are nonprofit, but many are that in name only. These companies are spiraling people into worse debt.
TRIED AND TRUE: SEIZED PROPERTY AND ESTATE AUCTIONS: Junk masquerading as seized
property or valuable estate contents. An expert can tell you what's what, and what's not and the
government can confirm when they are not official seized property auctions.
TRIED AND TRUE: ADVANCE FEE LOANS: Poor credit consumers pay upfront fees to obtain loans,
but never get the money. This is topping consumer complaints lists these days.
TRIED AND TRUE: JOB FINDERS: If they charge a lot of money up front, take a look.
TRIED AND TRUE: ANATOMY OF A HOSPITAL BILL: Take four or five bills and take them apart - a
20 cent plastic cup becomes a five dollar "urinal", a pacifier for a baby in the nursery costs $16.
Disposable slippers - $15. Sometimes you are charged not for what actually happens to you but for
what the "average" person pays.

PRICE MATCHING POLICIES: Are stores with low price guarantees, standing by their
policies? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8MIXwjg9ak Kurtis Ming CBS13 (KOVR

OVERCHARGING (Grocery Store, Drug Store, etc.): This generally works at any store with a lot of
“club card deals” or “daily specials.” You buy something based on the advertised “sale” price, but the
register rings you up at the original price. Stores like Safeway, Vons, Walgreens, CVS, Fresh & Easy,
& Kohls have all been sued in CA and are now required to offer you extra money back or items for free
if they overcharge you. Find out what day they change their specials (i.e. shelf tags) and go shopping
the next day. Odds are that you’ll get overcharged because they’ll have some old tags up and/or they
haven’t updated their computers
yet. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLa9rnaEtSHWUNoht7xX35g54WIfbeZHCI Julie Watts –

E-MAILED RECEIPTS CAN COST YOUR PRIVACY: The Consumer Federation of California says
once a store gets your email address, it can, and likely will, send you more emails , use it for

GOLD BUYING (Antiques, Jewelry, etc.): Are they shortchanging you? Shop your stuff to 4 or 5
different “buyers” and advise viewers on how to get the best price. You can also ask contact your local
Weights & Measures Department and ask them to test questionable gold scales. You may find national
road shows are particularly bad, send your stuff to affiliates in other states to prove the IRE
problem is widespread. Ask affiliates to replicate your “undercover” then share your findings.

BACK OF THE TRUCK STEREO SALESMEN: It’s a con so big it has its own Wikipedia page. The
salesmen cruise parking lots and offer what they call expensive home theater systems for pennies in
the dollar. But many customers say those claims are as empty as the equipment is cheap.

SCAMMING THE SCAMMER - BAD TICKETS: Any town that boasts big concerts will have crooks
making copies of legit concert tickets and then selling the copies to several victims. Since
Ticketmaster's printed off tickets look pretty generic, it's easily done. But if you work with victims, and
they can help you find the person who sold them the tickets - you can scam the scammers.

TRIED AND TRUE: INDIAN FAKE ART: In areas where Native American jewelry, art and other items
are sold, you'll probably find more cheap knock offs than authentic pieces. You can use an expert and
have jewelry tested (at a local university) to find out if the stones are real.
TRIED AND TRUE: DISCOUNT JEWELRY: Department stores sell at 50% off – but 50% off of what?
Check out department store ads over a period of time – notice jewelry is always 50% off. Also, appraise
some department store diamonds – you may find they appraise for a lot less than their sale price. WSB
found links in a JC Penney bracelet were hollow!
TRIED AND TRUE: BURIAL INSURANCE: It is almost always a rip-off.
TRIED AND TRUE: BABY PICTURES: Take a close look at the Sears, K Mart, Penny's baby picture
ads - show how it really works - almost no one gets the $14.95, in fact almost everyone spends well
over a $100 because of the way the pictures are taken.
TRIED AND TRUE: MOTEL ORIENTAL RUG SALES: Going on in almost every town across America
– take an expert with you – mike him/her – have them comment as each rug comes up and then

RECYCLED EMAIL ACCOUNTS POSING PRIVACY PROBLEM: Yahoo is giving away email

you have opted to use your own device at work be warned: that convenience could end up costing you
money and all your memories. Julie Watts – KPIX Channel 5 (San Francisco) julie@juliewatts.net
WHO IS WATCHING YOUR BABY – YOUR GRANDMOTHER?: They are great gizmos, often used to
monitor the elderly as well. But, get in your car/truck and see what you can pick up driving down the
street. Someone, sadly, picked up an old woman completely naked in her bedroom.
APP MAPS SOCIAL MEDIA POSTINGS, CREATES ‘BLUEPRINT’ OF PERSON’S MOVEMENT: The
next time your mobile phone prompts you to turn on its ‘location services’ function; you may want to
think twice about whether or not you click that ‘on’ button. Julie Watts – KPIX Channel 5 (San

FIRE EXTINGUISHERS: Where is yours & will it work? (we asked for Twitter pics of where their

moment for how to use an extinguisher the right way Tanya Rivera – WFMY2 (Greensboro, North

SMOKE ALARMS: The best way to test your alarm, is not the button. That tests the battery not if the

IRE 2014 - CONSUMER STORIES – page fifteen
THE GRILL THAT STARTED YOUR HOUSE FIRE: Too many people have their grill
just a foot away from their house. Within a few minutes (the time it takes you to go inside and get
cheese for the burgers and a get a drink) the siding on the house was bubbling up.
TRIED AND TRUE: HOME SECURITY: Ride along with the cops – most of their calls are home
security alarms going off that are false alarms - tremendous waste of their time and most police
departments don't rush to get to them which makes home security alarms pretty worthless – although
police say if you have a sign out front it might be a deterrent.
TRIED AND TRUE: FIRE EXTINGUISHERS: Walk through any school or apartment building and find
ones that don't work. If they are not recharged often, they just sputter.
TRIED AND TRUE: LINSEED OIL FIRES: Probably far more fires than people realize - put some
linseed oil soaked rags in a box - close it - it will start to smoke in a number of hours - be in full fire
shortly after.
TRIED AND TRUE: SMOKE DETECTORS: Many of them don't work - test them in all sorts of places
(business, home, government)- you'll find out many of them are missing batteries or aren't
hooked up to the electrical system - remember just pushing the button on them won't tell you if they are
operational - you have to use smoke from a candle to see if they really work.
TRIED AND TRUE: DRUNK DRIVING: A Minneapolis station went to the DMV - watched serious
offenders get their licenses taken away and then watched them go out to their cars and get in and drive
home. In most states, after the DMV takes action, no one ever checks up.
HOW SAFE ARE THE MUNICIPAL POOLS, THE HIGH SCHOOL POOLS, APARTMENT BUILDING
POOLS, ETC.: CBS Houston found many out of compliance, many woefully behind in fixing drain
covers that can suck you in and hold you down.
TRANSPORTATION
TRUCK GUARDS: First reported by Channel 6 in Indy, we revealed how the guards on the backs of
trucks to prevent under ride crashes are largely ineffective. Standards have not been upgraded since
1998 and there are no requirements for side under ride protection, despite those brand of crashes
making up a significant part of the fatalities. A few months after we did the story, NTSB recommended
the NHTSA strengthen standards. http://www.wsbtv.com/news/news/local/youll-never-look-tractortrailers-same-way-again/nb4Kf/ (includes follow-up) Jim Strickland (WSB-TV, Atlanta)

IRE 2014 - CONSUMER STORIES – page sixteen
TRANSIT TICKETS: No one likes to get a ticket for fare evasion. But are there problems with the
technology deducting the fares? We asked for data showing how many tickets were issued and how
many were appealed at the SFMTA and compared them to the stories from riders who claim they paid
their fare but broken or malfunctioning machines didn’t deduct their fare appropriately.

HIGHWAY SOUND WALLS: Ugly sound walls bordering the highway designed to curb noise often
don’t work, especially when they are the metal variety. Plus…Neighbors where they are newly installed
feel like they’re mice trapped in a maze…they can’t see anything. Trees crashing through the walls are
another issue. Jim Strickland (WSB-TV, Atlanta) strickland@wsbtv.com
TRAVEL
ONLINE TRAVEL BUYING: When you book travel through an online travel agent and something goes
wrong, the hotel/airline won't even work with you cause, technically, their customer is someone named
"Priceline." – this one got a lot of
reaction. http://kutv.com/news/features/gephardt/stories/vid_675.shtml Matt Gephardt (KUTV Salt
Lake) mgephardt@kutv2.com
BAGGAGE CHECK VS MAIL: Show the difference in price between checking bags at the airport vs.
having your luggage shipped. i got a UPS store to cooperate and put my stuff in a box and said what it
would cost to ship. I also interviewed a hotel that says they sometimes get the luggage from people
days before they arrive to save money and hassle at the airport. Plus gratuitous MOS at the airport with
people bitching about lost luggage and heavy luggage, etc. Matt Gephardt (KUTV Salt Lake)

Amy Davis (KPRC - Houston) adavis@kprc.com
DIGGING OVER LINES: Calling the utilities only covers you for a few days ... so if your yard project is
going to take a while and you hit a line, you can be
screwed. http://kutv.com/news/features/gephardt/stories/vid_656.shtml Matt Gephardt (KUTV Salt
Lake) mgephardt@kutv2.com
PROPANE PRICING AND REFILLS: Ask AG for complaints about propane and oil. You will probably
find a lot about companies who deliver (without permission) when customers don't want any fuel summertime and when prices are high. Hard to fight because many tanks were "rented" from the
company by previous homeowners - so the company locks you into exorbitant prices and can retaliate
by cutting off your fuel. Tisha Thompson (WRC-TV, Washington) tisha.thompson@nbcuni.com

phone bills. http://www.click2houston.com/news/spending-too-much-on-your-cell-phonebill/21361900
Amy Davis (KPRC - Houston) adavis@kprc.com
Wi-Fi – JUST HOW DANGEROUS IS IT?: We all hear about identity theft and other maladies of Wi-Fi
but most people still do their banking, shopping, etc. on the internet. Grab an expert and discuss the
realities of dealing on the internet, what the percentages are of someone being a victim and tell what
happens and what they must do if they are scammed on the internet. Tell people what they need to
save, who they need to be in touch with, etc. to protect themselves and is the cheapest way and what
to buy to keep safe.
THE VULNERABILITY OF WI-FI: Get in your car/truck and drive down any suburban street or city and
see how much free Wi-Fi you can pick up because people don’t lock their internet access.
Maureen Kelly found half of the homes in one area left their Wi-Fi open or unlocked.
COMMON MISAPPLIED TAX ON ELECTRIC BILLS: Help viewers get refunds for hundreds of dollars.

Amy Davis (KPRC - Houston) adavis@kprc.com
HIGH WATER BILLS: When we began investigating skyrocketing water bills in Atlanta, we found
examples around the country where the bills didn't make sense. Some of this is due to incorrect meter
readings or faulty installations. Government oversight of the city water department may be weak. This
is a document-heavy story, but one that will resonate with viewers who can't solve their water woes.
This one got a huge reaction, and we are still getting e-mails years later.
http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/03/01/water.bills.war/ Scott Zamost CNN Scott.Zamost@cnn.com
MINING CITY WEBSITES: Check out the city or county or state websites – look for water leaks and
gallons lost for instance at the water department. Look for injuries, contractor costs, overruns, etc.

CONSUMER FEDERATION OF AMERICA TOP TEN COMPLAINTS IN 2013 (edited)
1. Auto
Auto sales once again topped the list - misleading advertising for new and used cars, faulty repairs,
leasing and towing disputes and getting suckered into buying lemons.
2. Home Improvement/Construction
Shoddy work, as well as failure to start or finish the work altogether.
3. Credit/Debt
Billing and fee disputes, mortgage-related fraud, predatory lending, illegal or abusive debt-collection
tactics and questionable credit repair services.
4. Utilities
Service and billing disputes including phone, cable, satellite, Internet, electric and gas companies.
5. Retail Sales
False or deceptive advertising, defective merchandise and problems with rebates, coupons and gift
cards.

IRE 2014 - CONSUMER STORIES – page nineteen
6. Services
Misrepresentations and subpar and unlicensed work from service providers, like moving and
transportation companies..
7. Home Solicitations
Misrepresentations from door-to-door salespeople, telemarketers and mail solicitations, and violations
of the "do not call" registry.
8. Landlord/Tenant
Renters reported unhealthy or unsafe housing conditions, deposit and rent disputes, illegal eviction
tactics and a failure to make repairs.
9. Internet Sales
Deceptive practices from online retailers as well as failed deliveries. Online shoppers fell prey to free
trial offers that resulted in high charges, also fraudulent magazine sales.
10. Household Goods
Misrepresentations about the goods and faulty repairs.
SCAMBUSTERS.COM OUTLOOK FOR BIGGEST FRAUDS IN 2014 (edited)
1. Phishing and ID theft. The bad news is that we think the gap between this and other scams will
widen, with newly digitized medical databases as well as corporate systems being key hacking targets,
alongside continuing growth of social networking scams.
2. Lottery and sweepstakes. No change here either. Seniors, often the most difficult to educate about
this crime, are the prime target.
3. Malware. We think this crime will grow in 2014, moving up a place in our chart because of the
increased use of smartphones and tablets. Security specialists suggest that half of all Android mobile
devices have no security installed. This is such a threat it could even dislodge lotteries from the
Number 2 slot.
4. Bogus Internet sites and fraudulent online sales.
5. Hit-and-run scams. This category moves up a slot too because of the sudden surge seen towards
the end of 2013 in bogus IRS and utility company payment demands. Also, as more people wise up to
the risks of wiring cash, crooks have switched to demanding their money on prepaid debit cards, giving
themselves some extra cash-gathering time before awareness of this new trick spreads. This category
can be affected by any major natural disaster, which drives up charity scams.
6. Grandparent/imposter scams. It's the simplicity of this one that makes it such a big earner for the
crooks. Although phone calls remain a popular technique, crooks are switching to spamming millions of
people using email address lists harvested from circulating messages, like jokes and pass-it-on

requests.
IRE 2014 - CONSUMER STORIES – page twenty
7. Expect to see a surge in reverse mortgage scams when older homeowners try to unlock some of the
equity in their property as prices start to recover.
The trend towards self-employment, a big feature of the past few years, could spark a new round of
work-from-home scams.
8. Advance fee scams. Scammers never seem to run out of ideas for new ways of fooling people into
sending them "overpayment" refunds or paying upfront for dubious services.
9. Investment scams. There seems to be little prospect of better interest rates for savers either, so
they'll continue to hunt for higher returns -- especially in precious metals and currency speculation.
We also anticipate a surge in crowdfunding investment scams as crowdfunding becomes a more
popular way to raise money for small businesses, causes and creative projects, especially with recent
changes in equity crowdfunding laws.
Towards the end of 2013, we noted a new surge in "pump-and-dump" schemes, in which victims are
fooled or pressured into buying worthless stock, pushing up prices and enabling the scammers to sell
their holdings before the price falls again.
10. Dating and sweetheart scams. This is a contender for moving up a place in the charts but we'll keep
it here for now.
