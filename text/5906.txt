Transparency in investigative reporting
Adding transparency to published material
●

Consider linking to documents within your story. While you can certainly direct readers to
live links, such as government reports, you may want to consider uploading a document
to ​Document Cloud​ and using that link. Outside links sometimes disappear, whereas
your Document Cloud links won’t.
Consider publishing your data online. This can take the form of a ​news app​ or even a
step as simple as allowing your readers/viewers/listeners to ​download an Excel or CSV
file. Unless the data includes personal information, I’d err on the side of making it public.
When undertaking a sophisticated data analysis, don’t just say “a data analysis found.”
Share​ how you did the analysis​. Be detailed and precise. Provide enough information so
others can replicate the analysis.
Provide clear ways for your audience to contact you with questions or tips. This can take
the form of a personal email address, a project email address or even a phone number
dedicated to the project (These are easy to set up using Google Voice.)

Being transparent about newsgathering and standards

If you are unable to get someone to comment, make it clear how hard you tried. You did
not just call them once on deadline; tell readers that.
Reveal not only what you know in a story, but what you don’t know. (“The impact was not
immediately clear, but …..”)
Use what TV calls “process storytelling” to explain to readers how you dug out key facts,
proved the case, chased the documents, followed the money. It’s not about bragging; it’s
about letting readers know what work you did.
If you consult with experts on your analysis, tell readers that you did and include the
credentials of the experts.
If a story subject will only answer written questions, make it clear that you requested an
interview. If a subject or agency gives you a statement that is unresponsive to the
questions, make that clear too. If the statement is lengthy and you need to edit it for the
story, link to the full statement if possible.
Consider publishing your standards -- in an ethics policy online, in columns to readers,
within stories as appropriate.

Being transparent about funding and support

If you are a nonprofit, publish a list of your funders.
If a story subject donates, disclose it in the story or in an editor’s note.
Whether you are a for-profit or nonprofit, consider a periodic ​report to stakeholders​,
outlining your mission and how you achieved it.

Being transparent about mistakes

Be honest about your errors. Encourage, rather than discourage, corrections.
For larger corrections, make them prominent. Sometimes write stories about them, if
warranted.
Publish a page with all your corrections on them.
If someone says you made an error, but you disagree, publish the complaint and your
response.
If you update an online story to correct a fact, let readers know that the story has been
updated.
Some papers have a policy -- “We don’t repeat the error” -- that causes corrections to be
very confusing. Keep revising the correction until you are sure the reader will understand
what was wrong.

Being transparent with story subjects

Interview subjects as soon as you can in the reporting process, and plan on followup
interviews. Waiting until very late in the process can lead to preconceived notions that
can harm your credibility and accuracy.
Avoid surprises whenever you can. Tell those in your stories what your conclusions are.
If they are going to challenge your conclusions, it’s much better to know before
publication.
As publication approaches, consider reviewing the story with some subjects, reading
back quotes when appropriate and summarizing context.
Consider a story walk-through even with those who declined to be interviewed. “I know
you don’t want to comment, but I would like to let you know what the story is going to say
about you so you can point me to evidence if you believe anything I have is inaccurate.”
The central premise of the story often becomes clearer during editing. If needed, go back
for comment on the central premise.
Even unnamed characters can feel ambushed if you don’t interview them. They and
others who know them are likely to recognize them. (“I was raped by an uncle when I
was a teenager. That’s why I became a prosecutor. “)
