Looking forward: SICs vs. NAICs
• 2000 data is last year for which SICs used
• NAICs used for 2001 data
• NAIC-based data not directly comparable to SIC-based
data
• New: Information = units that turn information into a
commodity + units that distribute the commodity + units
that provide information services
• Old: Some of manufacturing, communications, business
services, and amusement services
