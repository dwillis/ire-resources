Find this tipsheet at: ​http://bit.ly/nicar2019-multilingual-ddj

It's about the people
the team
● make sure your team is interdisciplinary, or single people can wear multiple hats
● if you collaborate with other reporters outside of your team, make sure they don't
have the wrong impression of what is expected from them
● embed designers and developers in regional teams
● make sure your team is diverse and understands the language of the region you are
covering, so they can do the legwork on location
● make an effort to bridge the gap between editorial and technical folks
the audience
● know the UX/UI preferences of your target group - and see whether you can live up to
them
● human stories are universal
● allow users to switch between language versions of the same content

who follow a plan –
Traffic
● if you want to cover a news event, make sure you are ready in time to ride the news
traffic wave to generate a one-off-wonder
● if you don't want to relate to a news peg, create the story in a way that it has a long
shelf life so it can become a long-tail tortoise
Reusability
● create technological templates that can be reused in different regional contexts (e.g.
election templates)
● create story templates, where your team provides the core with
findings/visuals/experts and regional desks only have to fill in with protagonists to
make data stories more manageable for smaller teams
● find datasets that are detailed enough to cover different regions, so you
clean/analyze data once and then can create several regionalized stories out of it
Sustainability
● if there is no data, it doesn't mean you can't make a story: either you make your own
data or you make a story about the lack of data
● if you build scrapers, have them run regularly/automatically so you can create
follow-up stories more easily
● create a database of databases you have been researching, including persons of
contacts inside your own organization and notes what to watch out for

but it is not that simple.

when creating maps​: beware of politically disputed areas (e.g. Western
Sahara/Morocco, Somalia/Somaliland, South Sudan, Golan Heights, Crimea,
Kashmir) and areas on the edges (New Zealand, Falkland Islands, Northern Russian
islands)
left-to-right or right-to-left​: for languages that run from right to left (rtl) instead of
left to right, consider whether your visual needs vertical mirroring
typography​: when fonts are being central part of your project's design, beware that
some fonts don't work in all languages
accessibility matters​: offer design solutions for slow connections/basic devices that
are actual alternatives to fancy javascript built features and go beyond "please
update your browser"
javascript conundrum​: by using it you leave out certain user groups on the one hand,
but on the other hand by not using it you miss out on innovation potential. You can
test certain browser features using ​https://caniuse.com​ and compare that with your
user’s browsers on Google analytics.
