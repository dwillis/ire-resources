Processing Text
How do we go from a blob of text to
something we can actually work with?
What can we count?

What tools can we use?

Text Processing Pipeline
Initial Text
We are fifteen years into this new century.

Lowercase
we are fifteen years into this new century.

Tokenize
we | are | fifteen | years | into | this | new | century | .
Stem
we | are | fifteen | year | into | thi | new | centuri | .
Stop Word Removal
we | are | fifteen | year | into | new | centuri

Pipeline Pointers
Lowercasing
Usually it’s ok, but sometimes capitals matter, e.g. in
peoples titles

Tokenization
If tokenizing sentences, you need to be careful for things
like
“Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President”

Stemming
Is language specific
May need reverse-stemming to be presentable back to the
user

Counting Stuff
Unigrams
Bigrams
N-Grams

Collocations
Regular
Expressions
“keyness”

Classes
AntConc

Linguistic Resources
Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count
Dictionaries for: affective words (pos emotions, neg
emotions); perceptual processes (see, hear, feel);
biological processes (health, sex); work; leisure; death;
religion; family & friends

General Inquirer
Dictionaries for: pleasure; pain, arousal; virtue; vice;
economics; legal; military; political, etc etc etc
BUT, dictionaries aren’t adapted to domain, to slang or
informal language etc.

Advanced Analysis
Part of Speech Tagging
Count interesting things like
superlatives, comparatives,
prepositions, pronouns
Use of word, e.g. “combat” N or
V?

Advanced Analysis
Named Entity Extraction
Identify people, places, organizations as such
Tough b/c of ambiguity in text, “Athens” GA or Greece?
New names always coming into existence so dictionary
lookup doesn’t extend well

Alchemy API

Putting it Together
Let’s Look at Sage Math Cloud & Some
Python:
