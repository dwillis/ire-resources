Managing and Juggling:
Working with editors to get time for
enterprise
Pick your project wisely
• Look for stories, not topics. Start with a small focus, then ask whether it’s an
example of something larger.
• Check your newspaper’s clips. Has the story been done before by your
organization? Check Nexis/IRE/Web: Has the story (or some version of it)
been done elsewhere? What can you learn from what’s already been done?
• Examine your idea critically on a variety of fronts: importance, freshness,
relevance, helpfulness. How does it fit with your organization’s coverage
goals? Is this the right time to do this story?
• Consult with your editor after you’ve done some basic reporting/clip searches
to gauge interest.
Don’t talk about it – Do it
• If there’s some interest by your editor, plunge in.
• Stay focused.
Develop a plan and gather string
• Identify and prioritize the initial reporting. Get FOIAs out early.
• Evaluate as you go. Be ruthless. Cut your losses early.
Manage your beat & feed the beast
• While you gather string, stay on top of your beat.
• Buy time and goodwill for when you really need it.
Make the pitch
• Write a one-page story proposal. Start with a newsy lede explaining your
thesis and showcasing what reporting you have that backs it up. Say what the
minimum story is – and what it would take to achieve it. Then give the
maximum story and what it would take. Give time estimates and an idea for
how your beat might be covered (or what would go uncovered) to get the time
you need.
Consider a “rolling” project
• Great journalism can be done as a series of daily stories, which collected
together form a project.
