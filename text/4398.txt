How we turned a half-joke of
a NICAR lightning talk into a
sensor journalism project.

Lightning talks before they were cool.

Luggage sensor
•

Operating battery life of 24+ hours.

•

High resolution, high speed accelerometer
responsiveness for recording brief impacts and
movements.

•

The ability to sense movement in any direction.

•

A real time clock for time stamping every recorded
accelerometer reading.

•

An easy way for the traveller to take recorded data and
email it to us following a journey with the sensor.

Things we wrestled with
•

It was going to take weeks to create a prototype.

•

Estimate unit cost: $100 per unit.

•

Wouldn’t it be easier to take a cheap Android
phone and write some software?

•

Answer: It depends.

Depends on volume
A few devices? Android way cheaper. Custom devices
get cheaper as you add units.

But this was an
experiment.

5 units were built
•

Of the five, four were deployed. Two worked.
One was never turned on. One produced no
useable data.

•

Of the two that worked, they travelled 25,000
miles and logged 597,363 observations.

•

1 flight: Lincoln to Minneapolis to Paris to
Nairobi. 26 hours, 135,061 observations.

The results
•

The hardest knock the luggage took was a 4.7 G
(46.06 m/s2) on the X axis at the original
enplanement in Lincoln. That's 12 standard
deviations from the mean of filtered output on X
axis, and more than four times standard gravity.
Compared to the test drops, that's greater than
the force of a four-foot drop.

The results

•

So is this buzz or BS?

•

Yes.
