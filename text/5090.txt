What

Why

How

Google Fusion Tables is Googles answer to database-tables in the To find tables, others have
cloud. You can upload tables to Fusion and merge them with other decided to make public, go here:
table-data. You can visualize data and embed the result on a
website.
http://research.google.com/tables
Google Fusion tables are placed under Google Docs/Google Drive.
Select Fusion Tables (left)
Go to: http://drive.google.com.
Or click on the nine small quadrates in the upper right:

Who can
use
Google
Fusion?

You must have a Google-account. Ordinary Google Fusion maps
are free to use. You can’t place the map behind a paywall. If you
build advanced maps (with use of API) you will have to pay, if you
have more than 25.000 pageviews in 90 consecutive days. If
you’re below that, it’s free too.

Upload a
table

You can upload from Google Spreadsheet or directly from your
own computer. You can upload tables from a number of different
file formats (including excel and csv) (max 100 MB).
Make the analysis of data before uploading, so you’re sure of
what you want to display in Google Fusion.
Before you create the first fusion table, you must once and for all
add the necessary app. Can’t you choose the green icon with the
zigzag after clicking Create (look right), then choose “Connect
more apps”. Search for Fusion and connect the app to Google
Drive. Now you can create google fusion tables.

Edit
columns

Normally it’s necessary to modify columns to be sure Google
Fusion uses them in the right way. The data type in columns can
be text, numbers, dates, locations. Location is the format for
geocoding in Google Fusion, meaning this is what Google use to
display dots or areas on a map.
This is very important to check.

Choose
right
format

Google can easily read an address as a location. But it’s important
that the address is in one single cell:

Do this in your spreadsheet before the import to Google Fusion.

If you already have latitude and longitude in the data, you can
have them in 2 columns or write them in one field with a comma
in between:

This is a result of the geocoding

Share
table

To make public visualizations visible you need to publish and
share. Choose Tools and Publish and fill it out.
Then choose share, check and decide the level of visibility. If you
want to make a map to send or embed on a web site you need to
make it accessible.

Make
View

The uploaded table is the basic. If you only want to give others
access to part of the table, you can do it under File and Create
View.
(If you find a public table, you can create a view of this table and
make your own visualizations.)

Or you can use “Make a Copy” – only available in “New look”

If you want to create a view - remove the acceptance for the
fields, you don’t want to share, and then hide the view under a
new name. You can choose to share this new view and not the
original table as described above.

overview

Under ”File” you can choose ”Download” – from here you can
download the data of the table and save them as a csv-file.
If you find a public table on the web, you may be able to
download the data as well.
When you upload tables you will be able to see the headlines in
fusion and in Google Drive. You will also be able to see other info
on the content.

You can move or delete a table, but you have to “tick” it first.
When you tick a table a new toolbar, appears at the top.
Be sure to name tables so it is easy by the name to identify the
content. Be sure to organize your drive, so projects are saved in a
folder for each project.

What
Show data
on a map

Why

How

An
example

Often data has a geographic angle, which we first can see clearly when
Check other memos on
data is put on a map.
Google Fusion too
Data can be visualized on a map as icon markers if data contain
addresses or coordinates. And the data type of the specific field in the
fusion table has to be “location”.
In this example our table with municipalities contains a name, a location (latitude and longitude) and
one single value, the population in 2010. We want to create a map with this information.

Share

We share the visualization. We’ll make it visible if you know the link.

Choose
map

We want to visualize the data as a map. Click on the “Map” tab.

Study the
result

The map should show up now.

The info
window

The content of the info window will default be the text from all fields in
the dataset. In this case:

We want to change the info window. We don’t need coordinates, and
we may want a journalistic text, which explains that the number is a
population. It’s easy to fix.

Click first ”Share” in the
upper right corner.

In the “Tools” menu you’ll
find links to different
tools, you can use, when
you want to change the
appearance. To change
the content of the info
window, press ”Change
info window layout”
1

Kaas & Mulvad | 30-09-2013 | Internet | Google | Create maps from data in Google Fusion Tables
MEMO
Configure
info
window

”Automatic” is the default showing of all content. If you want to decide what should be visible,
choose ”Custom”. We’ll do that now:

You can write your own text, and you can use information from the dataset. For example if you want
to insert the name of the municipality, just write {Name} – the name of the field. And if you want to
insert the population, just write {2010} – the header row of the population field. The curly braces are
necessary if fusion is to understand that we refer to fields from the dataset.
In the column at the left we are reminded of the names of the header rows – it’s easy to forget…
When you doubleclick on a name, it will jump into the box at the right.
I only write <br> when I want a new line. I write <b> and </b> to make the name of the
municipality bold.

When you are done, you’ll save and close this window. And you must now click on the map and
check if everything is satisfactory.

Size

In this case it looks fine. The text appears on two lines, because I inserted
the code for linebreaks <br>. Else all text would have appeared on one
single, long line.
The info window has a fixed size, but it’s possible to write a code that will
change the size of the window. For example:
<div class="googft-info-window"; style="width:350px; height:100px;
overflow:auto">
</div>
The lines has to be the first and the last line in the box. Change the numbers
and you’ll change the size of the info window (in pixel)

MEMO
Design

Insert
pictures
Insert links

Use common html code to change the design. For example:
<b>This text will be bold</b> bold
<i>This text will be italic</i> italic
This code will fetch and in the info window display a picture file:
<img src="http://www.kaasogmulvad.dk/picture.jpg">
You can choose to replace parts of this address with a reference {} to a field
in the table where the name of the picture may be placed.
To insert link in the info window:
<a href=”http://www.kaasogmulvad.dk”>Click this text</a>
A blue link will appear: Click this text – which will lead to the site.
Or we can in the construction of the link write a reference to a field in the
table.
This is useful if you for example have a company ID as one of the fields, and
you want to create a link in the info window which makes a live query in a
database (or perhaps even a query in Google).

Change
icons

Default we get red circles on the map. But we can change this.
Under ”Change map styles” – find it under “Tools” – it’s possible to change
all icons to another type. Or we can let the colors reflect a value in the
dataset.
It’s also possible to write the name of the icon the specific address should
appear as. We have a list of icons to choose from.
http://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?snapid=99003
(Click on the icon to read it’s name. This name should be written in the
dataset).
If we use this solution, we must choose ”Column” under ”Configure styles”
and tell Fusion, which column contains the name of the icons.

MEMO
Embed

You can choose to distribute the map link to others, but maybe you want to
show the map as a part of another site. In that case you need the
embeddable link.
Click “Publish” (find it under “Tools”):

The first link gives you a full screen version of the map – and no access to
the table data. The second link is the embed code, you for example can
paste into a CMS system, or when you write a blog entry etc.
The two first numbers controls the size of the map on your blog page.
Remember, that your own page or cms can give some limitation and you
must change and adjust the code until the layout and design is satisfactory.

Even after you have
copied the embed
code, you can change
details – for example
the centre of the map
(the lat,long) and the
zoom level (the
number after ”z=”)

MEMO

Hvad

Hvorfor

Hvordan

Understand
polygons

Unlike points, a polygon is an area on a map - typically a postal
district, a municipality, region or even a country. Different types of
map applications define polygons in different ways. In Google Fusion
a polygon is built up as a KML file.
The KML file is a file made up of a large number of points - each
defined by a longitude and latitude. The points are in fact a very long
row, which together form the outline of the polygon. There may be
several separate polygons that are grouped together into a single
polygon - for example, a municipality that has one or more islands.
Therefore do not be surprised that a table with municipal polygons
may have more rows than the total number of municipalities.
You can be lucky that someone already has imported the required
polygons to Google Fusion and made the result public. You can try
searching for the polygons in the search box. Remember to select
“Fusion Tables” at the left of the screen.

In the Fusion-table you’ll
find the polygon in one
single field. It will typically
look like this:

You can find the polygons on the web. National authorities may or
may not have created polygons for regions, municipalities, postcodes
etc. Very often they will appear as "shape files".
Shapefile is a vector data format developed by the company ESRI.
If an authority uses the map application ArcView, they work with
shapefiles. These are easy to convert to KML and Google Fusion.
Just ask authorities whether they will share their shape files with
you.
There are several places you can convert shapefiles to KML - a site
which is easy to use is http://shpescape.com
You make sure that your shape file (which is actually a folder with
several files) is located in a folder that is zipped. Upload it at
shpescape.com. You give the site permission to access your Google
Fusion account. And the converted file will appear in your list of
Google documents, when it is ready.
Be aware that it may take some time. Sometimes there is a queue,
and if it is a very big shapefile you work with, it can also take some
time to get it converted.
Do you work with maps of foreign countries; this site is a good source
for free shapefiles. For each country you’ll typically find two to four
different administrative boundaries.(Counties, municipalities etc)
When the shape file is imported, shpescape.com will show a link you
can click and you are automatically transported to your own list of
Google documents, where a table with all data from the polygons
now can be found.

Polygon files can be visualized itself as a map, but it’s not that
interesting until you combine the map with values. One of the fields
in the polygon table typically contains a code – it could be an ID of
the county, municipality etc.
The dataset you want to visualize must contain the same ID so you
can merge the two datasets.

In the window at the left hand side, you will see the fields of the
table you have open at the moment. At the right you can see the
fields of the polygon table you want to merge into the data table.
It’s important that you choose, which field the two tables have in
common. In this example (Danish municipalities) the common field is
an ID. The ID will be the “zipper” which will merge the two tables
securely together.

When the merger is done,
you will be presented with
a link to the new dataset.

What

Why
Google maps with points are easy to create. Maps with polygons are
only a bit more difficult. The hardest part can be to find files with
polygons, but even that is possible.
The site, we will use today is diva-gis.org. It’s a great site for
downloading free spatial data.

How

http://www.divagis.org/gdata

This memo will go through the process of converting shape files to
KML, which is useable in Google Fusion Tables.
From diva-gis.org you can download files with administrative
boundaries for a large number of countries. In this example we will
create a map with the regions in Norway. First thing is to download a
file with the Norwegian data:

On the display on the screen it looks like we will get more than one
administrative level:

Anyway – we click on Download and receive a zipped folder:
NOR_adm.zip
When we look into the folder, we can see that we have received
three different administrative levels. NOR_adm0 is the country. Next
level is NOR_adm1 and the most local level – the smallest
administrative units – is contained in NOR_adm2. The file format is
shape files.

1

11

Kaas & Mulvad | 1.10.13 | Internet | Google | Find and convert polygon data for use in Google Fusion Tables
MEMO
This is the content of the zipped folder:

We have data for each region (fylke in Norwegian) and we want to
map those data. So we have to copy all files with NOR_adm1 in the
title to a new folder N_regions, and we will zip that folder to
N_regions.zip

Copy all files which name
includes (in this case)
NOR_adm1

To create a Google Fusion map based on the Norwegian regions, we
must upload the data to Google Fusion. And we will do that through
this site: www.shpescape.com It might be slow (or even down) but
it works fine most of the time. You just need patience.
The service will convert the shape files to the format Google wants,
KML. Go to the site in a browser. Choose: “shp2fusion tables”.
You will be told, that you need to authorize the site to access your
Fusion Tables data on your behalf. Only if you do so, the service can
connect to your Google account and upload the files.
You don’t have to use the advanced options. You can leave those
unchecked.
You will be prompted to upload a file. I’m going to upload the zipped
folder I created a minute ago.
The site might be busy and you might end up in a queue. But be
patient. Eventually it’ll be uploaded. You can leave the page without
problems.

Paste the files into an
empty folder. Close it and
zip it.

When you visualize the
polygon table in fusion,
you’ll see the regions:

When this appears,

click on the link, and you will see your polygon table in Google Fusion

What

Why

More
possibilities

You may choose to color polygons in different ways. The color of the
range may reflect a property /quality - for example the areas where red
block or blue block won. Or values above / below a country's average.
The color might also reflect the value of an underlying data set - the
more bankruptcies, the darker colors.

First: Choose
journalistic
angle
Know your data

The most important thing is to have a journalistic angle. Then look at the
possibilities on mapping afterwards.

Visualize
data

You need to be in the map view. Click "Change map". Then click "Change
feature styles" to the left of the map and get started. A dialog box opens:

How

Before the visualization you should also know your data. Which column
must decide the color. What is the highest / lowest value in the column?
Are almost all values clustered within a narrow range. Or are they
spread? This could have some impact on how intervals are set.

Be sure to click under "Polygons" – else nothing happens.
If you want to color the map, then start with "Fill color".
There are now four options:

Choose method

"Fixed" allows only one color.
"Column" can be used if a column of data for each record has written a
color code for the color of the polygon. Color codes should be written like
this: # FF0000 (which gives a red color).
"Buckets" allows for you to decide intervals (remember to set the lowest
and highest value), and the colors can be completely different.
"Gradient" provides a sliding scale - from light to dark - in 8 colors.
Again, remember to write values into the boxes - lowest and highest.
In both cases, the highest value being slightly higher than the highest
value in the data set. Otherwise, the top value is not on the map.
Under "Buckets" you can also easily make a sliding color scale - and it is
only under "Buckets" that you can decide where the interface between
the scale are set. This can be important if you want to create a detailed
legend for his card.

There are many lists
of "hexadecimal color
codes" for example,
this:
http://www.decembe
r.com/html/spec/colo
rsafe.html
Colorbrewer
(http://colorbrewer2.

color codes for scales
(which is ensured to
be viewed and
understood by
colorblinds).
Colorbrewer will

write a color code
such: 0x2CA25F
Fusion write it like
this: #2CA25F
Legends

If you want a legend, choose "Automatic legend" under you see "Change
map styles".
There are not many options, but you can select the title in the legend
and also which corner of the map the legend should be placed. Finally,
whether there should be a link at the bottom of the legend to the actual
data table.
A typical legend can look like this:

The "automatic" legend is a great achievement, but if you want to work
more with it - and, for example, change the English language "to"
another language, then you have to "hack" the script.

MEMO

What

Why

Maps can be
combined

If we want to show geographically information in context, we must be
able to combine several different maps in one. It may be several maps
with points - or maps with points and maps with polygons to be
combined. We can also include search boxes next to the map. And
finally, we can change the look of the map, Geographical names can be
removed.

How
http://bit.ly/Jsxsoz

For this we use a free service: Fusion TablesLayer Builder
According to Googles rules for styled maps - and it is this type, we
create with TablesLayer Builder - it can cost money.
However, this requires that you have 25,000 map views every day for 90
days in a row.
Maps produced exclusively in the standard interface (Google Docs /
Drive), remains free. Read more here:
http://googlegeodevelopers.blogspot.dk/2012/06/lower-pricing-andsimplified-limits.html
Example

This map is built up in the Fusion TablesLayer builder. Here are a
combined map of points and polygons:

Limits

You can load multiple maps together in one layer using this wizard.
The information windows that appear when you click on a point or
polygon, will be those prepared in the respective maps. The design of
each map must therefore be completed in Google Fusion.

Oppor-tunities

You can then divide the different information types into several maps,
giving you the ability to have different information windows. You can
then mix points and polygons, and have more than one map on
polygons in the final map.

Prepare

You must have your maps ready. You can still work with them later.

Choose order

The order means something. If you combine a polygon map with a
points map, start with the polygons. If you do it opposite, the polygons
will make the points invisible or hard to see the colors.

The first layer

In "Embed link" in the layer builder you can insert the written code for
the first map. The code can be found by opening the map, select
"Publish" under "Tools" - and then copying the top link. It normally
would give a full screen display of your map.

For example, the PC program Notepad (included with windows) is ideal.
If you use Mac and use TextEdit – be sure in the menu to go to
“Format” and choose “Convert to ordinary format” (or something
similar).
If you don’t have Notepad or TextEdit on your computer, you can
download and install the simple and free program TextWrangler. There

The code is inserted into a new blank document in Notepad. Then save the document - and name
it with the .htm or .html suffix. And make sure that the program does not overwrite transmission
with eg .txt or similar. Below I have changed from the default File type = .txt to "All Files" - that
means that my naming .html is respected and not overwritten.

When the document is stored on your PC, it can be opened in a standard browser on your own
computer. If you want others to see your document, it need to be stored on a web server,
uploaded to a CMS like WordPress or just be in the "public folder" if you use DropBox. Right click
then on the map in the "public folder" and you can copy the file's address on the web.
Remember, you can always open the map file in a text editor if you want to edit it.
Embed the
map

If you want to embed the map, you must do it in two steps - first make
the map and get it online at one of the above mentioned methods. And
then you must make an iframe on your site and display the map in it.
