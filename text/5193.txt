Journalists, Sources, and Policy Outcomes: Insights from IRE Contest Entries
Gerry Lanosga glanosga@indiana.edu & Jason Martin jmart181@depaul.edu
Why study contest narratives to understand journalist/source relations?
Normative expectation: investigative journalists are watchdog on democratic governance.
Therefore, explanations of how stories begin, how they relate to key sources, and what qualities
make substantive outcomes more likely are key to understanding and promoting the profession.
Previous studies relied on analysis of published stories, which misses key aspects of reporting
process (tips, dead-ends, background sources, history with sources). How do journalists and
sources work together to build the news agenda? Most agenda building studies focus on PR
info subsidies & few link building of media agenda to policy implications.
Results from random sample of 1,455 entries distributed from 1979-2012
Newspapers about half of investigations, but decrease over time (70% to 42%, 70s-10s)
Digital media, joint projects, student “pro-am” partnerships on rise. Median time spent
investigating: 18 weeks.
Subjects: Government/campaigns 47.7%; private sector 29.7%; non-profit, education, social
problems, govt/business partnerships 3-7%. TV more likely to investigate private sector,
newspapers more likely to investigate government.
Story trigger: Enterprise (47%); source tip (35%); assigned (8%); undet./other 10%. Enterprise
increased from 22% in 70s to 51% of investigations in 2010s.
Digital news outlets: ⅔ of projects are enterprise.
Source tip type: Citizen (22%), Govt. (21%); Business (12.5%); Advocacy (7%); Expert (3%) …
Undetermined/other 34%
Sources: Govt 79%; citizen 60%; business 40%; expert 39%; advocate & attorney 25%. Nonhuman sources: Documents 91%; FOIA requests 42%; data 33%
Measurable results: Overall 70% of entries. Official investigation (28%);
Arrest/firing/resignation (16%); Industry action (13%). “Other govt action” legislative,
administrative, judicial (45%); policymaker pledge (17%). Entrants forthcoming about failure to
produce tangible results. TV most likely to get results. Explicit mention of public records laws
more likely to get results.
Binary logistic regression: Story tips 1.7 times more likely to produce results, but growth of
enterprise, FOI, data shows development of investigative reporting
