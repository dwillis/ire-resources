Want to log into websites safely?
First, stop using the same password across multiple websites. It seems we see a new, massive
dump of passwords every week. When a website gets hacked, hackers use the passwords from
one website on other sites to see if they can get into users’ accounts. This is why it’s important
not to reuse passwords. Simultaneously, we reuse passwords because they’re difficult to rem.
Password managers can help us solve this problem. Two-factor authentication adds another
layer of security, requiring access to device before anyone can log into your account.
Use two-factor authentication (2FA)
Two-factor authentication refers to generating a temporary, second “password” (a second
factor) before logging in. This password is typically sent through an SMS text message or a
mobile app.
You should add two-factor authentication everywhere, but in particular, your email. If your email
is compromised, your other accounts can be easily stolen as well. If a hacker steals your
password and you have 2FA installed, they are most likely locked out of your account.
First, go here: ​http://twofactorauth.org/
Look into services that you want to secure with two-factor authentication. You can add 2FA with
SMS text messages, or an app. SMS messages can be easily intercepted by third parties, so a
2FA app is generally safer.
● Google Authenticator.​ Download for iPhone
(​https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8​) or Android
(​https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2​)
● Authy. Download for iPhone (​https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/authy/id494168017?mt=8​)
or Android (​https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en​)
Some services will allow you to use a physical device for 2FA, such as a Yubikey. These are
generally the safest (and easiest) option.

Use password managers
With password managers, you only need to remember one password in order to access your
password vault, which stores your other long, randomly-generated passwords. Password
managers can also help automatically fill passwords in your browser, which will save you time.
●
Consider 1Password: ​https://1password.com/​ ($36.00 annually or $65 one time).
●
Consider LastPass: ​https://lastpass.com​ (free on one computer and mobile devices)
●
For a free and open source option, consider KeePassXC: ​https://keepassxc.org/

Note: If you want your passwords offline-only, KeePassXC is the most reliable option.
If a hacker manages to get your password on one account, but you’ve randomized and stored
each unique password with a password manager, you can isolate a breach while still getting
easy access to all of your accounts.

Want to protect your personal data? Use disk encryption
If you lose, or if someone takes your unsecured device, it’s easy to access your files or copy
your disk drive and read the files. Luckily, it’s also pretty easy to encrypt devices so that no
one can read them except us.
● If you own a newer iPhone and have a passcode, there’s a good chance your phone is
already encrypted. Read more: ​https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202064
● Not all Android devices are disk encrypted by default. Learn how to encrypt your
Android device: ​https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/2844831
● If you use Mac OS X, you can encrypt your drive using FileVault:
https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837
● If you use Windows, some versions allow you to encrypt your drive with BitLocker:
http://www.pcworld.com/article/2308725/encryption/a-beginners-guide-to-bitlocker-wi
ndows-built-in-encryption-tool.html
● For most Linux distributions, users must set up disk encryption when installing their OS.

Need to do research anonymously?
Use Tor Browser!
Download: ​https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en
● Allows users to browse the Web while leaving a misleading metadata trail.
○ Normally your IP address will connect directly to a website, and the connection
may or may not be encrypted. Tor browser routes your connection through three
servers around the world before connecting you to the destination website, so
you will appear to connect from a remote location.
○ You should avoid putting personally identifying information into Tor Browser.
○ If you are trying to connect in a region that blocks Tor traffic, launch the
browser, and click ‘Open Settings’ -> ‘Configure’ -> ‘Yes’ -> ‘obfs4’ ->
‘Continue’ -> ‘No’. This will allow you to disguise your traffic and bypass the
block.
If your connection to the website was encrypted going in (e.g., with an HTTPS connection) it’s
encrypted when it leaves the Tor network too. If it’s unencrypted in (HTTP) going into the
network, it’s also unencrypted leaving the network.
Why Tor, and not a VPN (virtual private network)?

When you use a VPN, your provider can see your real IP address and your internet traffic at the
exit point. In contrast, Tor Browser masks your internet traffic from everyone.
Encrypt your files over the cloud
Google Drive and Dropbox are easy to use options for backing up data remotely, but these
services can be decrypted by the company. For your most sensitive data, consider
“zero-knowledge” services that encrypt your data so the service provider can’t read it.
● For sync cloud data on convenient mobile and desktop applications, consider
SpiderOak (​http://spideroak.com​) or Tresorit (​http://tresorit.com​). Each service offers a
range of payment plans for your personal or organization’s needs.
● Cryptomator (​https://cryptomator.org/​) can help you encrypt files on other cloud
services (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox). Cryptomator has a “pay what you want” model.

Want to talk to colleagues and sources securely?
Need mobile text messaging, video and voice calls? Use Signal!
Download: ​https://signal.org​ and click the link to Apple or Android store.
● Signal is end-to-end encrypted, meaning that only the conversational participants can
read your data. Not even the service provider can read it. It’s a good replacement for
text messages and phone calls with other Signal users.
● Signal uses your phone number and contact list from your phone to find other users.
● With most messengers, there’s no way to know that your message isn’t being
intercepted or tampered with. On Signal, you can verify your conversation is secure
using “safety numbers.” Check that the safety numbers on your device, and your
conversational partner’s device both match. There will almost certainly be a match, but
if there’s not, something is wrong with the encryption.

Shelton (@mshelton): ​https://freedom.press/news/signal-beginners/
Want to talk securely over desktop, or concerned about metadata? Use Ricochet!
Download: ​https://ricochet.im/
● Assigns a unique, random chat ID per install (e.g. “ricochet:vlsh4iw4n5ga5des”)
○ If you have ricochet on two computers, ​you’ll have two different chat IDs.
○ Give someone your ricochet:id and they can add you.
○ You can give IDs local nicknames so you know whose it is.
● Uses Tor to provide a misleading IP location, so network attackers would have a tough
time identifying where a user is located. (You don’t have to install Tor separately.)

Important terms
●
●

Content: What people are talking about in the conversation.
Metadata: Information about the conversation (who’s talking, when, for how long).
Conversational tools must create metadata in order to deliver messages.

●
●
●
●

●

●

“Cleartext” or “plaintext”: An unencrypted, human-readable message.
Encrypt: Scramble a message so it can't be read.
Decrypt: Reverse the encryption process to make an encrypted message readable.
"End-to-end" encryption: Most conversations web services (e.g., Twitter DMs) are
designed to allow the service to unscramble the message. An end-to-end encrypted
conversation means that the encryption is designed so that no one except the intended
conversational participants can unscramble the message.
Verification (sometimes referred to as "authenticating"): Ensuring that the person you’re
speaking with is the person you think they are. More about this process:
https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/help/authenticate.php
Logging: Saving chat conversations or metadata.
