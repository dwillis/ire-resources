When should I look for a government database?
Anytime you’re researching a story that needs data to support your lede. More and more
government agencies, including those in the smallest jurisdictions, store public
documents electronically.
Who do I call?
Start with the main news media contact -- unless you already know someone in the
agency’s technology department.
How quickly will I get what I need?
It could take minutes -- or weeks. It depends on the size of the database and the
willingness of the agency to comply with the spirit -- and not just the letter -- of openrecords laws.
The agency’s first response may be a series of “no’s.’’ As with any public-records
request, insist that agency officials put denials in writing. When pressed, many agencies
realize they can’t find a specific exemption under the law -- so they have to cough up the
information.
