Why police misconduct lawsuits?
●
●
●
●

To investigate police misconduct not only as a racial and social justice
issue but as a fiscal accountability issue.
Lawsuits create a data and document trail that is publicly available but not
easily accessible.
They often tell great stories
There are trends and patterns that can be discovered from police lawsuits
but Chicago isn’t looking for them (ignoring best practices and, now, the
DOJ).

Problem: officer matching
DIRTY DATA

Solution: officer matching
Link each casecop record to a cop record--obtained from CPD through FOIA
(h/t to @matt_kiefer)
●

●
●

Automate the process, using
available information: first
name, last name, star numbers
Use logic to remove possible
false positives
If there’s only one possible
match, call it a success

Analysis
Look for patterns in:
●
●
●

Officers
Types of complaints
Location

Follow the money:
●
●
●

How much is the city spending overall?
Where does the money come from?
What else could it be spent on?

Compare to civilian complaints

What we learned
●

A tiny cohort of officers are defendants in multiple lawsuits:
○

●

There are patterns that point to systemic problems
○
○
○

●
●

2,396 officers were named in at least one lawsuit that settled from 2011-16. 56
officers—less than half of one percent of the force—were named in more than 3 lawsuits.
45 of those officers are still on the force.
Nearly half of the lawsuits claim that officers filed false reports—and sometimes
committed perjury on the witness stand—to cover up their misconduct.
Nearly one-third allege that some officers on the scene could have but didn’t intervene to
prevent misconduct.
In one-quarter of excessive force lawsuits, the person who alleged police abuse was also
charged with either resisting arrest or assault of a police officer.

Despite years of spending tens of millions of dollars, the city still doesn’t
budget enough, so they borrow to pay for these lawsuits
Even when the city admits liability in a lawsuit, officers are rarely
disciplined

What we learned
About creating a database of police misconduct lawsuits...
Things we did well:
●
●
●

Stories are powerful
Tags make it easy to explore the data
Make it shareable

Things we could have done better:
●
●
●

Figure out what’s important early to save time later
Talk to lawyers early
Talk to your audience early about how they might use it

What we learned
About creating a database of police misconduct lawsuits...
●
●

It’s time consuming
It’s expensive
