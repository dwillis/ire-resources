Places to find stories about people
affected by the opioid epidemic
From reporters and editors at The Palm Beach Post
FAMILIES - Families are frustrated and often want to speak out and talk to a reporter and share their
sad, grisly details in hopes of saving someone else. It’s now common (not so much a few years ago) for
obits to include drug addiction as cause of death.
MEDICAL EXAMINER - Coddle and get to know the ME and staff. They’re on the front lines and will likely
work with media on latest opioids they’re finding and their lack of adequate staff and how they get
pulled into the local politics by having to grovel to government agencies for more help (in Palm Beach
County, he grovels to the County Commission). Ask ME what he thinks the public needs to know and
what he thinks is the best approach public agencies should take.
EMS - Emotional toll on EMS crews responding to so many overdoses. We’ve heard anecdotes about
young EMS personnel rolling to the scene of an OD and they wind up finding the body of a high school
pal or someone they know.
FACEBOOK and INSTAGRAM - Check social media of families, especially people in recovery and those
who have died. There are wonderful stories in those posts.
COLLEGES – Kids having trouble getting into colleges because of crimes they committed while they were
using. Some universities are starting sober dorms.
LIBRARIES – Often a place to spend the day indoors, librarians are having to cope with overdoses.
HEALTH-CARE WORKERS – How they’re holding up with several overdoses a day. Plus babies
withdrawing in the NICU.
POLICE – A new deadly threat – getting a whiff of fentanyl.
SCHOOLS – Should they carry Narcan?
