Blogs and wikis have exploded as communication media. Why not put them to use in the
newsroom? Here’s a selection of blog and wiki software you can run inside your firewall.
A good list of blogging and wiki software can be found on Wikipedia:

Blogs
WordPress – http://wordpress.org/
One of the most popular blogging platforms available. Installation on an
Apache/PHP/MySQL server is simple, and takes just a few minutes. The interface is
simple, and can be mastered in a matter of minutes. Has the ability to create “pages” or
blog entries outside the typical chronology. Handy for creating pages you want to stay
around in a prominent place.
Moveable Type – http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/
Another widely used blogging platform. Another that installs quickly and easily on an
Apache/PHP/MySQL setup. The interface is slightly more complex, but not overly so.
Tends to run slower than WordPress, and requires the site to be rebuilt on every update.
When the site gets large, rebuilds can take a while.
Sharepoint – http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/sharepoint/
Sharepoint is really a total intranet platform that has blog like functions. For newsrooms
that have Microsoft obsessed IT managers, Sharepoint can work well. Installation and
configuration is difficult, especially if you already have an ASP/SQL Server environment
already set up. Sharepoint shines when structured data, such as contact lists, are involved.

Wikis
MediaWiki – http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki
MediaWiki is the open source project that is running Wikipedia. It requires PHP and
MySQL, but it will run on any web server. Installation is easy, but configuration can take
some work, depending on your customization needs and wants. Documentation is
extensive and easy to follow. Look and feel is a little complex, but not difficult to learn.
Instiki -- http://instiki.org/show/HomePage
Instiki represents the other extreme of wiki – stripped down, extremely simple, requires
very little in the way of setup. It runs on Ruby, a language that has it’s own web server
built into it. Install Ruby, install Instiki, start it, and you’re ready to go. Trouble is, Ruby
isn’t a very common install. Instiki has all the functions you’ll need, but not much else.
