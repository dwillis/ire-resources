Dodging Disasters

Liz Lucas IRE/NICAR

Overall concepts:
 Take the time to be careful while you’re executing your analysis; this will save you time later.
 Be aware of your assumptions about your data.
Before:
 Keep careful notes on your methodology; note your assumptions.
 Know your data – what’s not in it, how it’s collected, whether there are holes.
 If you are going to do a number of data transformations and calculations, run your methodology
by someone who has experience in the subject and/or the data.
During:
 If you’re adding, subtracting, taking rates, looking at trends, be sure the numbers MAKE SENSE.
Turn off the SQL/math side of your brain, and turn on your common sense. Do the final numbers
make sense?
 Don’t take two years of data to identify a trend – “Two years does not a trend make.”
 Don’t use absolute words like “every”, “all” … think more in terms of “about”, “approximately”,
“at least” or “as many as”. Data rarely give absolute numbers or results.
 Be aware of the dangers of joining tables!! You can duplicate results and get wrong numbers
very quickly. Remember this rule: only ONE of the tables you’re joining can have multiple
instances of the value(s) in the column(s) you are joining on.
 Where possible, talk to someone who might have inside information. See if the numbers strike
them as accurate.
After:
 Always have someone else look over your work, from start to finish.
 Be able to walk through all your SQL steps; if someone new to the project is looking over your
shoulder, s/he should be able to reproduce your work.
 What if you don’t have someone to look over your shoulder? Where possible, try to get your
numbers two different ways.
 If you have used a lot of functions in Excel, double-check all (or a representative sample) of
those functions, make sure they’re doing what you think they’re doing.
