INVESTIGATING THE CASUALTIES OF WAR - IRE 2009
First visit. First impressions are unbelievably important when approaching a source with
explosive information. Go to them physically with one agenda item – gaining trust. Hand over some
control over the story if necessary by agreeing not to print anything without running it by your
source first. Promise to keep in touch – and do it – as you report out the story so the source
becomes more invested in your work and starts to feel like he or she is actually participating in the
discoveries.
Thank you calls. After your visit, call and thank the source. Reiterate your understanding about
his concerns about the story, whatever they may be. Say you understand those concerns and will
work hard to address them. Tell him you appreciate the trust.
Shift to their hours. Try to figure out when your source is at his best. Can he talk at work? Is he
most relaxed in the evenings? Weekends? Set your schedule to his schedule.
Verification. A source may provide something that’s difficult to verify and/or place into the proper
context, such as a tape recording, photograph, or errant document. Gather as much information as
possible to verify what your source(s) tells you. Go back to your source, as needed, with new
questions that arise. Speak to others allegedly involved or implicated in the matter. Find out if
there’s been an official investigation and request the results of that investigation, including any
copies that would match/verify what you have obtained. Be willing to speak with sources off the
record in order to gain a broader understanding of your material. Continue attempts to contact
everyone directly involved--knock on doors, call phone numbers.
The "hostile" source. You may get just one chance to interview a source that's potentially hostile-a person who probably would rather not see your story printed. To prepare, write up a short list of
must-have questions beforehand. Try to memorize them and rehearse how you will ask your initial
question. (See tip below for the opening question.) Do the interview in person if possible. Record it
if practical and legal. Be polite and up-front about being a reporter before you ask your first
question. Answer any questions with honesty. Keep asking your questions, even if the person
starts to waver.
Opening and closing lines. Have a hook — an opening line that, like a good lede, makes the
person want to know more. Give him/her a headline that begs for explanation. Appeal to her/his
curiosity and self-interest. E.g.: “I found your name in this declassified file...” Carefully tailor your
question to the story and situation. Anticipate <10 seconds to convince the person. Have a backup
line ready—one you can deliver as the door’s swinging closed or in the momentary pause before
the hang-up. Warning: Don’t lie. It’ll backfire on you later. At the end of the interview, explain that
you’re continuing your research and offer to keep the person posted on what you find out. As noted
above, this will increase the likelihood otherwise reluctant subjects will talk to you again.
Try again. If at first you don’t succeed, try again – and again. People change their minds. Use all
channels of communication: phone, email, letter, overnight, doorstep, close associates. Especially
try one more time at deadline. Some subjects refuse to cooperate in the hope that you’ll be
deterred from doing the story. If you try one more time near deadline, they’ll realize the strategy
didn’t work, and you may get a deathbed confession.

Document strategies. If you’re onto a juicy story, chances are good that some department within
the military has already probed the matter. Ask for the results of any investigations or other
documents that pertain to what you are probing. Sometimes just in the course of your asking,
military officials will provide indications that let you know you are on the right track, such as
acknowledging the existence of a document by prompting you to make a formal request for it in
writing and then directing you to the gatekeeper of that information. If the military refuses you, use
the Freedom of Information Act. Though the military might refuse or delay your request—or redact
the results—your readers/viewers will appreciate your effort to get to the truth. Even the release of
a report with redacted results can force officials who weren’t previously talking to agree to an
interview.
Prepare for the push back. When it comes to investigations, it is not enough to simply report the
news, you must be prepared to defend your piece as well. The best defense is a good offense.
How will the subject of the investigation react? What will he say about you or your work when he
goes on CNN? How can you prepare the article to address those issues?
Consider multi-media. The web is particularly powerful for investigative journalists. Look at the
material you have gathered during the course of your investigation and consider publishing some
of that as well. (Take care not to overwhelm you readers with too much volume. Don’t just dump
stuff out there.) Also, consider the emotional impact of your piece. How will people feel? Is it
enough to address those issues in the writing or do you need a person on a video addressing
those issues to buttress your case?
