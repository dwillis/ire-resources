Investigative Reporting … for the Ear
(The Unique Elements of the Investigative Podcast)

1. My three most important ingredients for long form audio
a. A main source who listeners can recognize by voice
b. A main location where you take your mic to create “scenes”
c. A narrative, this-happened-then-this-happened structure that builds
toward a “reveal”
2. Consider if it really has to be an “investigation podcast”
a. Maybe it belongs on the web if there are lots of numbers, records, or
unnamed sources
b. Maybe it’s a Q/A show if there is no “scene”, main source, or “reveal”
c. Maybe it’s a series of features if your timeline (or time) is limited
3. Scene building
a. Scenes are identifiable, physical locations related to the story that
run for a defined period of time without changing to another scene
b. Record everything; 99% will never make it to air
c. Paradoxically, audio is very visual; slate or take notes of what you see
d. Record things that move (doors, walking, fidgeting), “Can you show
me?”, “Sorry, I like to collect cool sounds, can I record that?”, standups from key locations, speaker phone interviews from key locations
e. While reporting/outlining, internalize that “scenes” are the building
blocks to keep listeners engaged
4. Logistics
a. Create a searchable tape map (spread sheet) of all your tape
b. Use a searchable transcription service like otter.ai
c. Think about how you will organize, search, store, back-up, and share
lots of tape (google and dropbox get expensive)
d. Take notes after each interview with the mindset that future-you will
have to understand them to create the scene
e. Draft narrative outlines early and often; interview toward these
outlines
