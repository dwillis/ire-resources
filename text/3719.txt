9. What can data visualizations reveal
about the conduct of public officials?

Walker calendars
Through the state’s open records
law, we received Gov. Scott
Walker’s official calendars.
Center reporters then created a
database of all 4,414 entries.

Walker calendars
Reporters Kate Golden and Amy Karon
collaborated with La Crosse Tribune. The
story was picked up or cited by:
• more than a half a dozen Wisconsin
news organizations
• Center for Public Integrity
• Huffington Post
• New York Times

What we found
--Halved his official work time as he
raised funds nationwide.
--Spent more time in Washington, D.C.,
Utah and Arizona than northern
Wisconsin.
--Spoke to national Fox News more than
any media; 5 of top 7 conservative.
--Employees or PACs from more than
half of companies listed in calendars
were donors. 1/3 of CEOs donated.

Methodology
--For each entry, recorded the date; start
and end times; details ― “Wheels up for
Wausau,” etc.; the calendar type (“Drive
time,” “Media”)
--Flagged public relations, media time
and legislator time.
--Researched the people and companies
that appeared.

Methodology
--Standardized locations, geocoded them in
Refine using the Google Geocode Service,
determined county and other political
boundaries using Data Science Toolkit.
--Mapped the locations as a Google Fusion
Table.
--Pulled data into Tableau Public.
--Matched companies with campaign
finance database.
