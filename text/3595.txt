Census on a tight timeline
BY ADAM PLAYFORD / PALM BEACH POST

The situation
What we had

What we didn’t have

y Staff
{ Programmer
{ GIS guy
{ Web producer
{ Experienced census
reporter as editor

y Time

y Vision
{ Wanted very local data,
down to block groups

{ Programmer (me) starting

that same week a 3-month
stint as main Palm Beach
County reporter.
Ù Babies come when they
come, even if there’s no
embargo…
{ A few days max to prep, with
other things going on
{ Not enough time for a fullblown website

The vision
y NICAR Hackathon idea
y Change data on zoom
{ The controls are already there. People know how to use them.
Why do something more complex?

The plan
y Google Fusion Tables
{ Trade customizability for speed
{ Built-in choropleth maps from data and KML
Ù Choropleth maps: Where shades/colors represent numbers
Ù KML: Like a shapefile, can be made in ArcMap

{ Can map a ton of data: every tract in state, no sweat

y Reusable jQuery library
{ Take a Fusion Tables map
{ Show it on the page
{ When zoom changes, show a different map

The result
y Tradeoffs:
{ Less customization.
{ No charting.
{ On day-of, took longer than a pre-programmed solution. For
the next morning, not for right then.
y But!
{ Got something done
{ Met our goals in reasonable time
{ Have library that we’ve since used on other projects

The result
y On Twitter, Google says hi:

Thanks!
