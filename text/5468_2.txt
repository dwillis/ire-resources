“With no requirements for
background checks on most
private transactions, a Times
examination found, Armslist
and similar sites function as
unregulated bazaars, where
the essential anonymity of
the Internet allows
unlicensed sellers to
advertise scores of weapons
and people legally barred
from gun ownership to buy
them.”

conducted by private sellers with no background check.”
