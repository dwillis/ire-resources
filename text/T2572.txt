Campaign Finance Workshop
-But before we dive in, let me opine….
*Aron’s Pet Peeves:
- All politicians are greedy
- All campaign donations are evil
- Money equals ______________
(bribery/corruption, enter hyperbole here)
- All politicians are trying to hide something
* Myths
- Our system has never been worse
- Campaign finance reform is a national issue
- Campaign finance is not a people story
- Campaign finance is a numbers story

Campaign Finance Workshop
•Does it apply to me?
- Yes! No such thing as a local election
- Merging of national, state and local
Local/state never more important to the
parties national strategy
- Election predictions are just that…
You just never know
(Wellstone/Boschwitz)

Campaign Finance Workshop

•What to do?
- Start early (which you are)
- Gather resources
- There are two types of reporters: journalists
and stenographers.
- Convince your editors/producers that this
stuff is important

Campaign Finance Workshop
• In the arms race, the media is losing.
• Our sources are more sophisticated than we are, and,
worse, they know it.
• Our sources understand how the landscape has
changed, and we don’t.
• Worse still, they know that too.
• Bottom line is this: There is no such thing as a
strictly federal or strictly state or strictly local election
anymore.
…some examples of this done right, and how this can
be a local story…

The Detroit News
Data: The News gathered more
than 14,000 donation records for
all of the 200-plus local elections
and ballot proposals that took
place in 1999 in four suburban
counties and complied the
information into a computer
database.
Findings: The total suburban
campaign war chest exceed $2
million dollars. The amount spent
per campaign often exceed the
salary paid to the officeholder.
As a group developer, builders
and other real estate interest
gave the most, about $226,000.
Campaign records are often
incomplete, unreadable or
inaccurate.

The Detroit News
Data: Another great project the
News did, using its in-house
database. This shows the value
of databases when there is not
election to cover.
Findings: Political donors to
Wayne County Executive
Edward H. McNamara won 86
percent of the value of new
airport contracts put out for bid
last year. McNamara donors
were the sole bidder or faced just
one bidder in 60 percent of the
contracts they won. Metro
Airport's management team is
dominated by loyalists to
McNamara who had little
previous experience working for
another airport. And the top
managers have far fewer
qualifications than their
counterparts at other major
airports.

Virginian-Pilot
Data: Involved slicing out
contributions from individual
contributors to three different
candidates, and then
comparing them over time to
see how supporters
abandoned one candidate for
another.
Findings: To the opponent
went the spoils in the Virginia
gubernatorial primary last
year. After Mark Early won the
Republican primary, those
who supported his opponent
not only failed to contribute to
his campaign, but they actually
supported the candidate on
the other side of the aisle.

All About BCRA
• The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act has
changed not only campaign finance, but
the very nature of campaigns.
• As a reform, it is working as intended.
• But like any major change in the law,
unintended consequences.
• Unfortunately, the Act and its
repercussions make things harder (not
easier) for reporters.

All About BCRA
• The new law does many things, among
the most important are:
– Significantly restricts issue ads
– Increases contribution limits, and indexes
them to inflation
– Creates new kind of funding for state parties
– Actual criminal penalties in some cases for
breaking the law
– And eliminates soft money from federal
elections

Other BCRA Fun Facts
• State parties may be further up a creek because
they will be *required* to spend hard money or a
special form of soft money known as Levin funds
to pay for basic activities like voter identification,
GOTV and other similar functions. That’s true
even if those activities do not benefit the federal
candidate directly.
• Renewed incentive to go after the individual
contributor, and in particular networks of
contributors, i.e. Bush Pioneers.
• Internet is the way to go.

Other BCRA Fun Facts
• Electioneering Communications:
– Broadcast ads that identify a federal
candidate sponsored by or paid for with
corporate or union money are banned 30
days prior to a primary election or nominating
convention, and 60 days prior to a general
election.
– Individuals and some kinds of nonprofits are
exempt from this provision.
– Only applies to the candidate that is running.
