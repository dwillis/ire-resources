Five steps to finding and obtaining data

Step 1: Develop a data frame of mind
• Look for paper documents with information in neat columns and rows. If the
information looks like it came from a computer, it exists somewhere in a
computer. The trick is to find it.
• Think about what kind of information an agency or official would want in a
computer. Payrolls, case files, budgets, test scores, inspections etc. are too often
difficult to manage in paper form only.
• Don’t be put off by the lingo: Excel, Access, text files, database or dbf, comma
delimited, tab delimited, Oracle, SQL server. It’s all data you can use.
• Collections of archived pdf files can be turned into manageable data within a few
steps.
Step 2: Interview the data users
• Find everyone on your beat who asks for and uses reports created with
computerized data -- the end users.
• What kinds of routine reports does your agency create? How often? What specific
information is contained in these reports? What is the purpose of these reports?
• Ask how do you get these reports and who creates them?
• Try to get more than “Our IT department.” Get the names of the people in IT
responsible for key reports you would want.
Step 3: Interview the data keepers
• Get to know the people in IT, the computer geeks who control your access. Be
fascinated by what they do, what information they keep. Meet them in person
when you don’t need anything. Don’t just be another person demanding data from
them.
• If the department is large, learn the different roles each person plays. Often
different programmers are responsible for different data sets and only know about
their own data.
• Ask what data they keep. There may be other data sources that the end users are
not aware of.
Step 4: Figure out what data you want
• Don’t ask for everything at once. Ask for something small you can start off with.
• Example: Ask for a file of all pets licensed in your city. What’s the most common
dog and cat name? Who owns the most dogs or cats? Do your city officials have
their pets licensed?

Get fresh data. Ask the data keepers how often the data is updated and when. If
it’s two years old, it’s not worth asking for until they update it.
Make a data schedule. Consider an annual calendar marked with approximate
dates new sources of data will be available.

Step 5: Do your homework
• Know the law in your state. Most states allow access to electronic data. The devil
is in the details. Pay attention to the section about allowable fees. (More on that
later.)
• Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, www.rcfp.org, has a great online
guide to state-by-state laws and general tips about issues you will encounter.
• Also read court cases and attorney general opinions in your state regarding
electronic records.
Asking for data
• Ask for data at the lowest level possible. If the IT department has authority to
release it, ask them. Try to avoid asking the agency director if possible. If you
must, say ``We need some computerized data’’ and offer to speak directly to the
people in IT about the details.
• Put it in writing. Quote your state’s law regarding electronic records.
• If your state law is silent or doesn’t require the agency to make electronic records
public, point out the public benefits of obtaining the data this way.
• Give the agency credit in the paper for turning over data quickly.
• Ask for as many years of data as you can manage. You want to see patterns over
time.
• Asking for a lot of data freaks people out. Be prepared. Saving five years’ worth
of data to a CD shouldn’t take a lot more work than saving one year’s worth of
data.
• Know the file limitations of the programs you will use. Excel 2002 has a
limitation of 66,000 rows. Access has a file limit of 2 gigs.
What to ask for
• You don’t want their software, only the data out of the computer.
• Ask for a text file (.txt) or a tab- or comma-delimited file. This is a universal
format almost any program can use and almost any program (yes even theirs) can
spit out.
• Ask for a code sheet, that will tell you what is in coded data. Example: 1=male
and 2=female.
• Ask for a data layout guide, showing how long each field is and what type of
data, numeric or text, is in the field.

•
•

Find out whether the data is a “flat file” or a relational data. Flat files have all the
data in one easy table. Relational databases split it up in several tables you have to
knit together using key fields.
If all of this fails, don’t forget you can always create your own database from
paper records.

Roadblocks: “We can’t get it out of our computer”
• Ask what software they are using. Google that product, go to the web site or call
the manufacturer and find out how to export a file. Then help your agency do its
job!
• If they can print out data, they can do a “print to file” command. This is not ideal
since the data is static and will require lots of work to become manageable.
Roadblocks: “We’re getting a new computer system in a few months.’’
• Don’t fall for this one. Say, “That’s great but I need the data now.”
• It doesn’t matter what kind of system they have or will have. If they existed,
computers that couldn’t export data would be an incredible waste of public money
and possibly a violation of your state’s open records act.
Roadblocks: Privacy
• Since 9/11, agencies have increasingly closed down access to data, citing privacy
or homeland security concerns.
• Make them cite a law allowing them to withhold the data and to put the denial in
writing.
• Some state open records laws, including Oklahoma’s, have a presumption of
openness unless there is a specific exemption.
• Be willing to accept redacted data without personal identifiers if you believe the
data is truly exempt.
Roadblocks: Fees
• Many states have language allowing agencies to charge only the direct cost of
producing the records.
• Watch out for fees for ``programming.’’ If the programming fee is $100 an hour,
that means the employee makes $40,000 per week!
• Watch out for ``run time,’’ or the time it takes the computer to spit out your data.
This should be miniscule if it is charged at all, especially with a large agency with
many computers.
