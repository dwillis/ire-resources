SO WHAT EXACTLY IS R?
ROBERT!

In the 1980s, Bell Labs developed a new
statistical software called “S.”
AT&T went public with the software (“S-PLUS”),
but that cost $$.
In 1994, two researchers (Ross Ihaka and Robert
Gentleman) developed the first S-like program
that wasn’t S, and they called it R.
Unlike S, R would turn into the statistical
language of the people, meaning it would be free
and open-source.
Although R is similar to S-PLUS, it has become
something in its own right.
Over the years, the program has extended
beyond the statistics community, and now is
used by numerous fields from epidemiologists
and research doctors to quants, political
scientists, and of course, data journos!

WHY USE R?

R is free!
R is open source (anyone can download and modify the code)!
R has a great community!
R is not just a statistical program--it’s a programming language, allowing
you to make your own functions, code, and have the freedom to really dig
into your data unlike you ever have before.
R can be used on any type of computer (even in the cloud!).
With R, you can make pretty sweet looking graphics.
R can work with any language, any database.
R’s range of complexity: from basic descriptive stats to multivariate
regressions and beyond.

WHY SHOULD JOURNOS USE R?

Because it’s not hard. Although there is a learning curve, once
you get to the first plateau, you’ll find that its much much
better than the alternatives.
Can deal with millions of data points and huge files (much
better than excel).
Because it’s a programming language, you can save your
history to make your data manipulation reproducible for your
colleagues but also for the data community at large.
Eventually you will hit a wall with other programs, but with R,
the range of complexity will allow you to try and eventually
master more advanced statistical techniques such as
regressions and modeling. The environment encourages
experimentation!
