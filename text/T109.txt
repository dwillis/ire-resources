Covering the Border: Beginner's Guide
Prepared by Aida Bustos, assistant metro editor, The San Diego
Union-Tribune, with the assistance of Gregory Gross and
Fernando Romero, staff writers who cover the border.
The process of gathering news south of the border is much
the same as here. You still have to talk to the right people,
go to the right places and come up with sound conclusions.
But the process of reporting is going to be slower because very
often you are going to have to talk to key people in person.
Border cities are not identical and should not be treated
as if they were. Tijuana does not have much in common with
Juarez, and even less with Nogales.
If you do not treat cities
and towns on the U.S. side of the border as if they were all
alike, why would you treat sites across the border from
them that way?
Be aware of your biases about Mexico and Mexicans, They can
lead to inaccuracies in your copy. The country and its people
are not Hollywood stereotypes, Be open to the diverseness of
Mexico and its citizens,

-on. Getting Information
If you need to contact a government agency south of the border,
the following offices within that agency can be a good place
to start: T'Comunicacion Social," "Relaciones Publicas" and
"Of icina de Prensa" (Press Off ice),
If you don't find these, try the mayor or his secretary,
she knows everything. The mayor is called "el presidente
municipal" or "alcalde. I'
Personal relationships are very important in Nexico. Try
to establish and nurture relationships with people who have
access at all levels of government.
Be prepared to go office hopping to get your information.
Do not expect to get a lot of information over the phone,
particularly if people do not know you personally.
Try to establish more than one source for the same information,
Often, key offices do not communicate with each other
quickly, so try to confirm information.
You cannot be a clock-watcher and cover the border.
Be flexible. Try to get things done as early as possible
because you hit that dead zone in the middle of the afternoon
when it can be impossible to find someone. People leave for
lunch at about 2 p.m. and may be gone anywhere from two hours
until the next day, Generally, officials start around 8 a.m.
and work until 7 p,m. or later.

Paper Name: UNION-TRIBUNE
Pub. Date: 16-Feb-1992 Sunday
Headline: No, Toto, Tijuana isn't Kansas, but it certainly isn't hell,
either
By1ine : GREGORY GROSS
Dateline: TIJUANA
Creditline: GREGORY GROSS covers the border region for The San Diego
Union-Tribune.
TIJUANA - - In the Vietnam war movie "Hamburger Hill," there's a scene in
which an Army medic is giving by-the-bookinstructions on dental care to a
group of green replacements, one of whom just couldn't take it seriously.
The medic, not amused, fixes him with an acetylene stare and says:
"If you want to come out of this in one piece, you will listen to people
who know."
The man who did so much to prepare me for Tijuana was someone who knew. We
met more than a decade ago, only briefly and only once, but I will never
forget him.
He was a municipal police officer, on the corner of Avenida Revolucion and
Ninth Street. I was driving with my wife and some friends when the officer
gestured for me to turn left and pull up to the curb in front of him.
Now, I wasn't an expert on Mexican vehicle codes, but I remembered that
California law says explicitly: Always obey the orders of a police officer.
I made the turn and stopped.
.c

"Good afternoon, senor," he said in easily understood English. "I have to
give you a ticket."
"Why?" I asked.
"You made an illegal left turn."
Ignoring for the moment that I had made the turn in the first place only
because he had told me to, I asked him what it was about the turn that was
illegal. He couldn't tell me, but insisted that it had been illegal. He
then asked for my identification and took a cursory look through the
passenger compartment of the car.
At that point, for reasons that remain a mystery, he decided to let me off
with a verbal warning, the words of which have remained with me to this
day :
"Now remember, ~ e G o rGross. In Mexico, the rules are the same, but
different."
We laughed about it for a long time thereafter. But as the years have
passed and I continued to work off and on as a journalist in Baja
California, I found myself thinking about those words more and more - - and
laughing less and less. Because in more ways than one, he was right.

-

Those with the suburban view of Tijuana come here expecting to find
everything "just like home," only to find that, like Toto, they aren't in

Kansas anymore, or anywhere else in the United States.
All the familiar symbols are there - - sidewalks, traffic lights, buildings
of glass and steel. But from the moment they drive across the border and
find themselves suddenly cut off by one of the local drivers who whips
across traffic, they know they are in a very unfamiliar place.
There is rule of law here, just as "at home." But the laws are based on
different legal outlooks - - and often loosely interpreted and selectively
enforced. What you know counts for less than who you know and how well.

At the other end of the spectrum, those who think of Tijuana as some sort
of unearthly hell inhabited only by uneducated beggars and oily criminals
are stunned to learn that this place is producing writers, artists, actors,
musicians, scholars. That it boasts not merely schools, but universities,
and a cultural center on a par with virtually anything in San Diego.
This is more literally a frontier town than anyplace most Americans will
ever get to visit, a place where cleanliness may not always be next to
godliness, but ambition definitely is; where improvisation in the face of
difficulty is a daily-exercised character trait.
It also is a place where, as in the rest of Mexico, a person meeting you
fcr the first time may address you as su servidor, your servant, but who
definitely does not expect to be thought of or treated like one.
As with a lot of other things in life, the truth - - or better, the many
truths - - about ~ifuanalie somewhere in between those extremes.
-

.

Through this column, and those that follow, we'll start to explore some of
those truths - - the good, the bad and the ugly, and the beautiful.
The other half of that "we" is Fernando Romero, with whom I share office
space and deadlines in Tijuana.
Aside from being one hell of a good journalist, he knows this region in
ways that I never will, because he's lived in it.
He understands how things are supposed to work and why they often don't. He
recognizes almost instantly all the little subtleties embedded in the
multilayered realities of life in this city.
In short, he knows.
I'm lucky to be working with him. You're lucky to have a chance to read
him.
Me? I see this place through the eyes of a perpetual visitor. I see a city
growing, changing, reinventing itself almost every day, teaching me
something I didn't know the day before.
Between the two of us, then, we'll be doing our best to listen to the
people who know: The people - - Mexicans and foreigners alike - - who live
and work and play here, and who are shaping the intertwined destinies of
this city and its northern neighbor, San Diego.

Stay with us. It's going to be interesting.
