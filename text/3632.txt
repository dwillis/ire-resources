Lead batteries: recyclcing leads US
companies to export risk to Mexico

Databases for reporting the story
Databases highlight lack of EPA oversight and how federal
rules designed to ensure safety are being ignored

* International Trade Commission offers detailed import and

export records on a wide range of goods. dataweb.usitc.gov

* USGS data tracks mineral imports and exports
http://minerals.usgs.gov/

* EPA data tracks approved exports of hazardous material like
leabd

* Semarnat, the Mexican agency overseeing recycling,

maintains data on licensed facilities and projected capacity

* US customs officials maintain records that include seizures

Flow of unregulated chemicals flow
from China into pharmaceuticals in the
US and developed nations
Bad actors among prominent suppliers

Databases for reporting the story
Databases how Chinese companies with criminal histories,
including top executives jailed for illegal shipments, were
supplying major drug manufacturers with unregulated key
chemical ingredients
* Chinese data documenting licensed chemical facilities
* Database built for those companies appearing at prominent
international industry conventions
* FDA data on prosecutions and seized imports
* FDA data on international inspections
* Scraped data on chemicals offered for sale
* Database built on each company to programmatically send
emails seeking comment early in the story
* Database built on prosecutions done outside the United
States, culled from clips and other sources

World-class athletes compete at the
Olympics not for their native land
Documenting country hopping

Databases for reporting the story
* USOC data of all athletes who have competed for the
United States for three decades

* Database built from scraped athlete biographies
* Database built from congressional legislation that hotwired
citizenship

* Data to determine the US athletes whose dream of making
the Olympic team was thwarted

* Country medal counts for each Olympics to show effects

More Examples
* Plane English: NASA ASRS data to document widespread

miscommunication in the US and around the world as pilots
and controllers are unable to speak English despite
international treaties, leading to crashes, near misses and a
Russian jet trying to land on a Seattle highway

* Lobbying for regimes: FARA data documenting who is

lobbying. Cameroon pushes for US aid it has been ruled
ineligible to receive, hiring MLK aide for push

* Brain drains: H2B visa data documenting how the US
attracts professionals from developing nations

* US Treasury’s OFAC records on sanctions
* Long history of computer-asssited reporting: from Brasil’s
Nunca Mais to South Africa’s mining permits

Common threads
While there are many difficulties obtaining data, some types
of data tends to be more common

* These stories are doable.
* Data for business transactions, including licensed
companies, tends to be more accessible

* Whiffs of promising material is often suppressed in
aggregate data

* Don’t be afraid to build your own databases
* Think outside the box about data sets that can be

combined. The power of this kind of work is often taking
different data from different sources, comparing them and
finding the sparks.
