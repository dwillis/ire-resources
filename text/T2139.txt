Getting started on electronic voting issues
General resources on the problem
· Verified Voting: http://www.verifiedvoting.org - organizing
· Douglas Jones’ web site: http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~jones/voting/
· Electionline – has a very nice interactive map showing what voting systems are in
use across the United States: http://www.electionline.org/
· Black Box Voting: http://www.blackboxvoting.org/ - also
http://www.blackboxvoting.com/ (a different site)
· The Electronic Frontier Foundation: http://www.eff.org/Activism/E-voting/
Documented problems with voting systems:

Proposed partial legislative fixes:
· Rep. Rush Holt’s HR2239, Sen. Bob Graham’s S.1980
· (there are others – Hillary Clinton has a bill also – but my understanding is that
they are less stringent than S.1980)
Some people don’t think there’s a big problem:
· The voting machine vendors – many of whom are represented by Harris Miller of
the ITAA
· Ted Selker at MIT
Citizens’ groups in your area can be good resources. Verifiedvoting.org and the EFF
have been maintaining lists of these.
