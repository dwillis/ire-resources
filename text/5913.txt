2019 IRE: SQL Hands-On Daylong Session

USING THIS TUTORIAL
This tutorial is based on the following curriculum written by Troy Thibodeaux and maintained
by Serdar Tumgoren at Stanford: https://a-gentle-introduction-tosql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
The class began with a presentation by Troy that can be found here:
https://prezi.com/bdoldoh5tk4e/gentle-introduction-to-sql-using-sqlite/
This class uses DB Browser for SQLite. We went back and forth between the tutorial dataset
and the review exercises dataset, which included a hands-on portion with actual Legos. The
data for both the tutorial and review exercises can be found here, along with additional
documentation and walk-through materials (for the tutorial, follow steps.html; for the review,
follow the powerpoint presentation). Youâ€™re on your own in acquiring the Legos.
