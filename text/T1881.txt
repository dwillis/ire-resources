Adventures in Trend-spotting
The problem: Take a decade's worth of air pollution data and show whether the long-term trend shows
improvement or degradation, or something in between.
The data source: California's Air Resources Board, which offers a free CD with data, maps and a nifty
interactive program for displaying both. The web site (http://www.arb.ca.gov/aqd/aqdcd/aqdcd.htm) also
has hourly data back to 1980 available for download. Almost all states collect and distribute similar data.
The process: Most of the data is in DBF files that can be
imported into Access with a couple of keystrokes. From
there, you can construct queries to extract data for a
single monitoring station (station ID numbers and
locations are in a separate file) and export the resulting
data to Excel.
The files have readings for a dozen pollutants, presented
more than 20 different ways. Here's an excerpt with the
maximum daily one-hour and eight-hour average ozone
readings for the Clovis monitor, which is important
because it's about two miles from my house (see right):
Unfortunately, what we have here is just a jumble of
numbers. Even if you scanned the entire file from top to
bottom, it would be impossible to figure out the trend.
You can use the Excel Chart Wizard to create a line
graph for columns A and B, the date and one-hour ozone
levels, but even that doesn't help much (below):
Because ozone is a
summertime pollutant,
the levels are high in the
summer and approach
zero in the winter. If you
eyeball this graph, it
looks as if the
summertime peaks are
edging upward, but it's hard to say for sure. Besides, it's not just the peaks
that we're worried about. There are a whole lot of values in the middle of
this chart that are high enough to cause problems for the most sensitive
people, and it's not at all clear which way those values are going.
What we need is a way to boil down these peaks and valleys to a long-term
trend.

One of the ways that statisticians find patterns in data is to do a linear regression, and Excel fortunately has
a built-in way to add a regression line to the chart we were building on the last page. After you've finished
the chart, just
right-click on the
data line and click
"Add Trendline,"
and you can lay
down a nice, clean
regression line
over the data, just
like this:
This clearly shows
a long-term rising
trend in the data.
There's just one
thing wrong: As
any competent
statistician will
tell you (and lucky
for me, one did), a
simple linear
regression doesn't
work with data
that involves a "time series" like this one. The full explanation of that, I am sure, would be too boring to go
into even if I understood it. What it comes down to, though, is this: The seasonal pattern in this data is so
strong that it overwhelms any other pattern that a regression analysis might show you.
This problem is not unique to air pollution data.
Economists run into it when theyâ€™re studying things like
retail sales, which rise and fall with the calendar. And
there are tools available for dealing with it, such as the
Census Bureau's X-ARIMA model. But even if you have
the intellectual capacity to use something like that,
you're still left with a significant problem -- explaining it
to your readers. Just saying, "Trust me, my computer
says there's a trend here" probably isn't the best
approach.
Here's another alternative: A 365-day (or annual)
moving average. It's not too hard to explain -- for each
day, it's just the average of the past year's daily values.
That's why it's called a "moving" average. If today is
June 5, 2003, then the 365-day moving average for today
is the average of all daily values from June 6, 2002,
through today. Tomorrow's 365-day moving average, in
turn, would be the average of daily values from June 7,
2002, through June 6, 2003.
Here's how you write a formula to get that from Excel
(at right). Note that we can't compute the 365-day
average until we have 365 days of data, so we start with
the 365th day (in row 366; row 1 has the column names):
On the next page, we'll graph this average.

Here it is:
I've also added data from a second
station to the graph, so that we can
compare trends in two different parts of
the state.
We're on a little bit firmer ground now.
With this graph, and an explanation of
what a 365-day moving average is, we
can say with some confidence that the
1990s saw one-hour daily ozone peaks
decline in Azusa, a traditional ozone hot
spot in southern California. At the same
time, the peaks edged upward in Clovis.
Beginning sometime in 1996, as one can
see, ozone levels at the central
California station began to exceed those
at the southern California station.
At this point in our reporting, we are
ready for quality control. When we did this in real life, we showed our graphs to various experts at the state
and local air pollution control agencies. We also explained how we did the analysis and asked for their
comments on it.
All agreed that the 365-day moving average was a valid way to show the long-term trend. But one expert at
the Air Resources Board went a step further. He encouraged us to throw out the winter values and look
only at the summer data. His reasoning: Although no one knows for sure, it's considered likely that very
low levels of ozone are not a health threat. The state's one-hour ozone standard of 0.09 parts per million is
exceeded regularly in the summer. But in winter, typical levels are far less than that. And an increase from
0.02 to 0.03 is clearly not as important as an increase from 0.12 to 0.13. Yet our 365-day moving average
would regard them both as important.
The ARB expert suggested a number of alternative
approaches. We decided that some of them were
inappropriate, such as using the number of times each
station's ozone value exceeded the standards each year
(among other problems, that approach would treat a
value of 0.20 as no different from a value of 0.13).
We finally chose one that was doubly elegant, being
both easy to calculate and easy to explain. For each
year, we calculated and plotted just one value -- the
average daily peak for the summer smog season, May
1 through October 31.
Here's what that table looks like (at right):

Here's what the
resulting graph looks
like in Excel:

And in the newspaper, with more recent data
added, along with a corresponding graph for
eight-hour ozone readings:
