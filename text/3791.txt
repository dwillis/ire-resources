Disparities in city services
“Racial gap found in
pothole patching” –
August 2008
Starting out as data
story, then a mapping
story and finally a
statistical story

Disparities in city services (cont)
The beauty of
this story was
its simplicity
and also that
bad roads
affect
everyone

Disparities in
water usage
“Water use highest
in poor areas of
the city”
Mapping and
statistical analysis

Disparities in traffic stops and
searches

Dennis Walton, outreach director at
the Milwaukee Fatherhood Initiative,
said he feels he was the victim of
racial profiling in a 2009 incident
when he was stopped by police on
the south side.

“Racial gap
found in traffic
stops in
Milwaukee”
Data and
mapping
analysis

Traffic stop disparities
First time in Wisconsin that racial data was
collected for traffic stops and searches
Story generated a lot of discussion and
blowback from Milwaukee police, who
never disputed my findings.
We built a basic Google Fusion map to
allow users to explore the traffic/search
data

We built a database of 500
people who had been granted
or denied pardons during the
Bush administration

We started with a list of nearly
2,000 people. From that, we
pulled a random sample. Then
spent months researching the
individuals.
We found that even after
controlling for other factors,
whites were more likely to get
a pardon.

Our variables
Race
Number of years from sentencing to petition
Offense
Sentence
Gender
Marital status
Bankruptcy, liens, judgments
Crime in military
Letter from the official

In response to a FOIA request,
we received correspondence
from members of Congress to
the Office of the Pardon
Attorney. From that, we built a
database of characteristics
from the letters to see if
applicants benefitted from the
correspondence.
We found that applicants with
letters, though fewer than the
total sample, were more likely
to be pardoned.

Our methodology
Logistic regression – when outcome is binary
Bounced methodology and findings off many experts
Shared our findings with DOJ

Challenges
Very little information to begin with
Crimes were very old in some cases
Individuals were difficult to find

The Dallas Morning News used a
random sample of non-capital
murder cases to build a database
based on hard-copy juror
questionnaires.

Three rounds of analysis after
bouncing off subjects and
experts
Demographically based
Voir dire
Socioeconomics

Bulletproofing your analysis
Add every variable you can to make sure
something else is not explaining the outcome
variable.

Bulletproofing your analysis
Add every variable you can to make sure
something else is not explaining the outcome
variable
Assume that you might be wrong

Bulletproofing your analysis
Add every variable you can to make sure
something else is not explaining the outcome
variable
Assume that you might be wrong
Watch for multicollinearity --- or variables that
explain each other such as race and income.
Keep detailed notes so you can explain what you
did
White paper

Find the right methodology
Read research reports
Find an existing model
Find an expert

Dealing with documents
Data entry
Data entry firms --- but use verification if you can
afford it
Intern entry – definitely double enter
Mechanical Turk – Amazon service for small-task
data gathering – if you have a U.S. office or
collaborator

THE REALITY
We notice race/ethnicity within 150 ms (Ito & Urland, 2003)
Attention, perception, judgment, and memory continue to be
influenced by target race

Yet when it comes to a disparity in any given outcome or decision,
default tendency is to deny race played any role

WHY?
People lie (self-presentation)
Influence of race is often unconscious (implicit bias)
Admitting the influence of race is ego threatening (rationalization)
We conceptualize racial bias in terms of stable disposition

“COLORBLINDNESS” AND DAILY INTERACTION
Priming participants with colorblind ideology increases scores on
measures of racial bias (Richeson & Nussbaum, 2004)
Using “colorblind” interaction strategy also leads to social costs

“COLORBLINDNESS” AND DAILY INTERACTION
Is it a woman?
Is the background blue?
Brown eyes?
Wearing earrings?
Bushy eyebrows?
Dimples?
Are teeth visible?

WHEN THE PENDULUM SWINGS BACK

SO WHAT’S AN INTREPID REPORTER TO DO?
Take self-reports with a grain of salt
Focus on aggregated data versus one-shot anecdote
Find strongest support by triangulating research methods (since any
one type of study has inherent limitations)
Pre-emptively assess alternative, race-neutral explanations
