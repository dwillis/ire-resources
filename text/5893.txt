TIP SHEET
HOW TO EVOLVE YOUR “TRUE CRIME” PODCAST
●

This should go without saying, but is often forgotten in true crime: something terrible has
happened to many of the characters in the story. Treat them with sensitivity during both
interviewing and editing. Imagine the victims and the accused and all their family
members listening to the podcast when it’s released.

●

Have an overarching question driving your reporting, something other than “whodunnit?”
The question should drive at the flaws or deeper systemic issues connected to the case.

●

Situate the case within its broader context. The time and place where the crime
happened matters. How has history impacted the case? How about race? The
environment? The economy? Learn the town by going to church or football or jury duty
or parades or whatever people there do! It can also be helpful to let the town learn you,
so people aren’t freaked out when you show up on their doorstep.

●

Don’t manipulate the audience. The goal of any serious reporting is to get deep and
create understanding, not to sensationalize.

●

Create realistic expectations for listeners. If you’re not going to solve the crime, don’t
make it sound like you will.

●

Record every step of your process. Reveal the process to listeners.

●

Learn the case inside and out. Get the court transcripts and the investigative file. Read
them all and write down the names of everyone that appears in them.

●

Redo the investigation yourself, piece by piece. Interview every person whose name
appears in the case file. If they’re dead, interview their relatives. Not everyone’s great at
answering the phone… don’t be afraid to knock on doors (Daylight only! Beware of
dogs!). Understand the backgrounds of key people and include their names in your
records searches. Think about how to order your interviews: start with subjects who are
unlikely to make the rest of your reporting more difficult.

●

Use your website to complement the audio. For people who haven’t necessarily heard
the episodes, try making richly visual presentations of complex data analysis and
findings or quick and easy explainers about major issues. For the super nerds who want
more after they’re heard the episodes, post source documents and longer in-depth
pieces on topics that couldn’t totally fit in the audio.

ON SEARCHING FOR OLD PUBLIC RECORDS IN SMALL TOWNS:
●

A local police department or county clerk may not have email. They may never have
received a public records request from a reporter. They may not know what their legal
obligations are under their state’s open records act. Be patient. Help them help you.

●

Go in person. Act like a nice normal human. Build a rapport. These clerks will become
your best friends.

●

Ask questions to get a better picture of what’s going on: What types of records do you
keep? How long do you keep them? Where are they located? How are they organized?
If you don’t know, who would?

●

In small offices in small towns, a clerk may literally not have the bandwidth to help you.
Here’s where you offer up your labor as a favor to them… and as a favor to yourself. The
best thing that could ever happen is that you get left alone… just you and the records.
GET ACCESS.

●

Always look and listen for things you don’t know you’re looking and listening for. Stay
alert, especially if you’re now embedded in some government building, quietly scanning.
This really lame bureaucratic records hunt you’re on is an enormous opportunity to
observe the inner workings of the office and to meet people who may later become
valuable sources.

●

Bring your own scanner. Get one that is small and fast. It will save you an ENORMOUS
amount of time and money.

●

Bring a staple remover. STAPLES ARE THE ENEMY.

●

Leave the records tidier than when you found them. Be a gracious guest in their space.

●

Once you’re out of there, dump everything off of your thumb drive/phone ASAP.
Back-up your files in at least two places.

●

Name all the files with a standard naming convention. Here’s a good one:
YYYYMMDD_Agency_Type of Record_Detail (ie. 19940226_Winona PD_offense
report_Odell Hallmon cocaine possession).

●

Make sure you actually go through all the documents you’ve scanned (you don’t want
any valuable nuggets to get lost in the shuffle!). Have a way of synthesizing the info on
all the disparate records and organizing it into something coherent. We love timelines.
Use citations in your timelines, so you know where each detail came from.
