Just add water – a recipe for a story or two

In modern water distribution the use of plastic pipes has become widespread.
But there are two major problems with the plastic pipes:
1/ The pipes release chemicals into the drinking water. Some of the chemicals are
considered to be potential endocrine disrupters.
Documentation:
-Tests made at the technical university of Denmark (DTU) by D. Brocca, E. Arvin
and H. Mosbæk published in “Water Research”. Reference number: Water Research,
36, 3675-3680. 2002

Additional story ideas:
-Bacteria in the drinking water can use some of the chemicals as food and thereby
increase their growth. See the Danish EPA website: www.mst.dk for “Release of
organic substances from polymeric materials – microbial growth”, Environmental
Project No. 718, Danish EPA 2002

2/ The plastic pipes are unable to protect the drinking water from pollution.
Gasoline, oil, solvents etc. are capable of penetrating the pipes and contaminating the
water.
-Search high and low for pollution cases – ask the local environmental authorities and
the municipalities. Tip: these cases are common in driveways and at gas stations.
