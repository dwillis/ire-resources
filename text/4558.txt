Interviewing Liars
“Who’s going to believe a con artist or a liar?”
“Everyone, if he’s good.”
THE HUMAN AUDIT
The Human Audit is an investigative tool and resource that will assist the interviewer,
whether government, law enforcement, or competitive business to focus on the art of
detecting deception and eliciting responses and the techniques to elicit factual and
credible information.
1 – Assess Appearance – Everything is important about a person of interest and of
whom we communicate. Never take for granted how a person is dressed, how a
person walks, how a person sits, what a person eats or drink, it is all relevant in
assessing that person’s behavior for the present, and possibly the future.
2 – Build Trust, Relationships, and Rapport – Social influence plays a major role in
establishing trust. Social influence is one of the pillars in developing rapport and
relationships.
3 – Establish a Baseline of Behavior – There are no absolute ways to detect deception
based solely on behavioral analysis. However, when used as a complement to your
elicitation skills, you may become a better collector of information.
4 – Consider Cultural Differences if Relevant – These are a set of learned beliefs,
values and behaviors that may differ from yours. Learn the basic behaviors of those
from different cultures. The more you know, the influence you will have in the
interview.
5 – Identify and Overcome Countermeasures – These are efforts (physical and/or
psychological) that a person will try to use against you to prevent you from staying on
target or getting the required information. It is designed to mislead you and persuade
you into believing they are being truthful.

6 – Develop an Interview Strategy – Preparation is the key to gathering accurate and
reliable information; not necessarily to obtain an admission of guilt or wrongdoing, but
to tell a story.
7 – Create a “Bridge of Understanding” or a Story that allows you to relate and the
Interviewee to recall the Truth. The ability to persuade someone is not in itself
abnormal or new. Learning to identify what influences a person to trust another person
relies on you putting yourself in the shoes of that person. The ability to place you in
the other person’s shoes requires a combination of street smarts, savvyness, and an
understanding of various cultures. This combination increases your ability to identify
weaknesses, flaws or vulnerabilities in that person and enables you to achieve the
ultimate goal of obtaining truthful information.
