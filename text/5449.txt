Different ways to store data:
Key step to getting data is understanding the common
ways agencies can give it to you:

• Text Fixed-width (column width same for all lines)

• Text Delimited (columns split by character, such
as comma)

• “Softwared” (Excel

Access

)

A primer on crunching
Another key is figuring out what questions you want to answer:
-Just look at a small set of numbers?
-Match people on one list to another?
-Look at thousands of records? Millions? Tens of millions?
-See how different places compare?
• Based on answer, here are ways to crunch:
• Excel – basic spreadsheet program
• Access – relational DB (import two or more
spreadsheets and ‘join’)
• MySQL/ others – based on written instructions for
heavy data loads (often use with “GUI” like Navicat)
• QGIS/ Mapping – for, well, mapping things

Data type: Identifiable
• Best kind – name, DOB,
address, etc.
• Typically from places
housing inmates
– State DOCs
– County jails/ city lockups

• Court data (hopefully)
• Police lists of certain people
(arrestees/ fugitives/ sex
offenders)

Example: DUI fines
See at:

• Obtained one county’s court system
• Crunched in Excel to determine people
charged with DUI, case outcomes
• Determined some suburbs cutting lucrative
deals to keep defendants’ record clear

Example: Fleeing fugitives
See at https://tinyurl.com/NICARfugitive1
and https://tinyurl.com/NICARfugitive2

• Obtained warrant DBs from as many
states as possible
• Obtianed prisoner DBs from as many
states as possible
• Compared and found people wanted in
one state later imprisoned in another
• Dug into hits to see if stopped by police,
traditional shoe-leather reporting

Masked data
• Sometimes agencies can’t (or won’t) release
personally identifiable data
• BUT law may require them to release other
data points, and insert unique ID in place of
name
• Court data (particularly those not convicted)
• Driver charge/ conviction data

Example: Supervisions
see at https://tinyurl.com/NICARsupervision

• IL allows special probation for
traffic cases – limit to 2/ year.
• All counties report them Illinois SOS, but IL SOS
by law can’t release names
• IL SOS did release them masked with unique IDs
• Crunched to determine which unique IDs had
more than two in a 12-month period

Example: 100 mph club
See https://tinyurl.com/NICAR100mph
• Illinois State Police kept DB of all
speeding tickets, but won’t release
names of ticketed
• Masked dataset listed other things,
including speed at time of ticket and
ticket #
• Typed in each ticket number to court
DBs, got defendant name and case
disposition to show what happened

Statistical data
• Agencies may take their raw data, crunch it
and compile statistics
• Often for reporting to state/ federal agencies
• Can get that data from state/ feds (such as
inmate census/ UCR)

Example: Harvey
See www.chicagotribune.com/harvey

• Idea: Chicago has 270 suburbs.
Find
one with high crime and little
success solving cases
• Turned to state UCR data
• Crunched to determine which
town (Harvey) was worst.
• Used as basis to explore whole range of issues,
with other datasets and shoe-leather reporting

Tips
• Identifiable can include officers, discipline
• If have online search, can produce dataset (look
for all fields put online to seek at least those
fields)
• Attempt to get freshest compiled data (some
agencies may have it but be waiting to post)
• Local agencies fill out surveys, send compiled
data to state/ feds. FOIA that for clues on issues
and what’s available
• Cleaning is often major challenge, so go to a
cleaning class too!
