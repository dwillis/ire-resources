Strategies for Covering the Police Beat and Doing Quick Enterprise Stories
 Develop sources. Get to know the players in the department. Commanders.
Detectives. People who know what’s going on and would be willing to help
you. Take them to lunch or for coffee. Call them or email them often, even
when you don’t want anything in particular. Cops appreciate that.
 Look for crime trends/patterns. Are burglaries or sexual assaults occurring
in a certain part of town at a high rate? Is the department solving them
quickly or do they take a back seat to other crimes such as homicides? Most
departments now put those statistics online. I wrote a story on an unusually
high number of burglaries in a particular neighborhood. What made the
story a front pager was that the commander of that district and an assistant
chief who lived in that district both had their homes burglarized. When the
commander called police, they didn’t show up; when the assistant chief called
in his burglary, officers went to the wrong house. If police showed up when
residents called, some of the officers wouldn’t even have a pen or pad to take
the complaint.
 Do ridealongs. Hang out with a detective or commander once a month. You’d
be surprised at what you might see and hear. Cops can be chatty,
particularly when they’re away from the office. It’s also a great opportunity
to cultivate sources. I did a ridealong with a commander, detectives and even
the police chief and his top deputy. What emerged was a Sunday magazine
cover story.
 Get the names (and dates of birth) of all sworn officers. Look for those on
administrative leave and find out how long they’ve been out and why. Is it
for a criminal matter?
You can also run the names of all officers against criminal court records to
see what comes up. Are officers from a particular recruiting class getting into
trouble?
 Attend public hearings. Many city councils have subcommittees that handle
judiciary matters. Some of my best stories came from those hearings, which
largely go uncovered by the media.

 Check out complaints against officers filed with the Citizen Complaint
Review Board. Are there large numbers of excessive use of force complaints?
 Budgets. Review the department’s annual budget to see where the money is
going.
 Get every blank form in the police department. It will give you an idea of the
documents they collect. Having the forms also allows you to familiarize
yourself with what information is public and what isn’t.
