What it means to be a Lonely Coder
Some possibilities:
●
●
●
●

No peers
Other responsibilities
Trouble convincing/evangelizing
You need resources: time, servers, admin access, paid online services,
learning materials

A Disclaimer
“Lonely Coder” is a useful term, not a real-life under-class
● Most of us NICAR are probably lonely coders
● NICAR is actually very inviting to beginners
● We tend to over-estimate the skills of our peers

What we’re going to do today
● Show you resources tools and techniques that get you started fast
● Show you how to leverage early wins to get buy-in and goodwill
from your colleagues
● Encourage you to reach out to your Lonely colleagues on the
internets

Interactive Tables

Tables can be rad

Easiest data viz to get off the ground
The majority of the data you encounter will be tabular:

Pretty it up

Sample Code

Make that table sortable

Make it sortable, searchable AND paginated

The importance of Github

I cannot overstate the importance of Github as a learning tool. The ability to
“Frankenstein” projects, or take projects that you know to be functional and
replace bits and pieces to customize them, is a great way to learn on the job.

Browser developer tools

Browser developer tools are some of the strongest diagnostic tools that you’ll
come across when trying to fix web-based issues. Browser developer tools are
also a great way to get a look at dynamically-generated CMS code so you can
manipulate it with CSS or javascript.

Community: LCC / NICAR-L
“Lonely, but not alone”
Joining online coder communities is essential if you’re trying to go it alone.
When you’re on deadline and you’re just not understanding the problems you’re
up against, it’s invaluable to know that you’ve got a support system of more
experienced coders.
You can and should also use these communities as a way of sharing ideas and
expanding your knowledge of how others are solving data journalism problems
with code.

Let me google that for you...

Learn how to ask the Google questions. Not all questions are created equal.
Having good google skills will save you a lot of time when trying to find answers to
questions that you’re pretty sure others have had. I’m pretty close to believing that
there are no issues that Google can’t find an answer to.
