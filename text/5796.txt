Turning an
investigation into
an explainer
A brief explainer on explainers.

Step one: research

Figure out what visuals
can help others
understand the story.
Find all the diﬀerent types
of formats and angles a
story could take.
If it isn’t the right kind of
visual story, it doesn’t need
to be a video.

What kind of work is each visual doing?
Aesthetic work

Explanatory
work

Step two: production
[[ the part where I can do interviews or shoot any
needed video elements for animation ]]

Step three: writing

I start with a visual outline.
Write a two-column script
with visuals on one side and
narration on the other. Fill
out both sides
simultaneously with all the
cool visuals found in
research.
Read it out loud.

the fun part

First draft: how does it sound?
A good video story should ﬁrst be a good audio
story.
I lay down the narration, the music (if there is
music), and still images or basic drawings as
stand-ins for animation.
This draft is for comprehension.

Second draft: rough animations
Start animating! Using all the visuals in script and
outline as a guide.
Information > decoration.
Less is more. People can only pay attention to one
thing at a time so always guide their eyes.
Time everything to narration.
Minimize text.

Third draft: make it look good
Smooth out all the little visual things.
Tweak music and/or add sound eﬀects.
Have someone who hasn’t ever seen a draft watch
the piece.

Some examples:

A quick note on visual hierarchy:

Tips on distribution...
Use the ﬁrst 5 - 30 seconds to make a statement.

For both YouTube and Facebook: Never underestimate the power of a good,
visual thumbnail.

Fact-checking your animations
and illustrations
- Representations of people need to be accurate (best case
scenario: photos)
- Is the historical representation in the animation accurate?
- Depictions of culture - does it look plausible?
- Science-based depictions → have a scientist fact-check your
work
→ To fact-check your visuals, ﬁnd the most important expert, who
might ﬁnd ﬂaw with your images
