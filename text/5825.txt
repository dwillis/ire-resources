Major Findings
*Dozens of police agencies in America inflate clearance rates for rape through use of something
called “exceptional clearance.”
*Majority of police agencies do not tell FBI if a case was “cleared” by arrest or by exception. It took
100+ records requests, thousands of dollars, a lawsuit, and many hours of haggling to unpack.

*In Baltimore County, police clearance rates went up as they left they
suspects on the streets, including an alleged child predator in Baltimore
County, who was later arrested in Wisconsin for having sex with a new
victim.

underaged

*Uncovered major flaw in FBI’s newest version of Uniform Crime Report,
the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS)
*In cities like Austin, two thirds of “cleared” rape cases in 2016 made police look better, but led to
no arrest.

Document records requests

Talking to real people

Analyzing internal data to
find jurisdictions with
suspicious exceptional
clearance and unfounded
usage and identify
specific cases

Using the case numbers
from the internal data, we
requested police reports
and other documents for
hundreds of cases in a
subset of cities.

We used the documents
to identify specific cases
with repeat offenders or
other elements and
reached out to survivors
to learn about their
experiences.

Bringing the data to life- A case study in Austin

Building trust
*Get off the phone. We made time for face to face meetings with sources despite
the cost of a trip to Austin.
*Network. We asked everyone: Who else knows about this? Who else should we
talk to?

*Find common ground. In this case it was past reports in Texas and a love of the
Boston Red Sox.
*BE HONEST: When we almost lost the interview, in four hours of conversation,
our key message was: you’re right to be nervous. They will likely attack you. Now,
let’s talk in real ways about how that will play out…

Landing the Chief, on camera
*Before asking for an interview, we asked Austin police to check our math.
Their first response was in writing- confirming accuracy.
*For more than a month later, Austin police ignored multiple requests for
an interview. We went up the chain. (sharing initial written
response from police).
*Within days, the interview with the chief was on.

Unraveling Unfounded -- and What You Can
Request Locally
*An “unfounded” crime is one police determine is a “false” or “baseless” report.
*They are removed, or wiped from the agency’s official crime tally.

*The FBI’s older Uniform Crime Report (summary reporting system) forces
agencies to disclose the number of unfounded crimes.
*The FBI’s new UCR (NIBRS) no longer (for now) collects unfounded cases. FBI
has been falsely reporting NIBRS police agencies have “zero” unfounded cases.
FBI is expediting a fix, but not complete yet.
*You have to FOIA locally to get the truth

Transforming “no” to “yes” to receive data...
*M ost cities initially denied our request, or asked for too much money. In Los Angeles

County….

*We routinely pushed back, citing other agencies in the same state-- making sure to tell agencies
about what both larger and smaller entities charged for the same request.

Five + reporters
3+ editors
How to handle it all??

Our goals
A) Helping everyone to the finish line
B) Making sure we stood by the data behind
the story, a process we call “bulletproofing.”
C) Creating an interactive visualization to go
with the story, for our readers.

?

For every dataset we published, there’s a whole
dataset we didn’t publish.
-

-

More than 1 in 3 of the 103 police
jurisdictions we requested data from
provided incomplete data or refused to
provide data.
Data had to be tossed out for all kinds of
reasons — and we rarely had the original
records to check.

-

Late nights sitting “side-by-side”
with Mark and reviewing data.

Dirty data is everywhere — don’t assume you can
include a statistic

Bulletproof != Murderproof
-

-

We’re not here to re-report stories.
Obtaining original documents can be very
expensive.
We’re not auditing the police data.
We’re using our judgement to make sure
we’re correctly interpreting their data.

We’re reporters! We interrogate and
interview the data. Get on the phone!
