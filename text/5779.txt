What's wrong with linear regression?
Regular linear regression assumes each datapoint is independent of each other
What if we have multiple datapoints for each person/school/hospital/location
we're measuring?

Random Intercepts and Slopes

Random Intercepts:
Intercepts: an add-on intercept that differs by each cluster, that will align
with whether a cluster begins above/below the population intercept
i.e., good test-takers will have exam intercepts above the general population
intercept, but their exam scores may change the same as other test-takers
Random Slopes:
Slopes: an add-on slope that will allow each cluster to have their own
variation on the population slope
i.e., some people are more receptive to a drug treatment than others, and
improve more sharply

The

Function

gee stands for Generalized Estimating Equation
Like with the

function, there are several arguments we need to ll in:

Formula:: this is the same formula you would plug in for
Formula

, of the form

id:: this is a variable in your dataframe that identi es your clusters.
id
If I have 12 patients with 3 datapoints each, each datapoint needs to have
something that tells us which patient it is coming from. Usually this is done as
the very rst column of your dataframe, where the id can be a number or a
string.
data:: like with
data

, this is the name of your dataframe

Function

family: the default for this argument is “gaussian”, which just means Normal. We
family:
generally won’t put anything in for this argument unless we’re dealing with binary
data (we’ll see this later).
corstr:: this tells the function how we want to do our weights.
corstr
There are 3 main options for this:
1. “independence”: this is the default and will get us
2. “exchangeable”: this gives us random intercepts
3. “AR-M”: this gives us random slopes and random intercepts. With this though,
we also need to specify a “Mv” argument, which will be 1.

Side note: two other popular functions for modeling longitudinal data are lme()
from the nlme package, and lmer() from the lme4 package. These work
similarly to the gee() function but have slightly different synatx and technically
require stronger statistical assumptions to use. I generally stick to gee().

individual lm()s on the data from each subject separately

If plot on left shows non-overlapping lines: case for random intercepts

Robust Variance

R: Models for Clustered and Correlated Data

Sometimes different clusters/groups will have different variances
Robust variance is a post-model x-em-up to account for different cluster
variances
If the variances really don’t differ by cluster, you’ll get something pretty close
to the regular varaince
If they do differ, then this will help x the variance
Robust variance doesn't perform well when there are fewer than 50 clusters
If you have fewer than 50 clusters, it’s safer to go with the regular variance
because at least we know why it’s wrong
