What is "fracking?"
-

One part of drilling a
well?

-

Everything to do with oil
and gas?

-

Does it matter, if you
and your source are
talking about different
things?

Spills
-

Are they going up or down in your
state?

-

What's getting spilled?

-

Are they getting cleaned up?

-

Are the companies getting fined?

Fines and Enforcement
-

Are fines up or down?

-

Data is hard to find.

-

Was there a fine for that
big spill? Did it get
reduced in the end?

-

Do your state officials
believe in fines? Many
don't?

State regulation
-

Most aspects of oil and gas
are regulated by state
agencies.

-

How many industry
representatives are on your
regulatory commission?

-

Is the agency's mission
protection or promotion?

State agency websites
-

Vary widely in style and
substance

-

Often geared more to
companies than the public

-

Learn your way around before
a big incident

FracFocus.org
-

Industry-supported, industryfunded, but not industry-run

-

Data has been needlessly hard to
access, but getting better.

-

Hobbyist computer expert is making
the data more accessible.

Labor Department Safety Data
-

Census of fatal
occupational injuries,
Bureau of Labor Statistics

-

OSHA Establishment
Search

-

OSHA inspection reports
(FOIA)

SEC Filings
-

10-Ks and 10-Qs (annual and
quarterly reports) from Edgar

-

"Risks" and "Legal
proceedings"

-

Investor calls can be interesting
also (Seeking Alpha)

Sources of data and information on oil and gas drilling:
FracFocus.org
Industry uses this site to disclose the chemicals it uses in hydraulic fracturing. It can be even more useful for volumes of
water used, and precise, lat-long locations of wells. This is not an industry-run site, but it is industry supported and
industry funded.
Fracking data
FracFocus doesn't make its information easily accessible, though things are changing. This is a hobbyist computer expert
who tries to make the information more accessible.
