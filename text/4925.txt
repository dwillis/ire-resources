Laser-like focus on potential harm:

Who is getting hurt by
any of this?

Mark Schoofs, investigations editor at BuzzFeed

● Find the people who have been hurt
● Figure out how to quantify the magnitude of the problem

Our initial reporting question:
Are kids — who don’t usually have money — ever ordered
to pay tickets? What happens if they don’t?
Mark helped us reframe it: are kids going to jail because they
don’t have money? If so, how many?

How to answer that question
● We started with sources — defense attorneys,
advocates, legal scholars.
● Learned that Texas treated truancy as a criminal
offense.
● Advocates said it was possible that kids went to
jail for unpaid truancy fines — but they hadn’t
heard of it happening very often.
