Out of the forest

Organizing your investigation

When to start?
●

On Day 1.

●

Investigations can take several forms: rolling, one-shot, hybrids

●

Sanity = Organization from the start.

●

Failure to organize = missed opportunities, busted deadlines or worse.
○

Retrieve your best material,

○

Plan timing of tasks

○

Organize your writing plan

How will you share?
●

With multiple team members inside your org, you need a seamless
system to share content

●

Even more important with outside collaborations

●

Google Drive. Docs etc. (Not good for external sharing)

●

Trello

●

Ziva’s collaboration Pinterest board (Mom goals)

Do ‘the chron’
●

Start building a timeline from day 1 and link key documents to it.

●

That way you can see patterns in the events and quickly find source
material.

●

Here’s the story

Questions to ask
●

Can you summarize your story in a sentence?

●

Your summary needs focus & a verb
○

“Mortgage lenders in 61 cities are discriminating against people of
color” vs. “redlining in America.”

Questions to ask
●

Who is being harmed? Or is there just potential for harm?

●

Who can you hold accountable?

●

Can you articulate one or more solutions to the problem you’ve
uncovered?

●

Can you point to places doing it better?

stories
