Dealing with blowback

The special problem
of sacred cows

Sometimes it isn’t the horns….

It’s a debate over community belief

It’s not necessarily a legal fight
• You may never get sued, or even be asked for
a correction.
• But change doesn’t happen unless the bearer
of bad news has credibility.
Our credibility matters, not just as a business
proposition but as a social good.

Parkland Memorial Hospital

UT Southwestern Medical Center

They did many great things…
• Parkland is the region’s largest trauma center,
and the last hope for poor, uninsured patients.
• There’s something undeniably noble about the
concept of a public, charity hospital.
• UTSW was an engine of medical research and
economic growth for the region.

The question became…
… could they, or the community, accept the fact
that they’d also done some things they should
not have done, and push for necessary
improvements?

Among our findings
• Faculty at UTSW failed to properly supervise
residents at Parkland.
• Case studies showed basic violations of
patient rights and quality of care, resulting in
preventable injury or death.
• Statistical studies found Parkland to be
mediocre on quality of care measures, and
among the worst performers in the state on
patient safety indicators, for larger hospitals.

Among the results
• State and federal inspectors substantiated allegations
of inadequate care that violated patient rights.
• Medicare officials made Parkland the largest hospital
ever to be put under a form of medical receivership.
• Inspectors issued months of reports substantiating
serious problems at Parkland, and between Parkland
and UTSW.
• The U.S. Department of Justice twice forced Parkland
to settle civil claims of fraudulent Medicare billing due
to inadequate resident supervision or inside dealing.

As for the institutional reaction…
• Administrative shakeup
• A full-on PR offensive
– E-mail blasts to local leaders
– Other assaults on our credibility, sometimes
behind our backs.
– Letters from vendors.
– Attacks in other media, who received large
amounts of advertising money from UTSW.
– Ads in our own paper: “We stand for Parkland”

Jessie Mae Ned loses her leg
The official response
• The story was incomplete.
• Loss of limb is a “recognized
complication” of this
surgery and this was just
one of 47,000 cases that
year.
• It was not typical of care at
Parkland or UTSW.
• Their safety stats are great –
but they can’t share them

Our reply
• Parkland and UTSW did not
comment, despite our sharing a
privacy waiver.
• It was far from the only case of
patient harm at Parkland. The
hospital estimated at least two
cases per day.
• It said important things about
Parkland’s level of care, according
to both federal inspectors and
Parkland itself.
• Their safety stats showed
problems in this area of practice,
and they can share those stats.

Hospital patient safety indicators
The official response
• Our methodology was
wrong.
• We ignored their feedback.
• The statistics are
meaningless.
• UTSW could not replicate
our work.

Our reply
• We used a standard federal
measure, per national experts
and UTSW’s in-house expert.
• We shared results and
methodology in advance and
factored in their feedback.
• The statistics are the only
publicly available measure.
• UTSW’s expert said they were
worthy of note, within bounds
– which we shared.
• Other hospitals did replicate
our results.

Motives matter
• We were accused of bias, ignorance, malice,
prize-mongering, and willfully ignoring key
facts and context.
• We responded factually, about the depth and
care of our reporting.
• We also addressed the question of motive
directly, and sometimes forcefully.

We addressed motives directly
• “We have no financial motive for attacking Parkland or UTSW… before we
started writing these investigative stories, UTSW was a significant
advertiser...
• “We have no personal reason to say bad things about these institutions or
the doctors who work there. Why would we… launch unwarranted attacks
against people who deliver charity care to the poor? …
• “We’ve printed many positive stories about Parkland over the past few
months...
• “There are multiple reasons why our coverage is both important and
appropriate. Parkland is a public institution with a $1.2 billion budget. It is
staffed by doctors, resident doctors in training and medical students, from
UTSW, itself a taxpayer-funded institution. Members of that staff have
told us that patients have been harmed there because of inadequate
faculty supervision.
• “The statistical studies we have seen so far confirm that there have been
some serious problems with patient outcomes at Parkland….

A reminder of what our role is…
“It is a common tactic, in the world of the partisan spin
masters, to assault the legitimacy of one’s opponent…
“But this isn’t a campaign, we aren’t Parkland’s opponent,
and Parkland isn’t a candidate or a breakfast cereal. Mr.
Malaise is working at the expense of local taxpayers,
representing a public trust that is suffering from life-anddeath problems. That’s why Parkland is in virtual federal
receivership. Truthful reporting helped reveal those
problems. Spin will not solve them. We did not sanction
Parkland, the state of Texas did. We merely reported
truthfully and carefully on this most recent enforcement
action.”
