First Day on the Beat:Investigating Education
5 Top Stories to Turn Education Into a Watchdog Beat:
1. FOOD/TRAVEL Board Expenses
While demanding more state aid to educate youngsters in this
impoverished city, Camden school board members in the last year
spent thousands of dollars on themselves: traveling to conferences
around the country, catering their meetings, and occasionally eating
out - all at district expense.

2. CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS
More than 500 Camden school employees _ 10 percent of the
workforce _ have been working without a key piece of information in
their personnel files: criminal background checks.

3. ABSENTEE BOARD MEMBERS
From April through last week, three Camden school board members
missed meetings a total of 39 times. Their absences left the board
unable to reach a quorum at eight sessions _ one fourth of those
scheduled _ to make crucial decisions.

4. SUPERINTENDENT’S CONTRACT
Over the last two years, Camden Schools Superintendent Annette D.
Knox received $17,690 in bonus that the school board did not
approve, or was even aware of.
