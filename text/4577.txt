The Anatomy of an Auto Safety Recall
• Last year in February, General Motors began
recalling 2.6 million cars worldwide for a deadly
ignition defect. That kicked off a record year in
recalls.
• Last year, automakers recalled more than 60
million cars in the United States.
• General Motors recalled almost half of those
vehicles.
• GM, Honda and Chrysler set corporate records.

A note about Takata
• Just weeks ago, Takata, a Japanese airbag
supplier, declared nearly 34 million cars in the
US, made by 10 different automakers,
defective. It marks the largest automotive
recall in history.

Look here first:
• The automaker’s website. Major automakers
put out announcements with basic
information, often before regulators.
• The regulator’s website. Find the defect
notices and chronologies that the automaker
is required to file. http://wwwodi.nhtsa.dot.gov/owners/SearchSafetyIssues

If you have a little more time..
• The regulator’s website (http://wwwodi.nhtsa.dot.gov/owners/SearchSafetyIssues)
also allows you to check..
• Complaints
• Past investigations
• Technical Service Bulletins
• Other recalls on the same models
• Download raw data here: http://wwwodi.nhtsa.dot.gov/downloads/flatfiles.cfm

Early Warning Reports
• Under the Tread Act, automakers are required
to file reports anytime a possible auto safety
defect is blamed for a death or injury. But
VERY LITTLE data is reported.
• http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/ewr/qb/
• Regulators can ask for more information from
automakers in what is called a “death inquiry.”
These are available under FOIA.

Fatalities on US Roads
• All car fatalities on US roads are housed in a
database called Fatality Analysis Reporting
System. http://www.nhtsa.gov/FARS
• Most of the data comes from accident reports
from local police.
• These records can be cross-referenced with
the EWR database, allowing you to pinpoint
gender, age, county, alcohol use, airbag
deployment, etc.

Technical Service Bulletins
• Automakers are not supposed to use TSBs to fix
safety defects, instead of issuing a recall, but
there is evidence that it happens.
• TSB summaries are available on the regulator’s
website: http://wwwodi.nhtsa.dot.gov/owners/SearchSafetyIssues
• You can purchase them

Foreign Recalls
• Under the Tread Act, automakers are required to
report to federal regulators when they recall cars
abroad, but do not recall similar models in the
U.S.
• They must give a reason why. The parts may be
locally-sourced, for example. Or the weather is
different. Or driving habits are better or worse.
