Algorithmic Accountability
How to investigate algorithms that are use in
media, government, or industry?

Editorial Criteria
Boundaries of censorship, differences among search
engines, mistakes?

Search Engines are Complicated!
Are we searching for the things that people
actually search for? Correct input keywords?
Personalization (IP based, or profile based,

Randomization, A/B tests

… not to mention Google doesn’t want people
scraping their results.

Class Activity

Can we induce an artificial surge on campus?
Close the Uber app if it’s running in the
background
Everyone re-start it on my signal, leave it open
But do NOT request a car!

Critical approaches to algorithmic
accountability based on
transparency information?

Challenges
“Proof” is Elusive
Lack of internal knowledge of systems
Interviews are important but can be adversarial

Legal and Regulatory Issues
Terms of Use, EULAs, DMCA, Computer Fraud and Abuse
Act
FOIA: trade secrets, no document creation
1992 Federal Highway Administration case

Ethical Implications
Publication & gaming, individual privacy, deception

Six Stories about Algorithms

2. Mistake that denies a service

3. Censorship
4. Breaks law or social norm

5. False Prediction
6. Violation of privacy

What are consequences of algorithm to public,
or personal interest? Significance? Number of
people affected?
