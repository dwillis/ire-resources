San Diego Background


In October 2007, wildfires in San Diego
County destroyed more than 1,600 homes
and dozens of commercial and agricultural
properties.



Fearing private homeowners slow to clean
up their fire-ravaged homes could lead to
public health issues, the city and county
governments of San Diego stepped in to
offer “free” demolition and debris removal
services.



The governments hired private contractors
to do the work and applied for FEMA
assistance via the California Office of
Emergency Services.



We got a tip contractors were charging
outrageous
o tr geous rates, so
s we decided
ecided to
investigate and analyze the public records
and data to see what was being done with
taxpayer money.

How We Did the Series
The San Diego Union-Tribune filed

numerous requests under the California
Public Records Act. What no one could
provide, reporters researched and built
themselves.


A spreadsheet of demolition permit
applications since the week before the fires
began. Staff enhanced the data, with fields
such as contractor name, after researching
paper files at City of San Diego’s Development
Services Department.
We used this data to determine which
contractors city homeowners had used.
Contractors’ names were helpful in reporting
out

compara le projects.
pr jects. The
he data also was
invaluable in tracking down homeowners who
were displaced.



The city's official list of homes red-, yellow- and
green-tagged after the wildfires to create a
universe of destroyed homes.

Correspondence created from the week of the
fires onward among city/county officials and
contractors. The county turned over nearly
1,300 e-mails and attachments. The city
provided thousands of pages of printed
documents.

E-mails showed the day-to-day workings of
the programs. They also revealed that the
county had tried multiple times to control
media exposure about the project. For
instance, in response to the Union-Tribune's
requests, officials debated whether they
should provide accurate, updated data or the
incomplete, inaccurate records submitted by
contractors.


We obtained handwritten field notes, final
reports and before-and-after photos of select
properties in the program.



Reporters received invoices and weight tickets
from homeowners who retained private
contractors.

To report the city story, we used copies of
certified weight tickets from landfills for
certain properties. We compared these

cit .
Reporters and an intern spent weeks in an
office at the city's Environmental Services
Department examining 17 thick binders filled
with one of the contractor’s records, including
bills of lading, truck logs, spreadsheets and
weight tickets from landfills, recycling centers
and public scales.
We entered the date, address and tonnage of
each truckload into a database, totaled
them, and compared them with invoices for
68 home sites.
Some records had missing, incorrect or
conflicting information, so reporters worked
with editors to develop a methodology that
gave the contractor the benefit of the doubt.
Reporters supplemented their review of
documents by interviewing city, state and
federal officials, homeowners and industry
experts.

The data analysis for the county story
involved importing invoice records into a
database and joining them with not only the
county's
cou ty's list of damaged homes
home but also
county assessor and San Diego Geographic
Information Source (SANGIS) property data.

Reporters used GIS mapping to analyze the
geographic distribution of program
participants.
We also used mapping
apping to show us if any of
the program participants were outside of the
burn area, showing possible fraud.
