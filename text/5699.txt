Why does digital
security matter?

OK, but what the heck
are we even securing –
and what from?

Threat
Modeling

●

Enumerating the risks involved
for a user or business, and ways
to mitigate those risks

●

Threat modeling allows you to
identify your: assets, adversaries,
risks, and practices.

●

Threat
Modeling

●
●
●

Asset: What data do you have to
protect?
Adversary: Who wants to get a
hold of that data?
Risk: What is the likelihood of
that happening?
Practice: How far are you willing
to go to make sure that doesn’t
happen?

There are many ways to threat model
and break down your risks

Threat
Modeling

●
●
●
●

Technical: hacking, interception,
encryption
Legal: legal protections, lawsuits,
subpoenas, etc
Social: phishing, social
engineering, exploiting trust
Physical: theft, network taps,
torture, physical harm

A simpliﬁed view of digital assets
Data-at-rest:
●
●

What's on your computer?
What's sitting in your e-mail
archive?

Data-in-transit:
●
●

Communication!
Calls, messages, ﬁles sent; anything
out of your hands.

Identity:
●
●

Your logins and how you get into
things!
Your online presence!

Securing
Data-at-rest

●

File deletion

●

●

When you delete a ﬁle from your
computer, you’re only deleting it
from the “table of contents” of
your drive.
Data still there until something
else needs to use those unused
“pages.”
A “secure” delete writes random
data into the place where the ﬁle
was.

●

Erasing ﬁles:
○

Secure deletion

○

●

Secure Empty Trash” on Mac: hold
⌘ key when right-clicking Trash.
CCleaner (Windows)

Erasing free space (to wipe ﬁles
that you didn’t erase securely):
○
○

Disk Utility (Mac)
CCleaner (Windows)

File encryption

●
●

Protects ﬁles
Use case: sending sensitive ﬁles
or putting ﬁles on USB sticks to
share.
○
○

VeraCrypt (multiplatform)
MiniLock (multiplatform)

Full Disk
Encryption

●

Desktop
○
○

●

Mac: FileVault
PC: BitLocker

Mobile
○
○

iPhone: Default
Android: Check your privacy and
security settings!

Software
updates

●

●

Security holes in Windows, Mac,
and Linux, are discovered on a
near-daily basis.
Same with browsers and most
other software. (When it annoys
you to restart & update, just do
it!)

Passwords
Strong, two-factor authentication

information lives online

Passwords

An 8 letter password with
numbers and symbols can be
cracked in a few days, but an 8
word phrase could take
centuries.

Passwords
Passphrases

Phrase vs. word

●

Use a sentence instead of a word!
Use something long and memorable
instead of something completely
incomprehensible!

End-to-End
encryption

●
●

It's like an impenetrable
envelope!
Service providers in the middle
can't read your communications
But there's still metadata

Metadata

●
●

Metadata exists to allow a system
to work
How else does the post oﬃce (or
Signal, or your ISP) know where
to move your message or data?

Source: Digital Security for Journalists, Susan McGregor

How do you hide
that metadata?

Imagine sending an envelope inside
another envelope.
The ﬁrst recipient opens up the
envelope and sees instructions to
drop the second envelope in the mail
from where they're at.

Relay your online traﬃc
●

Virtual Private
Networks (VPNs)

Website doesn't know your about
your real internet connection.
○

●
●

Sometimes you don't want a website
that someone from ProPublica is
poking around.

Your ISP doesn't know what
websites you're going to, either.
If you're on a passwordless
wireless network, it also protects
your traﬃc.

Virtual
Private Network

●

Not all VPNs are created equal!

●

Data retention
Open source, reputable protocol
Option for “kill switch”

Avoid free VPNs — your traﬃc is
what they’re selling!

Tor

●
●

Anonymized internet access so
websites can’t identify or locate you
Great for research so websites don’t
know you visited them & your ISP
doesn’t know either

https://www.torproject.org

●

Tor

Caveats:
○ Slow
○ Be careful with logins!
Relays see your traﬃc unless
it's HTTPS — but they don't
see where your traﬃc is
coming from
○ Depending on the use case
and threat model, Tor traﬃc
might get you ﬂagged

●

Browser plugins

●

Ublock Origin – Not just for ad
blocking! You can prevent your
browser from communicating
with malware sites.
HTTPS Everywhere – If a
website has an encrypted
version, automatically use that
instead!

Communicating with others

Signal (iOS & Android)
WhatsApp (iOS & Android)

Text messaging

●

iMessage (iOS)
○ Apple sees metadata
○

●

Same encryption as Signal
Facebook owns WhatsApp, so nobody
knows what they do with your metadata.
But having the app installed might be less
"shady" for some sources

We have to trust Apple on the encryption
system they've implemented

All of these also move the metadata
from your phone provider to these
service providers.
○

i.e. AT&T knows who I text, but not who
I Signal

●

Signal (iOS & Android)
○

●

Calls

Jitsi Meet (PC/Mac)
○
○

●

Voice & video calls on your phone
Video conference calls, like Google
Hangout or Skype.
In your web browser.

FaceTime (iOS):
○

Same properties as iMessage.

Jitsi (secure VOIP on desktop)

Other tools & circumstances

●
●

PGP

●

De-facto standard for e-mail
encryption.
The software is notoriously hard
to use and easy to mess up.
Services like Signal handle the
encryption keys. PGP requires
you to have a copy of your key &
your contact's key.

If someone else gets your key, they
can retroactively decrypt anything
you encrypted.

PGP

Services like Signal use encryption
with "forward-secrecy" (all messages
get a unique key, based on your key
and the recipient's key), so an
encryption break won't break your
previous communication.

●
●

Ricochet

●

●

Experimental chat software for
PC and Mac.
Uses Tor, connects directly to
your recipient via "the dark web"
Decentralized! No registration,
nobody gets your metadata
except you and your contact.
(But: software hasn't been
updated since 2016.)

Sunder

Take a passphrase, use the app to
split it up into a few chunks (like,
6).
Tell the app that 4 out of 6 chunks
can recover the passphrase.
To reverse it, use the app and feed
in the split-up chunks

Only supports Mac and Linux
right now

Things can and will
go south

Human error is real!

●

You will make mistakes
Your sources will make mistakes
Your coworkers will make mistakes

And: humans built these security
tools, too!

They sometimes make mistakes

How long does your information
need to be secure?

Threat
Modeling

Is it OK if metadata gets out? Is it OK
if someone knows a source is talking
to you as long as the communication
is conﬁdental?

We like keeping ﬁles forever! But do
you need to keep your information
forever?

I’m not named in the lawsuit, nor was I deposed as a witness. But I did
make jokes that involved Hogan in one way or another in our internal
chat at the time. And now the whole world knows how corny I am.

[...] Someone referred to the Hulk Hogan sex tape as “tender.” I
wondered aloud if it also contained a leg drop (a famous pro-wrestling
move) — a “tender leg drop.”

"...Signal does oﬀer robust
end-to-end encryption, which
ensures that only the people
involved in a chat can see the
messages [...] they could have
theoretically seized a phone
belonging to Wolfe or one of the
reporters and simply read the
messages on the app."

Subpoenas, cloud storage -- is your
e-mail / dropbox / etc provider a risk for
getting subpoenaed without your org
knowing about it?

Final thoughts

Limited rights at borders; not
possessing data or having it protected so
even you can't open it before you get to
your destination may be helpful. (See:
Sunder)

Maybe try Google Voice! In addition to
spam & harrassment, using your real #
can be a risk when used for two-factor
& if your cell provider is careless. (Ask
to set up "port protection" or "PIN
protection" on your account.)

Final thoughts

It takes two! The tools are useless if
your coworkers or sources can't use
them or refuse to use them.
Security is a spectrum. Nothing is
"perfect" (& things are rarely completely
broken). Threat modeling > Tools.
