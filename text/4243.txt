CONCEIVING THE STORY

Finding great ideas:
• Pay attention to beat reporters.
• Ask: How often does that happen?
• Create daily/weekly/monthly habits.
• Read and emulate others.
#IRE14

@Cormier_HT

CONCEIVING THE STORY
Identifying and obtaining data:
• Read the law – not just the stuff for FOIA.
• Fight back. Seek the IT people.
• Follow the regulators. Get what they’re
getting.
• Trust the Basics: Nexis, OIG, GAO,
academia/government studies.
• Use IRE and NICAR!

@Cormier_HT

CONCEIVING THE STORY
Choosing and building the team:
• Assign the story:
• Time peg?
• Build the team: Story editor + reporter + lead
producer
• If bigger scope, + more researchers or
reporters?
• Will the data need to be fact-checked? Copy
edited?
• If there's video/audio or rich media content,
video producer?
#IRE14

@jaeahjlee

CONCEIVING THE STORY
Special considerations for small newsrooms:
• Everyone's a data reporter.
• Ask these questions early: What’s the story?
Source, age, reliability, time scope? Do we
need to talk to an expert?
• No data hand-offs.
• Google Drive and Spreadsheets are our
friends.
• Empowering the newsroom with Skillz
trainings.

THE REPORTING PHASE
Organizing the reporting/Make a game plan:
• Who's collecting what data?
• Who's calling for comment?
• Who's drafting the text? Who's writing what?
• Who will keep the ball rolling? Assign a lead
producer.
• Don't fall into the traps of an evergreen
timeline. Set benchmark goals.

@jaeahjlee

THE REPORTING PHASE

Organizing the data analysis:
• Identify the records needed.
• Take stock of your competitive situation.
• Over estimate the time you think the analysis
will take.
• Once you are farther into the data, run the
analysis like it was the final one for
publication.
• Be as obsessive with the data and the
interactive fact checking as you are with
reporting.

@robodellaz

THE REPORTING PHASE

Juggling data work with shoe leather:
• Identify choke points in the reporting and
data.
• Think about the best allocation of resources.
• Start writing something as soon as your story
is beginning to take shape.
• Let the data inform the reporting and vice
versa.
• Create a timeline for both the reporting and
analysis and try to stick to it.
#IRE14

@robodellaz

THE REPORTING PHASE
Keeping on track/managing the bosses:
• Be careful about sharing analysis too
early.
• Still, don’t hoard information.
• Use a backout schedule.
• Build in some go/no go deadlines.
• Share a “lessons learned” memo after
publication.
#IRE14

@shawnmcintosh

THE REPORTING PHASE
Visualizing the data/Interrogate the project:
• What’s the story we’re trying to tell here?
• Do we care about shareability?
• Is this story best told through a static or
interactive presentation?
• Is this a project we’ll want to opensource?
#IRE14

@jaeahjlee

BRINGING IT HOME
Framing the story and preparing to write:
• Be rigorous about the frame, is every part
necessary and nailed?
• Consider scope, impact.
• No waffling – prove your case.
• Embrace the gray.
• Identify culprits clearly.
• Tell readers what you don’t know.
#IRE14

BRINGING IT HOME
The drafting/editing process:
• Settle your themes – and don’t forget
them.
• Outline, outline, outline.
• Clear, concise language. Kill “-ly” adverbs.
• Don’t forget the humans.

#IRE14

@Cormier_HT

BRINGING IT HOME
Bullet-proofing to reduce legal risk:
• Do not wait to “confront” subjects .
• Consider an “FYI” to key subjects along
the way.
• Consider registered letters or emails to
verify data.
• Consider read-backs of key portions of
your story to key sources.
• Develop a system for legal review.
#IRE14

@shawnmcintosh

BRINGING IT HOME
No errors – the fact-checking process:
• Source all your data.
• Don't let fact-checking be an
afterthought.
• Expect fact-check errors and build in time
to address them.
• Don’t have a fact-checker? Try a
colleague.
#IRE14

@jaeahjlee

BRINGING IT HOME
Stress-testing your data
for final publication:
• You want to be the one
taking the harshest look
at your data.
• Think about how your
most unreasonable critics
would react.
• Think about every
possible limitation of your
data.
• Take a day a week of
publication just to spend
with your data.
#IRE14

@robodellaz

BRINGING IT HOME
The final gauntlet to
publishing:
• Not making errors is all mindset.
• Fact check the data and interactives as
much as story.
• Everyone will have their hands on the
story, make sure yours are the last
ones.
• Print out copies to check all facts and
#’s.
• You may feel like this guy, but its
better to feel like him before story
#IRE14publishes, not after.
