Why “No” Can Be the Right Word

Common Problems with Pitches
• Overly broad
• Overdone—not fresh
• A “noun” project
• Too small in scope/potential impact
• Too difficult to quantify (data don’t exist/flawed)
• Too complicated (can’t be summarized in 1-2
sentences)
• Simply won’t fly in your newsroom
• Not enough homework to back up the premise
• Asks a question you won’t be able to answer

• How long will this take? What will we expend in resources?
• Is this the best time to do this investigation?
• Consider testing a thesis before going all in (ex: Is it true for
one city before we do the whole state or country?)
• Consider publishing faster, and in pieces
• Rule of Thumb: the longer it takes, the bigger the payoff has
to be
• What is the minimum story we will get, even if we don’t hit a
home run? How will we know when to cut bait?

Sample Pitch Form
• In six words or less, what is your story?
• In one sentence:
–What question is your story trying to answer?
–Why will this story resonate with our audience?
–How will this story hold someone accountable?
•Does this story have potential to drive change?
–How would you tell this story?
•What media would you use?
–What else has been done on this topic?
•How is your angle different or fresh?

In Greater Depth

story will reveal
• What are the potential main characters and scenes?
• What documents/data/audio have you already
gathered?
• Who else has covered this? (Provide links)
