Find out what exists
 Read news accounts, GAO reports,

Inspector General audits, academic work,
previous reporting, charts, other studies.
 Keep a careful eye for the sources of
information so you can target request.
 Look at blank agency forms to know what
information is collected.
 Comb website. Know what exists online is
likely not the entire dataset.
 Get the record layout. Know which fields
exist.

Do you need to FOIA?
 Can information just as on point be

obtained through other sources?
 Can you scrape the site to get what you
need?
 Has someone else already FOIAed what
you need?
 Call the agency. The background you
developed has already helped you
negotiate.

Follow the data trail
 More than one agency may keep the data

you want.
 For instance, a traffic accident may be
documented by local police. And by your
state Department of Transportation. If it’s
a fatal accident, it should be standardized
and reported to the US DOT for FARS.
Same with crime
 Local, state, federal, international levels.
 If one gives you a hard time, another
agency may prove less difficult.

Triangulate
 Is there a parallel set of documents that

can help you get what you need?
 Say your focus is serious medical events
at a hospital. Or innocent bystander
shootings by police. You want a hospital’s
sentinel events. Or police gun discharge
logs.
 Hard to get? What about city payment
records? Lawsuits? City law department’s
lawsuit and settlement tracking.
Academics?

What do you need?
What will you settle for?
 Is a database’s field a sticking point? Can

be redacted? Do you really need it?
 Work around privacy issues. Suggest
alternatives

– Ask for unique identifiers if names are a
sticking point and you don’t really need
names. Sometime IDs if they contain private
data can be reassigned to other digits.
– Work with the agency. They may not release
birth dates, but they might calculate an age
or tabulate other information.

Crafting the request
 Ask for media expediting.
 Ask what can speed your request like

redacting what you
 Find out what records have already been
released. Check FOIA logs. Talk with the
FOIA officer.
 Ask for fee waivers.
 Ask for the appeals process in writing

Crafting the request (nerdy)
 Request data in its original electronic

format. Specify other acceptable file
formats. CSV or other delimited files
should be standard.
 Time requests to an agency's reporting
cycles. Might be cheaper and easier.
 Available via Google website indexing?
Government ftp sites contain data cache
to help google searching.

Understand the law
 Become familiar with federal and state law

and precedent. Talk with your counsel.
 The Reporters Committee for Freedom of
the Press (rcfp.org) offers great resources.
Helpful for knowing what is public in other
states.
 Along with federal and state laws,
sometimes local governments may have
their own open records law.

Negotiating
 Get someone on the phone to discuss your

request before you file. Call to track your
request. If you get denied, get someone
on the phone to explain what is
releasable.
 Target your request to get what you
believe should be public. Sometimes the
best strategy is to focus. Other times that
proves too hard and adds costs.
 Be persistent. They hope you go away.

Talk Tech
 Talk tech. What does “calculate” mean?

What kind of “programming”? Ask what
software and languages they use. Suggest
efficient and cheaper methods.
 Offer to do the work yourself. If an
agency says it needs to use SQL to join
tables, say you can do it.

Argue Fees

 Have agencies itemize time and work.
 Can you modify the request? If certain

fields are expensive, can you do without?
 If you must pay, get everything in writing.
 If possible, negotiate future requests. If
the database won’t change, how much will
it cost next year?
 Can you get a copy of queries? You don’t
want an agency to say the staffer who
pulled the data is gone, so you need to
pay all over again for the new person to
start from scratch.

Argue Denials
 “No report containing the information you

requested exists.” Records exist regardless
of whether an agency has already
compiled them. You may need to ask if
the agency destroyed the records.
 “No records exist.” Maybe you need to
rephrase your request.
 “We don't have to create a new record for
you.” Writing queries to extract records is
not creating a new record.

Before the Appeal
 Cite legal decisions. There may be court

decisions or attorney general opinions in
your favor. In California, the First
Amendment Coalition's Ask & Answered
section is a great resource. Other states
have similar resources.
 If you’ve done all you can, having your
newsroom’s attorney call or write the
agency’s counsel may compel a response.
But doing so also escalates matters.
