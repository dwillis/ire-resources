How we got here
The evolution of the ACS

Introduction of
rolling sample
design concept
in context of
Census Bureau

First data
Congress renewed
released for
interest in a continuous
nation and
measurement
areas
First operational
alternative to the long
250,000+
test conducted
form sample
in 4 sites
Test sites in 36
counties in 26
states

Congress
Office that
authorized a mid- evolved into the
decade census
ACS established
but did not
appropriate funds

Testing basic
methods and
procedures

Expanded to full
sample in all
counties in 50
states, DC & PR

Demonstrating

feasibility and
survey quality

ACS Basics
ACS is collected
– Year-round
– Every year
– Everywhere

3

ACS Basics
• The ACS is a survey, not a 100% census
– About 2.5 % of population each year
– About 3.5 million addresses
• Sample was just increased this month (from 3
million) to keep up w/growing population

• The ACS covers characteristics – don’t try
to use for pop counts
4

ACS Basics
Topics include:
• Income
• Labor force status
• Citizenship
• Language spoken
• Educational attainment
• Rent
• Home value
• Commute to work
• Disability status
• Marital history

• Place of birth
• Year of entry
• Race
• Hispanic origin
• Ancestry
• Relationship
• Health Insurance
• Utilities / mortgage
• Age of home
• Occupation
• Residence 1 year ago

…!and!more!

5

ACS Basics
• ACS pools data collected over the 1-, 3and 5-year periods to produce estimates
for increasingly smaller geographic areas

Use Multiyear Estimates When …
• It’s the only data available
• One or more of the geos you’re comparing
don’t receive 1-year estimates
• Margins of error for 1-year estimates are
larger than required
• Analyzing data for small population groups
14

General Principle:
Currency vs. Reliability

Margins of Error
• Every survey has a margin of error associated
with it
• So did the Census 2000 “Long Form”
– Wasn’t calculated
– But we provide the formula in the technical
documentation

• ACS MoE higher, but data more current
• ACS design is a tradeoff – costs / burden vs.
producing necessary data
16

Margins of Error: Data Quality
• Sampling Error: Uncertainty because the data are
gathered from a sample of the population
• Nonsampling Error: Error from respondents not
answering questions, giving incorrect answers,
etc.
• ACS has higher sampling error but lower
nonsampling error than Census 2000 long-form
17

17

Margins of Error and Data Filtering
• For the 1-year and 3-year data, some tables are
filtered for data quality reasons
• For the 5-year data, all estimates are published,
regardless of margin of error
• Allows you to use smaller geographies as building
blocks

Apply the formula:

New Margin of Error = 285
(Less than the sum of MoE’s)
