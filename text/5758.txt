Which chart should I use,
and why?
bit.ly/nicar19-charts

Why should we care
about data visualization
and chart literacy?

Humans are visual
We can make stronger comparisons and
better understand patterns when we can
actually see them!

A picture is worth 1,000 words
● Data visualization can be used to tell stories in the
same way a text story or photo story can convey
information
● It’s important to think of charts and graphics as a
storytelling tool rather than a fun add-on to a story

Knowing when to use charts
is just as important as
knowing how to use charts.

What kinds of data are we
talking about?
When we talk about data we aren’t talking about just
numbers and statistics – it’s information of any kind.
Understanding the type of data you’re working with will
help you decide how to visualize it!

Considering diﬀerent types of data:
Qualitative
Things that you can observe, but not measure

Quantitative
Numerical data...things that can be measured and counted

QUALITATIVE:
A list of types of girl scout cookies

Tagalongs

Do-si-dos

Samoas

Savannah
Smiles

S’mores

Thin Mints

Toffe-tastic

Trefoils

QUANTITATIVE:
The number of Samoas in the box

10

Diﬀerent ways we can dissect our data
● Cross-sectional: Snapshot of variables at a single
point in time
○

Ex: The number of cookies in each box in a collection of boxes

● Longitudinal: Variables measured repeatedly over a
period of time
○

Ex: The total number of cookies eaten from the box each day

Data relationships
Understanding the relationships
represented in your data will help you
ﬁgure out how to visualize it.

ALWAYS ASK YOURSELF:

What is the point?
What data relationships am I
trying to show here?

Aggregated
v.
Raw data
Or at least… rawer

Fox News - Family unit apprehensions at southern border up 300 percent since
ﬁscal year 2018: CBP (Mar. 06, 2019)

NYT - Border at ‘Breaking Point’ as More than 76,000 Unauthorized Migrants Cross in a Month (3/6/19)

Get.
That.
Data.

Behind every ﬁgure in a press release or a new report:
● Hundreds of line-item payments
○ From Party X to Party Y, for Service Z on Date A
● Thousands of patient records
○ Admitted with Symptoms ABC, receiving Treatment XYZ
● Millions of sensor readings!

Using state and district personnel records, Times reporters compared
teachers hired by the ﬁve resegregated schools with those hired at schools
in wealthier, whiter neighborhoods.
They found teachers in the whiter schools are more experienced, more
likely to stay in their jobs and more likely to have clean employment
records.
Teachers in the mostly black schools are less experienced, more likely to
quit and more likely to have been ﬂagged for incompetence or
misconduct.

Why bother?

Distributions reveal more than averages

Relationships tell a story

You can get… creative

Look for records that
● Are granular, not aggregated from other
records
○ “Fundamental particles”
● Have unique identiﬁers

Ask for these records.
KEEP ASKING!
You will get them.

Maps

In order to make a map, your data will need some
type of geographic component, most likely:
● coordinates (lat, long)
● data mapped to a geographic boundary, e.g.
census block, ZCTA, county, state, etc.

If you’re trying to ﬁnd a way to combine the data
you have with location data in order to make a
map, a map probably isn’t the best way to visualize
your data.

Why maps are great
●
●
●
●

Cater to the user
Establishing a sense of place
Displaying trends and results
When location is the most critical visualization element

Cater to the user
Maps can be a great way to provide the user with information that is directly
applicable to them.
● Fire maps -> how close are you to the active ﬁre?
● How did your district (or census block) vote?
● What ISPs can you get?

Establishing sense of place
●
●

Locator maps
Providing context for where you are

Displaying trends and results
●
●

Election maps
Choropleth maps

Location is critical
●
●

Finding places
Navigation/directions

Why maps are sometimes not great
●
●

●

When it ends up just being a population map
When points don’t mean anything
○ E.g. lots of points on a map that all look the same and only have details on
demand
■ No legend, color, or size
Location is an aspect, but not the most critical - just because it can be a map
doesn’t mean that it should be a map

When it’s really just a population map

When points are
meaningless

Location is
an aspect
But not the most
critical

Tips/strategies
Ideas for driving the point home

Walk your audience through it
●
●

They will see what you want them to see ﬁrst
Especially helpful if the chart or topic is complicated

The Pudding

The New York Times

Add annotations
●
●

Point to key pieces of information in the chart
Add context

FiveThirtyEight

Consider using small multiples
●

Scanning and comparing quickly

Keep it simple
and use the space
you have.

The Washington Post

Or maybe
it shouldn’t be
a chart at all!
