Our Common Enemy

complex

Moment Driven Stories

 Facts work but only when they enhance your

theme

TV’s Golden Rule

What Makes a
Story Work?
The 3 C’s
-- Conflict

-- Character
-- Consistency of
Theme

Maximize the Moment
 Build to moment. Moments without context lack

oomph

 Get out of the way. Less track and silence can

be effective

 Build in “Applause Line” (LET IT SOAK IN)

 Wireless mics = better, more real moments
 Make me care

Why moments
flop
-- Can’t understand
video/audio

-- Lack proper
context
-- Poor editing
