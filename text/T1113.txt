International data – How and where to find them
Copenhagen, May 3, 2003
WEB TOOLS
Way Back Machine
If you are searching sensitive data that were removed (i.e. US government’s removal that
followed Sept.11 attack), try to get them through the Way Back Machine, a Web Archive
that collects older versions of Web sites around the world.
http://web.archive.org
Convert format
If you find your data in PDF format and want to analyse them with a spreadsheet or a
database manager, convert your data by e-mailing the PDF file to pdf2txt@adobe.com or
by getting the file through Google, which always offers an HTML version of PDF
documents.
Google Toolbar
If you are searching very popular data in a big Web site and get lost, try to exploit the
“Internet collective wisdom” by searching the site with Google, which ranks first Web
pages that are linked the most by other sites.
