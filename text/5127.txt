June 2017

The Three Types of Interviews

The Basic
Rules
for Good
Interviews

ACCOUNTABILITY

How guilty did you feel that you were drunk
at the wheel in the crash that killed her?

EMOTION

What did her loss mean to you?

INFORMATION
When did you first learn your daughter
was killed in the car accident?

1. ASK OPEN-ENDED
NOT CLOSED QUESTIONS:

You get the answers you deserve
• Don’t blame the
interviewee
• Ask a stupid question,
you get a stupid answer
So how can we ask smarter questions?

THE KID WHO NEARLY DIED FROM E COLI

• ASK - WHAT, WHO?
HOW?
WHY?
WHEN?
• AVOID
YES/NO ANSWERS

2. DON'T GIVE PEOPLE
EASY ESCAPE ROUTES:

• AVOID THE DOUBLE-BARRELLED QUESTION
• OTHER WAYS TO LET THEM OFF THE HOOK:
• DIRECT WAY OUT – TWO CHOICES
• UNNEEDED ADJECTIVE OR PHRASE
• UNNEEDED FACT

The Investigative Interview - Julian Sher

Why won’t Obama arm Syrian rebels?
We’ll never know with this question that gives him an
escape… by adding just seven unnecessary words at the end

The Firing of Comey -- Letting Spicer off the hook:
How many questions do you need?

Since you were involved in this Tuesday night as well -- giving a blanket answer,
saying at the time ‘It was all him’ regarding deputy AG Rod Rosenstein ….
1/ Why did you come out with information that was later contradicted by the
President two days later ?
2/ … Could you explain the tick-tock?
3/ …When were you brought in?
4/ … Who else was involved?
5/ … Why were the American people given incorrect information that night?

3. BASIC IS BEAUTIFUL - KEEP IT
CLEAN AND SIMPLE
AVOID LOADED OR
CONTROVERSIAL
WORDS…

June 2017

The Firing of James Comey –
Letting Spicer off the hook:

When a question mark comes out of
your mouth…

• STOP TALKING!!!!

Mr. Mayor – have you
not become the most
hated and corrupt
politician in town?
Isn’t that what all
climate change
deniers say?
Are you doing enough
to stop radical Islam
in your mosque?

A BABY IS KILLED IN A “GANG SHOOTING”

June 2017

4. THE WORST QUESTION IS NOT
ASKING ONE
• AVOID MAKING STATEMENTS, OPINIONS
OR GETTING INTO A DEBATE*

*UNLESS IT’S PART OF A WELL-PLANNED STRATEGY

60 Minutes debates “fake news”

Charlie Rose never lets Obama answer

STATEMENTS CAN ALSO KILL
THE PACE OF AN INTERVIEW

5. LISTEN, LISTEN, LISTEN
• GRAB THEIR WORDS,
MAKE THEM YOURS AND
THROW THEM BACK
• SHIFT THE WEIGHT BACK
TO THE SUBJECT
• AND DON’T SOUND LIKE
YOU’RE NOT PAYING
ATTENTION…

5. LISTEN, LISTEN, LISTEN

June 2017

A senator tries to defend Trump’s racism

• LISTEN TO WHAT THEY
ARE REALLY SAYING

The ‘WTF” moment … or “Huh? Can You Say That in English, Please?”

RECAP: Five Basic Rules of Interviews
• 1. ASK OPEN-ENDED NOT
CLOSED QUESTIONS
• 2. DON'T GIVE PEOPLE ANY
EASY ESCAPE ROUTES
• 3. BASIC IS BEAUTIFUL - KEEP IT
CLEAN AND SIMPLE.
• 4. THE WORST QUESTION IS
NOT ASKING ONE
• 5. LISTEN, LISTEN, LISTEN

ONCE YOU KNOW THE RULES, KNOW
WHEN AND HOW TO BREAK THEM

(c) www.juliansher.com

DON’T ASK YES/NO QUESTIONS…
EXCEPT WHEN YOU WANT TO
FORCING A YES/NO ANSWER

DON’T USE TRIGGER WORDS… EXCEPT
T0 FORCE A CERTAIN ANSWER

June 2017

A once “bad mother” ….
and the thin line between “neglect and abuse”

o EITHER/OR
(“Were you corrupt
or just stupid?”)
o MASSAGING THE ANSWER
(“That’s not what you said
on the phone. You told us…
o REPEATING QUOTES
(“You once said you can act like
‘an idiot.’ How have you
been “an idiot” in this case?)
DELIBERATELY USING TRIGGER WORDS
(Here is an example of a once “bad mother” ….
and the thin line between “neglect and abuse”

#4: DON’T MAKE STATEMENTS… EXCEPT WHEN
THE CAREFULLY-CRAFTED STATEMENT WORKS:

WHAT TO DO :
WHEN THE INTERVIEW TURNS
INTO AN ARGUMENT

(c) www.juliansher.com

#5: WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU GET INTO
TROUBLE
Because face it - you are going to lose
more than you will win…

An extreme example: Anderson Cooper cuts short the interview

When the interviewee subject starts questioning the interview…and the interviewer
BILL O’REILLY VS. TERRY GROSS

WHAT TO DO :
… WHEN THE SUBJECT REFUSES
TO ANSWER THE DARN QUESTION!

Keep asking the SAME question:
Katie Couric pushes Palin on what papers she reads
