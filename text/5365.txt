among investigative journalists

1. Broaden your network: You will not be able to identify or recruit
diverse talent unless you are truly connected with diverse people.
2. Use internships as strategic tools: Try adding an intern to your
investigative team. Go to unorthodox places, such as coding boot
camps, to identify prospective candidates.
3. Redefine what it means to be an ‘investigative reporter’: Great
web producers and data journalists don’t always have traditional
reporting skills or follow traditional journalism career paths.
4. Use temporary assignments to groom internal talent: Everyone
goes on vacation, right? Assign diverse journalists to work with top
investigators for short periods.
5. Grant ownership of ideas and provide support: Surround aspiring
investigative reporters who have great ideas with the talent and
expertise to bring their ideas to fruition.
6. Raise investigative expectations among your team: Require all
staff to utilize investigative techniques in their day-to-day reporting.
7. Use learners as teachers: Send diverse staff to professional
conferences, but require them to teach their colleagues what they
learned upon their return.
8. Take advantage of fellowships and programs designed to grow
investigative talent: Efforts such as the Ida B. Wells and O’Brien
fellowships are intended to develop future investigative journalists.
9. Make a firm commitment: This is a marathon, not a sprint. A firm
commitment to diversifying your team will make the time and effort
worth it.
10. Pay it forward: Don’t keep your hot prospects to yourself. If you
don’t have an opening, point the candidate to someone who does.
