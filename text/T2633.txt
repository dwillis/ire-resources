Here are a few useful Internet sites that can help reporters get
information about doctors and their histories of medical malpractice
claims or other problems.
http://www.docboard.org/docfinder.html
This site gives access to many state medical board sites and is good for
checking doctors licensed in multiple states. States vary greatly in the
amount of malpractice and disciplinary records they post on doctor
"profiles."
http://webapps.ama-assn.org/doctorfinder/home.html
This site operated by the American Medical also can help you track down
a doctor but it has added so many hoops that it's a hassle to use unless
all else fails
http://www.fsmb.org/
Federation of State Medical Boards contains a decent number of reports
about "model" operations for state boards that regulate doctors. It also
has links to state licensing boards which can be searched to find
disciplinary actions against a doctor or information about their
education and other credentials.
http://www.npdb-hipdb.com/
National Practitioner Data Bank. This federal government site is
supposed to have all medical malpractice cases and disciplinary actions
against doctors, but cases aren't reported and in any case it doesn't
name any of the doctors.
http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov
At this site, you can search doctors and other health care professionals
kicked out of Medicare and Medicaid for wrongdoing. It includes
information on the length of the "exclusion" and the reasons for it.
http://defaulteddocs.dhhs.gov/search.asp HHS Health Resources and
Services Administration lists $166,710,667 in student loan defaults by
doctors, from chiropractors to veterinarians. Can search by name.
http://hippo.findlaw.com/hippohome.html Hippo is a chatty site that has
good links to a wide variety of health care policy information.
