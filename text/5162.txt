A few points before we begin:
-Don’t think your post will tip off the competition. Fight for those who are buried in their phones
or are on other programming.
-There will always be a need for journalism, storytelling, and investigations. The WAY you tell
your stories changes. (print, radio, tv, internet)
-Find yourself. Authenticity is the most important online.
-Consider branding skills. This will help viewers understand you. (Brand is another way I’m
saying “highlighting your best side.” Again, authenticity is most important)
-Airing a story isn’t enough anymore. We have to sometimes think like marketers. If people
don’t watch our work, how will we really make an impact?
-Most important tip: ENGAGE and respond to viewers who take time to comment. Tag them in
the response.

BEFORE STARTING AN INVESTIGATION:
FB Live Chat with audience. Let them know what you’re working on a broad scale and ASK for
what they’d like to know. (We call it “Defenders in Progress” series)
-Cartels in Austin – We brought the viewer into the story before we knew anything and asked
what they’d like to know. We used their questions in our interview and did a special section on
the website story dedicated to us asking “viewer questions.”

end of year (https://www.facebook.com/KVUEinsider/videos/10155057196156178/) – we
reached out to talk with viewers about what we’ve done and what they would like to see. This
was one story suggested. http://www.kvue.com/news/investigations/defenders/state-road-willnot-get-improvements-amid-complaints/380766725

GOING LIVE HACKS
-

Use your “insights” page to see when the majority of your fans are online
Invite the audience to participate in the discussion off the start. Start easy by asking
“where are you from?” or “Can you hear me?”
Repeat what you’re doing… every few minutes
Use the viewer’s name
Put the phone on a tripod or prop it up
Ask the station to “share” your live stream the moment you go live (tagging them helps)
If using a station account, look AND sound as professional as possible (use lights,
microphone, and if possible not your phone’s camera)
After the stream ends, go to the post and “like” and/or “comment” to each person who
commented

*Remember: people’s BS meters are strong. Don’t try to be someone with all of the answers if
you don’t have them. Talk WITH the viewer, not at them.
