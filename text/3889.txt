Business Investigations

Today, I’m going to talk about some basic tools
you can use to investigate businesses.
I’ll also dive in deep and talk about mining the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for
data.

Challenges
• Investigating businesses is hard. In some
respects, it can be more difficult than
investigating government.
– Not subject to public records requests
– Don’t have to talk
– Pay lots of money to powerful lawyers and savvy
PR people
– Control the world

Stuff I can’t live without.

BASIC TOOLS

Basic tools
• Things I use almost every day.
• Not all these tools will be available in your
newsroom.
• You may have access to tools I haven’t listed
here.

Accurint/LexisNexis
• Powerful public records databases include a wide
range of data on all types of businesses.
• Particularly useful for locating employees,
addresses, telephone numbers.
• Also contains:
– Executive compensation
– State license filings
– News archives
– And a lot more

• Expensive, but many news outlets have access.

Accurint/LexisNexis
How I’ve Used It

• Develop sources at companies. Call every
person working for a firm and one of them
might want to talk.
• Less useful, more fun: develop social networks
of people who share common addresses,
phone numbers and EINs (metadata!).

S&P Capital IQ
• Detailed information about publicly traded
companies.
• Screen for companies across a wide array of
events.
• Display historical timelines, including lawsuits,
corporate filings, announcements and many
other events.

S&P Capital IQ
How I’ve Used It

• Regularly use it to screen for companies. Some
examples:
– Bankruptcies
– Buybacks
– “Directors at Distressed Companies”
– “Companies with Lots of Cash”
– Recently delisted companies

PACER
• “Public Access to Court Electronic Records”
• (Almost) all publicly available documents
relating to federal civil and bankruptcy cases.
• Accounts are free, as are limited searches ($15
per quarter).
• Search all 94 US court districts at once.

PACER
How I’ve Used It

• I love and hate PACER in equal measure. The
search is unbelievably burdensome and having
to pay $0.10 for every single page is
outrageous.
• That being said, I’ve used PACER as a research
tool for scores of stories.
• For example: Bankruptcy dockets include
audits, expense breakdowns, details about
creditors and much, much more.

Other basic resources
• City/county/state license records
– Get complaints, violations, license information, hugely useful,
generally available for FOIA

• GuideStar
– Not all businesses make a profit. Great for researching nonprofit
orgs

• LionShares by FactSet
– Information about corporate holdings (who owns what)

• Property tax records
– Databases reveal all properties under taxing authority

• Campaign finance/lobbying (state & federal)
– Find out what companies want and who they’re paying to get it

Looking for a free resource that has more information than
you can possibly mine in a lifetime?

US SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION

U.S. Securities & Exchange
Commission
Since 2004, the SEC has taken in nearly 10
million filings from more than 400,000
companies and individuals, including:
Form

Description

Filed since 2004*

Form 4

Trades by company insiders

4,141,990

Form 8-K

Material news events

894,384

Forms 10-Q and 10-K

Quarterly and annual reports

345,562

DEF 14A

Proxy forms detailing
corporate pay and board
membership

65,269

* As of May 28, 2013

There are many ways to access SEC filings.
Today, I’ll talk about two of them:
• Searching EDGAR (“Electronic Data-Gathering,
Analysis, and Retrieval”)
• Downloading filings in bulk from the SEC’s FTP
site

Searching SEC Filings

Searching SEC Filings

Searching SEC Filings

Searching SEC Filings

Can we broaden this?
Yes.
Using SEC bulk data, we’ll find other material
news filings (8-Ks) that were followed by large
changes in price.

From the SEC’s FTP site (ftp://ftp.sec.gov/edgar/fullindex/), it’s easy to access “master” index files that
contain lists of every SEC filing.

SEC Bulk Data
• Five basic pieces of information:
– CIK (“Central Index Key”) is a unique identifier
assigned by the SEC to each company (and
individual)
– Company name
– Form type
– Date filed
– Link to text of filing

SEC bulk data looks like this

SEC Bulk Data
• Put SEC bulk data in a spreadsheet or a
database.
• We can download every filing and analyze
(insider trading forms, for example).
• Or we can analyze filing data (“metadata”).

SEC filing data in a spreadsheet

After adding in stock prices* for each
company before and after the news events
(8-Ks), we can sort and isolate news that
had the biggest impact on the market.

*For those of you paying attention, yes, there's a little sleight of hand here. Getting stock prices for
publicly traded companies is a bit outside the scope of this presentation, but if you're interested,
come talk to me.

Material news releases (8-Ks) accompanied
by the largest change in price.

Now is a good time to learn how to mine SEC
filings for interesting information.

Slowly, the agency has been forcing companies to
move away from filings that look like this…

And this…

And this…

To a standard format called XBRL.

XBLR (“eXtensible Business
Reporting Language”) doesn’t look
pretty, but it can be easily
processed by a computer.

SEC Bulk Data
• If you learn to parse XBRL from filings, you
have access – in bulk – to information many
companies charge thousands for.
• I used this information to build a database of
all trades by corporate insiders.
• Cross-reference insider trades with significant
material news filings.
• Stories abound.
