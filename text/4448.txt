The ART of the Interview
(Joce Sterman/WJLA Washington, DC)
**CAPTURE PEOPLE IN THEIR “NATURAL HABITAT”
--Interview people doing what they do in the places they do it
--Giving them an activity to focus on takes away their nerves
**DON’T MAKE YOUR INTERVIEW SUBJECTS A CARDBOARD CUTOUT
--Leave the mic on as you chat
--Take them other places and put them in motion
--Get what you need, then don’t be afraid to take risks and re-ask questions for new angles/variety
**DON’T BE AFRAID OF THE UNCOMFORTABLE MOMENT
--Don’t cut off an emotional moment out of awkwardness
--Respect peoples’ emotions and allow them the courtesy of feeling them without cutting in with
another question
**FOLLOW THE BOY SCOUT MOTTO: BE PREPARED
--You should know everything there is to know about the person you’re interviewing
--Role play!! Have potential follow-ups ready
--Have your documents in hand – separated and organized by topic
**DON’T SUPPLY A LIST OF QUESTIONS – IT’S A CONVERSATION NOT A TEST
--You have an obligation to prepare the person you’re interviewing for what you want to talk about
--Be upfront & provide a detailed overview that includes any specifics you want to cover & any crucial
details…BUT providing a list 1-10 will result in canned responses
--This is not a “gotcha” tactic – rather an attempt to have an actual conversation about the topic
