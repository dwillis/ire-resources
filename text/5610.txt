Developing sources on the beat Maria Perez – Milwaukee Journal Sentinel
•

If you are new to a beat or a place…
o

Ask people around you, your predecessor and read former beat stories to beat find the
people you should be in touch with.

o

Then just call them. Tell them that you are new to the beat. Tell them you want to learn
from them, about the beat, about the community.

o

Meet in person whenever you can.

o

Go to their territory. Meet at their office, their laboratory, in a coffee shop or restaurant
they like, ask them to show you around.

o

Always ask them which other people you should meet.

•

Think out of the box. Which would be good sources for your beat that aren’t traditionally
considered so? It could be the bodega owner, or that person in the block who knows every
neighbor, or that small nonprofit that tutors students.

•

Think about diversity. Try to build sources that belong to different minority/socioeconomic
groups present in your community and who can bring a different perspective.

•

Try to go to events where you can meet potential sources.

•

Write small stories that can lead you to meet more sources and start to get your name out.
Features can be good for this.

•

Stay in touch.

•

How to find sources when there seems to be none?

•

o

Try to resort to databases and public records. Use those as an index to find people
affected by an issue, or who know about an issue –like attorneys in specific cases.

o

Attorneys and other professionals have digital forums. Ask someone to post a call for
anyone who could know about your tip.

o

Reach out to people/groups/influencers through social media.

Sources on the immigration beat
o

Get sources to open up:
▪

Think about non-traditional immigration sources.

▪

Knocking on doors works far better than phone calls.

▪

Is there anyone in the community who they trust and can vouch for you?

▪

Be honest: Explain what you are doing, what you can and can’t do. Be extra
clear about name use.
