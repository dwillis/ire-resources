FOIA & Government Databases:
Best Practices for Requesters

 Â 
 Â 
 Â 
 Â 

x Know that there is no central government database. There are 100 Federal agencies Â² 15 Cabinetlevel departments and 85 smaller agencies. They each keep separate records and databases, though
sometimes components within an agency share databases, which can complicate processing of a
request for information within that database.
 Â 
x Learn which databases agencies have and the types of information contained within those databases.
x Noodle around on data.gov, agency websites and in agency records schedules (search the web using

request. Or you might learn something that helps you better frame your request.
x Realize that most agency databases are not designed with FOIA in mind. Also, databases have their
shortcomings and the data you seek may not be in the exact form you want.

be in comma-, tab-, ASCII or other delimited format, which is generally easily saved from databases
and is usable on a standard desktop computer with commercial off-the-shelf software.
x Be patient. FOIA requires agencies to respond to requests within 20 business days;Í¾ however, the 20day limit is difficult if not impossible for many departments and agencies to meet because of a high
volume of requests and/or inadequate resources. Ask for an estimated time of completion or work
out a strategy with the agency for regular updates if the delay is going to be lengthy. Resist the urge
to flood the agency with frequent email messages or letters regarding the same request. Excessive
paperwork slows the process, making FOIA less efficient for all requesters and the agency itself.
x Ask the FOIA professional with whom you are working for a technical point of contact who can
