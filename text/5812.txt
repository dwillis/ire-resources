Act Blue data...
According to Chris Zubak-Skees “we found that much of the Democratic money in
the midterms came from out-of-state donors. And we found super donors like
Sybelle Barlow, 91, of Concord, Mass. who gave a minimum of 4,877 contributions
to candidates in the midterm.”

Some other ideas...
● How PACs operate
● 2020 candidate vetting
● Donor profiles (state and federal level)

State level

The state $$$
Following the money outside the election

The lobby isn’t just a room.

What is reported?
● Payments from clients?
● Entertainment of lawmakers?
● Bills/positions lobbied for specific clients?
● Bundled contributions?
● Contributions from clients?
● NCSL is a good resource

Are there…
● Windows where lobbyists/clients can’t
donate or lawmakers can’t solicit?
● Leadership PACs? & does above apply to
them?
● Bans on corporate giving or no?
● Great resource: Campaign Finance Institute

Corporate cash...

Corporate cash in Oregon

How much do lobby clients give to campaigns?

What do specific industries donate to campaigns?

Labor unions vs business

Also, cannabis

Current events - PG&E

Some resources...
● Follow the Money - by legislative
committees, industry, comparisons with other
lawmakers
● FCC political ads - RSS feeds or use Klaxon
to watch
● IRW’s Public Accountability Search (going on
right now!)

Name standardization

on this Ben Welsh
tutorial. Figuring out
which names is still a
manual process. Old

Local level

“It is foolish for any elected official to say
that money doesn’t influence access.
Obviously, that’s why people contribute,
that’s why they volunteer.”
— Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto, during first
primary campaign
“It comes down to the candidate: Who
they are taking the contribution from
and why they are taking it. To rule them
all the same, wouldn’t be accurate.”
— Allegheny County Executive Rich
Fitzgerald
“Let’s be frank. There are always going
to be undue influences in these
situations, caps or no caps.”
— Pennsylvania State Rep. Jake Wheatley

Motivation: What do we know?
“A donor’s contribution is not an act of kindness, nor is it a personal
favor. People donate to a campaign because … their contribution serves
their needs — not the candidate’s or the fundraiser’s.” — Emily’s List
“It is extremely important for anyone involved in fundraising for a
campaign to understand that political donors do not give out of a sense
of philanthropy, but because of their own vested interest in the
candidate’s political victory. … Donors contribute when a fundraiser can
demonstrate how they will beneﬁt through the election of the
candidate.” — NPG VAN’s Guide to Basics of Fundraising

If you can see all the data, what can you learn?
Signals and patterns in a donor’s giving over time that are
meaningful include:
●
●
●
●

Who do they give to? Candidate vs. candidates — discriminate or
indiscriminate?
When do they give to who? Early donor vs. last-minute donor.
Other timing considerations.
When and by how much does the amount vary?
Do they give in non-competitive races? In oﬀ-election years?

And we can make it
more useful.

Assigning motivation:
What are the ethical and accuracy
considerations when categorizing and
labeling?

Highlighting relationships:
When is it OK to group donors together and
how do you match them?

Matching names in the records:
What practical choices do you make? Can you
ever get it right 100 percent?

Your questions?
