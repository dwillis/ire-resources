Collaboration: tips & techniques
Or, “What I wish someone
had told me a year ago”

inewsource & KPBS

Basics of our partnership
 inewsource is a data-driven investigative

journalism team embedded in the KPBS newsroom
 KPBS is San Diego’s PBS and NPR affiliate
producing news for web, radio and TV.
 inewsource hands over fully-produced audio and
video shorts and features for KPBS TV and radio.
We also produce data-based interactive web
applications to share.
• We also partner with other outlets,
nationally and statewide

Documenting the “end of life”
 Joanne Faryon worked as KPBS’ primary reporter and co-

producer on series of videos and radio spots.
 When Does End of Life Begin?

 I worked as videographer, photographer and editor on series
 Needed to be sensitive because of topic, but needed to make sure

we gathered all the elements we’d need to tell the full story.

Workflow tips: Before the story
 If working with someone directly, make sure you

understand the story as well as she does (or almost as
well) before embarking.
 Think about all possible outlets/mediums for your story
as early as possible (TV? Web? Radio? All?).
 If possible, think about length of potential story for
each outlet. 4 min radio? 5 min TV? 90 sec radio?
 Treat everything as potential radio/TV material. At the
very least radio.

Workflow tips: Gathering the story
 Get the wireless microphone on your subject

ASAP… start recording
 Two-camera setup – cutaways

 Extra batteries and memory cards

Workflow tips: Post
 Download everything to computer, pay someone to

transcribe long interviews – read.

 Analyze what you have and what you don’t.
 Work with collaborator to clearly define what’s

possible and what is not.
 Isolate things that can make great short stories
 Betty
 Officers
 Port Authority

Delivering: Final product(s)
 Understand the strengths of different mediums – play to those

strengths, eg….
 We’ve found people enjoy stories in small bites – space out
the bites.
 No matter the medium, engage in social media for promotion
and feedback.
 Talk with collaborator after about what went wrong. Talk

about what went right. Talk about everything – maintain an
open dialogue and you’ll figure it all out quick.

Putting Data

on TV
The Case of the Mello-Roos Map
inewsource and KPBS

When the story is the map
 One in 10 homeowners paying an extra property tax
 No one was paying attention to this tax for decades
 Collected data from county treasurer, mapped who was

paying and how much
 Amounts varied wildly, street to street, neighbor to

neighbor

How to get people to the map
 What story we could tell?

explainer/
 Make the data journalist a “character” in the story

When they won’t go on camera
Web story: documents and quotes, but the one man
who approves the tax won’t go on camera

Sent them back to the map

It doesn’t always work
 Second chances
