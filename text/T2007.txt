General advice

Master how your court system works. Courts are anything but
uniform. Even courts in different counties in the same state can
have significantly different ways of managing cases. Tradition,
court rules, legal precedent and state law are all factors that
influence how courts operate. Study these so you’ll know what
happens and why.
Study court systems in other states. Knowing what's done right
elsewhere can help you spot what’s wrong in your system (and vice
versa).
Databases help you stay organized. The Courier-Journal didn’t
have access to the Kentucky court system’s case management
database, so we built our own. Several, in fact. Handcrafted
databases help you keep track of thousands of details that would
be impossible to get a handle on otherwise.
Never assume court records are complete or accurate. Neither the
court files themselves nor the court’s computerized tracking
system should be taken as gospel. Both can be incomplete or
inaccurate, as The Courier-Journal found in Justice Delayed,
Justice Denied. Getting it right means doing your legwork.
Interview everyone involved in the case, if you can. Obtain court
videotapes or tape recordings. Ask to see the prosecutor’s file,
which may have information not found in court records. Get police
records, which also may shed additional light on what happened.
Get too much rather than too little. Going through court files
and copying records is time consuming. It’s tempting to enter
information in a database and skip the copying. Don’t – those
records have information that will be significant later, and they
will help you double-check your database to make sure it’s
accurate.
Give your subjects plenty of time to respond. They may have a
perfectly reasonable explanation for what at first glance seems
unreasonable. It’s also a good way to spot weaknesses in your
investigation. Better to know sooner than later.

Software we used
•

Microsoft Access (www.microsoft.com/access/) – The most common
desktop database program. C-J reporters typed information into
databases either directly or via a Web interface on our
newsroom’s intranet.

•

•
•

•

•

•

Microsoft Excel (www.microsoft.com/excel/) – Reporters often find
Excel easier to work with than Access because it takes less
effort to get started. Information entered in Excel can easily be
imported into Access later.
SPSS (www.spss.com) – Datasets from the National Archive of
Criminal Justice Data come in SPSS format.
Omnipage Pro (www.scansoft.com/omnipage/) – Kentucky’s
Administrative Office of the Courts would only provide data in
Adobe Acrobat PDF format, which can’t be edited or imported into
Excel or other programs. Omnipage Pro can take PDF files and
convert them into text you can then manipulate or search.
Perl (www.perl.org) – Perl is a free programming language that’s
a great all-purpose tool for manipulating, cleaning up and
displaying data. But it’s for hardcore geeks only because it’s
difficult to learn.
Windows Server 2000 / Active Server Pages
(www.microsoft.com/windows2000/) – These run our newsroom
intranet, increasingly a must-have tool for any collaborative
project.
GenericDB (www.genericdb.com) – This comes in free and $28
versions. In a matter of minutes you can take a database and
share it with others on your intranet. It creates a Web page that
allows you to search, sort and update your database - even export
your data to Excel.
