Half the battle in reporting on the military involves
adroitly gathering information on your own using military
web sites, budget documents and congressional reports that
otherwise sometimes takes days and longer to gather through
military public affairs channels.
This is never more true than trying to report on how
the Pentagon's $79 billion procurement budget in fiscal
2006 or how the U.S. is spending $18.4 billion in
reconstruction money in Iraq.
To get up to speed on current major weapons programs
you need to know the contractors. Start with some of the
most useful info on the Pentagon's official web site,
Defense link:
Statistical Information Analysis Division (SIAD)
http://siadapp.dior.whs.mil
Track the top 100 contractors by name, unit and service
ranking by clicking the "Historical Reports" link.
Checking here would allow you to get a quick sense of
Halliburton Inc.'s defense contracting'dollars over the
year. Be sure to check Top contractors by military service.
Under Historical Report and 2005 data you can listings of
Prime Contract Award By State (enclosed in handout), top
100 contractor listings since 1996 and specialized
State/contractor breakdowns under the "General Interest"
section.
The smartest move you can make if assigned to cover
the military is getting a copy of Ed Offey's excellent
primer 'Pen and Sword1* from Marion Street Press,
marionstreetpress.com. It covers everything from organizing
the beat to war coverage.

GAO report: Defense acquisitions: Assessments of Major
Weapons programs: GAO-05-301. March 2005. The last three
pages contain staff listing by weapons program. Their phone
numbers can be gleaned off GAO website at
http://www.gao.gov/about.gao/phonebook/orgphonebook.pdf
Weapons program costs are published twice a year in
Selected Acquisition Reports, or SARs. Here's you'll find
detailed paper work outlining total program costs.
The Lockheed Martin Corp. F/A-22 program assembled outside
Atlanta in Marietta is estimated to cost $71.9 billion, of
which $36 billion has been spent to date, according to
documents posted April 30 at www.acq.osd.mil/ara/am/sar
There is no single readily accessible document to obtain
the individual price tag of a system. The key question to
ask is - what is the procurement unit acquisition cost in
inflation-adjusted "Then Year'' dollars. Priced this way,
the F/A-22 is estimated to cost $258 million. The services
like to quote less inclusive dollars.
Check budget documents posted for fiscal 2006 on the
Pentagon Comptroller URL-- http/www.dod.mil/comptroller/
The most valuable book is Program Acquisition Costs By
Weapon System. It gives a detailed breakdown of the dollars
requested for specific systems plus names of contractors
and subcontractors.
Follow what happens to the defense budget and weapons and
programs of interest reviewing the actions of the House and
Senate Armed Services committees at Thomas.loc.gov. Search
committee links for listing of their respective reports
that accompany the bill.
The Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments at
csbaonline.org and Project on Government Oversight,
pogo.org provide the best compilations of publicly
available defense budget and weapons information. POGO also
has a searchable database of contractor fraud cases. The
Air Force General Counsel publishes a "Fraud Facts"
newsletter available at http://www.afnet.safgc.hq.af.mil.
Google for the April 2005 edition which has a good
compilation and comment on the recent Boeing/tanker case.

To check weapons performance - and get a sense for the
types of once public documents purged by the Pentagon from
web sites after 9/11 - review the Pentagon Director of
Operational Test & Evaluation annual report at the sites of
the Council for a Livable World, Project on Government
Oversight and Globalsecurity.org
The Defense Contract Management Agency gathers information
on contractor performance. DCMA is the agency that directly
monitors ongoing performance and has Contract Management
Officers at selected major sites throughout the country. A
complete listing of "Districts"
can be found at DCMA.mil.
For a sample, DCMA has plant CMOS at Boeingls Philadelphia
facility, 610-591-8500; General Electric, Lynn,
Massachusetts, 781-594-2824 and Boeing Co.'s Seal Beach,
California plant, 562-593-3620.
The East Coast Public Affairs Office is located in Boston 617-753-4297. The West Coast P.R. office is 310-900-1021.
DMCA commanders often issue Contractor Deficiency Reports
or Cure Notices to companies determined to be performing
poorly on contracts. These are documents to be aware of if
you hear the contractor is performing poorly.
U s e f u l Iraq S i t e s :

Defenselink.mil under "Press
resource^,^^ has updated
tabulation of Iraq Killed in Action, non-hostile fire and
wounded, including a breakdown since May 1, 2003 when
President George Bush declared an end to major hostilities.
The Special Inspector General For Iraq Reconstruction
Inspector General has a well-organized site at
http://www.siqir.mil/ Click on "Quarterly Congressional
Reports" for voluminous material on how money is being
spend. Appendix G is a listing of all U.S. contracts
awarded for Iraq, including Halliburtonls Kellogg, Brown
and Root. Good fodder for local stories.
Personnel Issues Resource: Probably the most useful, onestop shopping guide on military personnel issues that any
reporter covering military should possess is published by
MilitaryTimes Media Group called "The Handbook for
Military Life."

Among the most useful pages are those that outline military
rank. For a copy call Elisha Galbraith, 703-642-7351, Email - egalbra@atpco.com
Personnel Deployment Statistics:

The Defense Manpower Data Center compiles monthly detailed
lists by state and demographics of the personnel deployed
overseas for the global war on terrorism, including how
much of the force has been deployed more than once. (See
handout for April 30 stats.) Good raw material for stories
on state personnel deployments. Earlier reports can be
obtained by calling the Pentagon press office, Lt. Col.
Ellen Krenke, 703-697-5134 or ellen.krenke@osd.mil
Iraq Contractor deaths

The U.S. Labor Department Office of Workman Compensation
receives statistics from U.S. and foreign companies on the
number of death and injury claims they are filing under a
1941 law called the Defense Base Act. The Act requires
companies that received government contracts overseas to
take out DBA insurance for deaths and injuries and are paid
by private carriers but could evidentially be reimbursed by
the federal government.
The statistic can be requested via e-mail from Labor
Department spokesperson Dolline Hatchett at
Hatchett.Dolline@dol.gov. You can ask for Iraq-only claims
starting with 2003, or worldwide statistics. Titan Corp.,
of San Diego, which supplies translators and interpreters
for the U.S. military, as of May 10 had 126 death claims -the largest of any contractor. Halliburton and its
subcontractors recorded 65 deaths, the second largest
number.
If you have the survivors of contractor deaths in your
circulation areas, there may be a story in tracking down
how well the claims/reimbursement process works for them or
whether they are encountering insurance company resistance.
(See enclosed story)

The best way to keep on top of military coverage is to
inquire about getting electronic versions of the Pentagon

Current News Early Bird news summary. The daily document
gets wide readership across the military worldwide and
among the senior leadership. Full-time defense reporters
should be able to make their case for inclusion to Carol
Rippe, Early Bird editor. 703-428-0037 or
cmrippe@hq.afis.osd.mil
Enclosed in the handout is an up-to-date listings of public
affairs officials and accounts for the Pentagon Office of
Public Affairs.
The military services are located at:
The Army worldwide public affairs directory is located at
www4.army.mil/ocpa.
The Air Force is www.palink.hq.af.mil
The Navy link:

Service Audits

Securing access to service audits. If you have a military
installation in your area you need to be familiar with how
to access audits from the Army Audit Agency, Navy and Air
Force agencies. In fact, as part of your beat coverage of a
base or naval station, meet the resident auditors to
cultivate and get a copy of the agency's Audit Plan that
lays out what its auditors plan to review. A source for
many stories.
The strategy is' to look what's listed in the IG semi-annual
and then request the titles of audits published between
edit ions.
For a master list of audits, first check the listing in the
Pentagon Inspector General semi-annual report at
dodig.osd.mil. Click on Semi-annual link and review
service-level titles.
To secure Air Force audits, call Air Force public affairs
at the Pentagon, 703-695-0640. Ask for the desk officer
handling the AFAA. You'll be able to email report numbers
and ask for past audits of your installation, usually
without FOIA.

The Navy Audit Service has a helpful web site that actually
lists titles as they are published and FOIA contacts at
http://www.hq.navy.mil/navalaudit.
The Army Audit Agency does not publish its report names so
everything must be FOIA'd -- titles and reports.

For purposes of counting "deployments" by member, location is not considered. Breaks between deployments or
"dwell times" of less than 21 days are considered to be a single deployment in CTS. This is done in order to
account for legitimate breaks in a deployment such as R&R or emergency leave.

INTRODUCTION
NOTES ON COVERAGE
Data in these tables (taken from the former PO6 and PO9 publications) reflect the net value of debit and credit procurement actions collected from the
DD Form 350 data system; (i.e., terminations, price changes, or other downward adjustments are deducted from a contractor's total award amount, while
modifications and other positive adjustments are treated as increases). If the debit amount exceeds the credit amount, a negative sign is placed to the right of
the net amount displayed. Procurement awards include definitive contracts; the obligated portions of letter contracts; and job orders, task orders, delivery
orders, or any other orders against existing contracts. Contracts for research and development, services, construction, and supplies and equipment are also
included. Contracts awarded by DoD to other U.S. Government Agencies as intragovernmental orders and foreign military sales (reimbursable sales to foreign
governments) are also included.
The database from which information for this report is collected does not include data on those parts of indefinite quantity contracts (except for
petroleum products) that have not been translated into specific orders to businesses, those contracts that have not yet become mutually binding agreements
between the government and the contractor, or prime contracts awarded by other U.S. Government Agencies and financed with DoD funds.

TOTALS

a

The United States total in the tables includes all contracts awarded for work performed in the United States. The United States, as used here,
includes the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the outlying areas of the United States. The United States outlying areas include American Samoa, the
Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, the Marshall Islands, Northern Manana Islands, the Trust Territory of Palau, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Minor Outlying
Islands, and the Virgin Islands of the United States.
The subtotal "NOT DISTRIBUTED BY STATE" includes all contract awards from the DD Form 1057 data system for performance in the United States.
This subtotal also includes all contract awards, regardless of size, for performance in the United.Statesoutlying areas and all contract awards for performance
in classified locations.
State subtotals include the net value of procurement awards from the DD Form 350 data system awarded to each state and the District of Columbia.
The total United States prime contract awards, including outlying areas, during FY 2004 totaled $212.7 billion, an increase of $10.1 billion or
4.7 percent from FY 2003.

LOCATION OF CONTRACTS
Contract work is not necessarily performed in the state where the contract is awarded. Most manufacturing contracts have been attributed to the
contractor's location where the product will be processed and assembled. When contract work has been performed at more than one plant, the contract has
been attributed to the location where the largest dollar amount of work was produced. Both construction and service contracts have been attributed to the
state where the work is to be performed. Contracts for transportation and communications services have been attributed to the state where the contractor's
home office is located. For purchases from wholesale or other distribution firms, the location is the contractor's business address.

Pentagon's Reliance on Civilians Surges, Death Claims Show

Pentagon's Reliance on Civilians Surges, Death Claims Show
By Tony Capaccio
Nov. 18 (Bloomberg) -- Total death insurance claims by
contractors in Iraq have risen more than sixfold from 2003, U.S.
government figures show, as nearly as many civilians are working
overseas as soldiers.
Companies so far this year have filed claims for 157 deaths
and 516 serious injuries, based on U.S. Labor Department figures
given to Bloomberg News yesterday. Almost 60 percent of those
civilians who died worked for Halliburton Co. and Titan Corp. In
2003, contractors claimed 23 deaths and 132 serious injuries.
"The figures illustrate a historic degree of reliance by the
U.S. military on private contractors in Iraq, as well as the
significant dangers these civilians bear in a combat zone," said
Peter Singer, a defense analyst at the Brookings Institution in
Washington.
It was a "huge story when we unfortunately crossed the 1,000
killed mark, but in reality it focused on an artificial figure -including private deaths, we were over that number already,"
Singer said.
Halliburton, the biggest U.S. contractor in Iraq, and Titan,
the top provider of Army translators, have filed the most claims
for employees killed or wounded in Iraq. Halliburton units through
yesterday have filed 747 of 1,346 Iraqi-related claims, including
16 deaths, while Titan has filed 192 claims, including 77 deaths. A
total of 78 companies filed insurance claims.
Insurance Coverage
The 1941 Defense Base Act requires insurance coverage for
workers in combat zones hired under U.S. contracts. Every U.S.
company bidding on government work overseas in places such as Iraq,
Kuwait, or Bosnia and Herzegovina must buy insurance for its U.S.
and foreign workers, including Iraqi personnel, from private U.S.
carriers.
About 60,000 U.S. civilians are working in Iraq alongside
138,000 U.S. troops. Another 85,000 Iraqis employed on U.S.
projects are also eligible for benefits under the Base Act.
"Everyone knows Iraq is dangerous -- something that the most
recent killings tragically reminded us -- but the DBA figures are
important in that they provide the raw numbers policymakers and
analysts need in an area of public policy that has a surprising
lack of public inf~rmation,~'
Singer said.

Companies are reimbursed for premiums as part of their
overhead billing to the government. The U.S. also will repay
insurance carriers if the claims are eventually certified as
eligible under another law called the War Hazards Act, although no
Iraq claims have fallen in this category yet, said Dolline
Hatchett, a Labor Department spokeswoman.
"We are working to ensure employees of contractors are
properly covered for workplace injuries as required by the law, and
that they and their families understand this coverage," said
Shelby Hallmark, director of the Office of Workers' Compensation
Programs, in a statement to Bloomberg News.
"The department will continue to provide compliance
assistance to insurance brokers, contractors and contracting
officers to ensure they receive the information they need and that
they advise their employees properly," he said.
Insurance carriers paid out $10 million in 2003 for Base Act
benefits, according to Labor Department figures. For some families
of civilians slain in combat zones, the benefits have not come as
quickly as expected.
Death of a Translator
Rita Mikha, whose 44-year-old husband Emad died April 3 of a
heart attack, waited until mid-September for payments from an
American International Group Inc. underwriter after it initially
contested the death claim.
Emad Mikha, a meat cutter from Sterling Heights, Michigan,
volunteered as a translator after seeing a Titan television
advertisement last November, his wife said. Mr. Mikha, who was born
in Basra before moving to the U.S. when he was 12 years old,
deployed to Iraq that month and served with a 4th Infantry Division
task force where he translated "innumerable documents and
questioned dozens of suspected terrorist," according to a March 13
Army memo.
Insurance companies are required under the Base Act to pay
claims within 14 days of their receipt or file a formal notice with
the Labor Department contesting payment. The underwriter, Insurance
Company of the State of Pennsylvania, filed a formal notice April
12 contesting payments until it received more documents, including
an autopsy report.
The company is the No. 1 Defense Base claims underwriter, with
1,083 Iraq claims so far in 2004, according to the Labor
Department.
American International Group World Source began paying death
benefits to Mrs. Mikha in mid-September amounting to about $26,000
as of October 25, said company spokesman Andrew Silver.
The bi-weekly payments will continue until Mrs. Mikha either

remarries or dies, pending the outcome of an investigation the
company is conducting into the circumstances of the heart attack,
Silver said. The Labor Department would review the final
investigation and depending on its findings determine the extent of
long-term benefits, he said.
"The insurance company agreed to pay the claim voluntarily,"
said Mikha's attorney Marc Corriveau of Northville, Michigan, in an
e-mailed statement. "However, they are still disputing the
validity of the case and are pursuing a hearing to determine
causation. In every sense this was only a partial victory."
