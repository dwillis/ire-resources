About nonprofits
Roughly 2 million nonprofits in the United States. Key types include:
501(c)(3)
Religious, Educational, Charitable, Scientific, Literary, Testing for Public
Safety, to Foster National or International Amateur Sports Competition, or Prevention of
Cruelty to Children or Animals Organizations. [Donations to this type of nonprofit are
tax-deductible. Includes both public charities and private foundations. There are more
restrictions on foundations, which are usually supported by one or a handful of donors,
than public charities, which typically rely on government grants or a broader swath of
donors.]
501(c)(4)
Civic Leagues, Social Welfare Organizations, and Local Associations of
Employees. (Includes advocacy groups that can lobby on legislation.)
501(c)(5)
Labor, Agricultural, and Horticultural Organizations
501(c)(6)
Business Leagues, Chambers of Commerce, Real Estate Boards, etc.
501(c)(7)
Social and Recreational Clubs
501(c)(8)
Fraternal Beneficiary Societies and Associations
501(c)(12) Benevolent Life Insurance Associations, Mutual Ditch or Irrigation
Companies, Mutual or Cooperative Telephone Companies, etc.
501(c)(13) Cemetery Companies
501(c)(14) State-Chartered Credit Unions, Mutual Reserve Funds

Sources of Nonprofit Data
IRS
❖ Exempt Organization Business Master File Extracts.
CSV ​available​ with basic information on ​ 1.7 million nonprofits nationwide. Smaller files
available for individual states. Includes name, address, type of organization, and
revenue and assets.

❖ Form 990 Extract.
246 fields ​available​ for roughly 300,000 organizations, including amount of money spent
on fundraising.

❖ SOI Sample Data Files (Microdata)
Even more fields ​available​ for a sample of organizations.

❖ Basic stats

IRS also provides ​basic statistical charts​ on tax exempt organizations.

National Center for Charitable Statistics
Has added some additional fields to many of the main IRS files, available in its data
archive. You can find them ​here​. Note: It takes the IRS time to release the files and a bit
longer for NCCS to clean up the data. So there is a bit of a lag time.
Some of the files can be ​downloaded directly into R​.
Recently launched a new ​open data platform​ for nonprofit information.

Mastercard Donation Insights
Mastercard has ​data on donations​ made with credit cards.

Guidestar
Most journalists use Guidestar to look up nonprofit tax forms. But ​Guidestar​ will also sell
annual data files with selected fields for a fee ($1,500 to $2,000 per annual file). And it

will also do special data runs for a fee. (Guidestar says it offers a 50% discount off its
regular price to journalists and will occasionally provide data for free.)

Foundation Center / Candid
The ​Foundation Center​ compiles data on foundations, including grants.
The Center will do simple data runs for journalists, compiling a list of grants to a
particular organization or providing a list of the largest grants by region. (The
Foundation Center recently merged with Guidestar to form Candid).

Propublica Nonprofit Explorer
ProPublica's ​Nonprofit Explorer​ provides another way to look up nonprofit tax forms
(such as 990s). But ProPublica also provides an API to extract some basic data on
nonprofits.

State databases
Some state charity regulators maintain their own databases on nonprofits. For
example, Oregon has a ​CSV​ anyone can download with a list of all the charitable
organizations registered with the state.

Open990
Open 990​ makes a free database available to journalists with 100 fields (based on the
electronic 990s filed with the IRS). The organization can also provide customized data
sets.

New IRS 990 Data
What is the data?
After losing a FOIA lawsuit, the Internal Revenue Service recently started uploading
machine-readable versions of forms that nonprofits file electronically with the
government each year.
Time frame:​ The IRS has posted forms processed since 2011. The forms are
uploaded monthly. (Note: There is typically a lag of a few months between the time an
organization files a return and it is processed by the IRS.)
Types of forms:
990 (may also be listed as 990EO or 990O)
990EZ (filed by smaller organizations)
990PF (filed by private foundations)
What’s not available:
990-N (filed by very small nonprofits with gross receipts of $50,000 or less)
Forms filed on paper … of which there are still a lot!
How many organizations file:
More than 378,000 organizations filed electronic 990s, 990EZs or 990PFs in 2016.
There are about 1.5 million nonprofits in the United States, though most forms on paper
or file the 990-N - basically a postcard asserting that they are too small to file a full
return. Churches are non-profits but do not have to file the forms.
The electronic data is typically required for organizations with at least $10 million in
assets and 245+ employees, though others also choose to file online.
Format:
Each form is posted on AWS web server in XML format (which looks a bit like HTML with all the data sandwiched between tags).
Here are some random examples of what the forms look like:
https://s3.amazonaws.com/irs-form-990/201722269349300317_public.xml
https://s3.amazonaws.com/irs-form-990/201742279349100209_public.xml

So the first portion of a form might look like this:
<Return xmlns="http://www.irs.gov/efile" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
returnVersion="2015v3.0" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.irs.gov/efile">
<ReturnHeader binaryAttachmentCnt="0">
<ReturnTs>2017-08-15T08:46:25-07:00</ReturnTs>
<TaxPeriodEndDt>2016-09-30</TaxPeriodEndDt>
<PreparerFirmGrp>
<PreparerFirmName>
<BusinessNameLine1Txt>SKEEN & CO CPAS</BusinessNameLine1Txt>
</PreparerFirmName>
<PreparerUSAddress>
<AddressLine1Txt>615A BROOKSIDE AVE</AddressLine1Txt>
<CityNm>REDLANDS</CityNm>
<StateAbbreviationCd>CA</StateAbbreviationCd>
<ZIPCd>92373</ZIPCd>
</PreparerUSAddress>
</PreparerFirmGrp>
<ReturnTypeCd>990PF</ReturnTypeCd>
<TaxPeriodBeginDt>2015-10-01</TaxPeriodBeginDt>

How to find the files:
The IRS also has posted two sets of indexes to the files, one in JSON and the other in
CSV. ***WARNING: Clicking on the JSON link my crash your browser. Access it via the
command line.***
The indexes follow this format:
https://s3.amazonaws.com/irs-form-990/index_2017.json
https://s3.amazonaws.com/irs-form-990/index_2017.csv
The JSON entries look like this:
{"EIN":"042662873", ​This is the tax ID for the charity, like a SSN
"TaxPeriod":"201603", ​This is the year/month corresponding to the end of the fiscal year
covered by the return
"DLN":"93493243000066",
"FormType":"990", ​Will also say “990PF” or “990EZ”
"URL":"​https://s3.amazonaws.com/irs-form-990/201612439349300006_public.xml​”, ​Path to the
XML that contains all the text in the 990

"OrganizationName":"ELKS BUILDING CORP OF NORWOOD",
"SubmittedOn":"2017-01-04", ​Date processed by the IRS

"ObjectId":"201612439349300006",
"LastUpdated":"2017-01-11T22:15:15"}
The CSV entries are slightly different:
RETURN_ID
14054169
FILING_TYPE
EFILE
EIN
42662873
TAX_PERIOD
201603
SUB_DATE
1/4/2017 10:27
TAXPAYER_NAME ELKS BUILDING CORP OF NORWOOD
RETURN_TYPE
990O
DLN
93493243000066
OBJECT_ID
201612439349300000
Note: The CSV index is missing the full URL
But it you can create it by using the OBJECT_ID
https://s3.amazonaws.com/irs-form-990/​ + OBJECT_ID + _public.xml
The IRS has posted some basic information here:
https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-makes-electronically-filed-form-990-data-available-innew-format
https://aws.amazon.com/public-datasets/irs-990/
Note​: Organizations sometimes file multiple forms in the same year, because they
have amended their returns or changed their fiscal year.
Understanding the tags:
Every field in the 990 form should be contained in the XML. (The data should be
identical to the data in the PDF version.)
The IRS has published some stylesheets online, such as this one:
https://www.irs.gov/e-file-providers/current-valid-xml-schemas-and-business-rules-for-ex
empt-organizations-modernized-e-file
Or you can just look at an example of the XML and search for the information you are
looking for. (Or compare it to a PDF version of the same form.)

Note: ​For yes and no questions, filers often use “0” or “False” to mean “No,” while “1”
and “True” mean “Yes.”

Pitfalls with the XML tags:
● The tags can vary between forms. So you might need to look for one tag for the
standard 990 form and a different one for the 990PF.
● Not all the tags are contained in every filing. So certain tags might be missing
(like the year an organization was formed) when organizations leave that entry
blank.
● The tags can vary between years. For instance, a 2016 filing uses the tag
<FormationYr>1994</FormationYr> for the year an organization was formed. A
2013 filing for the same organization would look like this:
<YearFormation>1994</YearFormation>. We agree, this is nuts.
● For notes in schedules, it’s even messier. Organizations typically just manually
note which part of the form the note goes with. But sometimes they put that
notation within different tags, write the line number differently, or shove notes for
different questions into the same item.
● Organizations sometimes make typos (including in the organization name or
EIN).
Some different approaches to harnessing the data:
Todd took this approach:
Wrote a program in Python to:
1) Download the CSV index files.
2) Use the index files to identify the URL and download all the XML filings
Then Todd wrote a separate program to:
Loop through all the XML files, grabbed key fields, and put them in new CSV data files
An example of the programs is available here:
https://github.com/TWALLACK/IRS
Andrea took this approach:
1) Download the JSON files with Python.

2) Parse JSON and put the information into a SQL table.
3) Get the URLS from the JSON files and download all the XML files
4) Parse all the XML using PHP.1 You will use this information:
a) Filename: the actual name of the file
b) Sequence Number: some tags will be repeated, i.e. names of directors.
Our code figures out if there are repeat tags.
c) Field Names: The tag and all of its parent tags. From our XML example
above, the city of the tax preparer would be
ReturnHeader|PreparerFirmGrp|PreparerUSAddress|CityNm
d) Value: The actual content of the tag (Redlands)
5) Write the above output to a TXT file and upload that file into SQL Server. This will
be about 1 billion records so you need a lot of space.
6) Make individual tables based on the field names you need.
Other approaches
Some other programmers have created their own tools to grab the data.
For instance, here is a Python library by Jacob Fenton funded by ProPublica:
bit.ly/990data

Here are some scripts developed by Charity Navigator:
https://github.com/CharityNavigator/irs990
https://github.com/CharityNavigator/990_long

Examples of stories we’ve written using the data:
Charity Officials Are Increasingly Receiving Million-Dollar Paydays
About 2,700 people had seven-figure pay packages at the nonprofits in 2014, a number
that was up a third in three years, newly searchable IRS data show
Data used​: Form 990, Schedule J, Part II
Carl Icahn’s Charity Supports Education—It Also Lent Him $119 Million
According to a Wall Street Journal tally, more than 1,800 public charities reported
outstanding loans in fiscal 2014.
Data Used​: Form 990, Schedule L, Part II, Loans and/or From Interested Persons
Hundreds of People Made Gifts of Stock With Great Timing

Full Credit: Tom McGinty wrote this part in PHP because Andrea messed it up in Python.

Michael Milken was among hundreds of people who donated stock to charities near
price peaks or a few weeks before the stocks tanked, a Wall Street Journal analysis of
federal data shows. Such donations occurred more often than chance would dictate.
Data Used: ​Form 990PF, Schedule B, Part II, Noncash Property
Private Charitable Foundations Give Lavish Rewards to Insiders
Foundation officers use legal loopholes to self-deal, providing benefits to insiders such
as mutual-fund manager who earned nearly $5 million over eight years as a private
foundation trustee.
Data Used: ​Form 990PF, Part VII-B, Statements Regarding Activites
Employee theft ‘shockingly common’ at nonprofits
More than 1,100 tax-exempt organizations nationwide have reported theft,
embezzlement, or other major diversions of assets over the past seven years, according
to electronic filings with the Internal Revenue Service.
