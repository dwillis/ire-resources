secret.

The Investigative Beat

Arizona prosecutors dropped charges
against Black Lives Matter protesters
after ABC15’S Dave Biscobing
revealed law enforcement had
painted the protesters as a criminal
gang and presented grand jurors a
case ﬁlled with one-sided and false
evidence. The department went on to
reassign nine oﬃcers. Prosecutors
admitted they’d failed to vet cases.

“Politically Charged is an ongoing
ABC15 investigation into protest
arrests and prosecutions by
Phoenix Police and the Maricopa
County Attorney’s Oﬃce.
From creating a ‘ﬁctional’ gang to
giving false grand jury testimony,
evidence shows oﬃcers and
prosecutors targeted groups and
leaders who protest against them.”

THE BOSTON GLOBE
Bianca Vázquez Toness holds schools accountable by
centering the voices of people affected, not those in
power. She exposed how oﬃcials were reporting
parents for suspected abuse and neglect when their
children missed virtual school. The Education Writers
Association recognized her as the best ed beat reporter
in the country, noting: “Nearly all of her pieces were told
not only through on-the-record accounts of families but
also supportive documents and data that illuminated the
depth and scale of the problem. That powerful
combination has routinely forced state and local leaders
to rethink their policies and practices.”

Pasco County Sheriff’s Oﬃce
generated arbitrary lists of people
it considers likely to break the law
to track and interrogate. After the
sheriff refused to release the
database, beyond the list of

Bedi and Kathleen McGrory used
software to match names to jail
bookings to ﬁnd at least 88 people

24.
