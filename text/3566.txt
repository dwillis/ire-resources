Reasons NOT to Use Data on Deadline

“I am sorry I won’t be much help to you on this
one. Nearly all of my database reports have
been longer term projects.”

Reasons NOT to Use Data on Deadline

“We’ve never built a database library here, and
getting data from agencies in this state is
never a simple process in a time crunch.”

Reasons NOT to Use Data on Deadline

“Investigative reporting should never be done
on a deadline... or something like that…”

Getting Ready

` Think creatively

` What ELSE do I want to know about this

breaking news?
` What would help viewers/readers understand
this event more?
` What DON’T we know after the obvious “nuts
and bolts”?
` What will help our organization’s coverage
‘stand out’ from our competition?

How to Proceed
` What data might be available?
` How easily is it accessed?
` Is it in a form I can understand and analyze?
` How fast can I understand and analyze it?
` What value could it provide to our coverage?
` Where do I go?
` Find relationships, put event into context.
` Make my pitch.
