Covering immigrant communities
●

Building sources
○ Get in contact with consulates, organizations, immigration lawyers
■ Check in with them periodically, grab coffee with them
■ Attend events they’re hosting, even if it’s just for sourcing
■ If there is something you don’t know, call experts to help you
understand the issue
○ Along with community events, attend events hosted by ICE or by CBP
○ Border Patrol and ICE each have a citizen’s academy.
■ This will allow you to get an inside look at their operations and make
contacts with agents
○ Ask to go on a ride along with ICE agents when they’re making arrests
○ Meet with the local ICE spokesperson for coffee
○ Keep in touch with people who know the issues that affect their communities:
bodega owners, volunteers – and that person who knows everyone in town.
○ Minority communities are diverse, have different problems. Learn about them,
about their history and their countries.

●

Putting sources at ease
○ Share your background.
○ Respect if someone tells you they’re not comfortable using their name. With
the new administration we found more cases of people not wanting to use
their full names.
■ In a recent project, Brittny Mejia used someone’s maiden name or
middle name as an alternative. In other cases, we simply did not
include their last name
○ Knocking on doors works better than phone calls.
○ Is there anyone who they trust and can vouch for you?
○ Be honest: explain what you are doing, what you can and can’t do.

●

Beware though of taking everything organizations say as fact. Both sides need to be
thoroughly fact checked.

Beyond immigration enforcement
●
●
●

●
●

Look for the issues, places and policies that are not inherently focused on immigrants
but end up affecting them in critical ways.
Look for the ways in which state lawmakers seek end runs around federal
immigration policy.
While it may be difficult getting data and documents from ICE and other federal
agencies, it may be remarkably easier getting relevant data and documents from
state and local agencies, law enforcement and courts.
Look for the intersections of immigrants/immigration and state/local policy and action.
“Peruse the perimeter.” What’s going on outside the spotlight, beyond the
conventional stories and focus, away from the news conferences and news
releases?

●
●
●

Recognize that even the “experts” may not be aware of the scope, depth and impact.
Learn about the issues that affect minority communities beyond immigration policy:
education, housing, labor conditions, infrastructure, drivers licenses…
You don’t need to find a community hero or a high school valedictorian to write a
story of abuse.

Landing your first project form the immigration beat
Develop the story idea
● Can you measure the scope? Find the data!
○ What agencies could gather data that will help you quantify the story?
○ Research online. Ask experts. If there’s form, there’s often a database.
○ Create your own data: from records requests, court cases, story clips…
● Write it down. Write your ideal nut graph/s. What evidence you have now and how
you plan to support what you say?
● Pitch it! To your editors and trusted colleagues.

Reporting
●
●

●
●

Consider building your own database to spot trends. It will help you see the forest,
not just the trees.
Records: think of alternative records, ask attorneys for the immigration files,
immigrants can sign a release so you can request their records from immigration
authorities, you can often attend immigration court hearings.
Follow the money! Understand the system. Who benefits? How?
Responsibility of law enforcement / regulators.

Writing
●
●
●
●
●
●

Try to write as you go and keep evolving nut graph/s.
Don’t stereotype: Details are one of the best antidotes; represent the complexity of
the people you write about and their reality.
Don’t just write about a community, write for them, about the issues they care about –
but don’t forget the rest of your readers.
Write in the language of the community you are reporting about.
Keep the unfairness, the abuse at sight throughout the story.
Write with the skeptical reader in mind.
