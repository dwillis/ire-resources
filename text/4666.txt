2.

There are so many tools we can use.

Language is the Currency of Politics
• Nearly all phenomena in politics can be studied
in some way using text.
• Consider:
– Legislative priorities (e.g., bill development)
– Lobbying (e.g., financial statements)
– Public opinion (e.g., open-ended survey questions)
– Media attention (e.g., news stories / transcripts)

Example: Laughter in the FOMC3

The FOMC:
A Powerful Fishbowl

How Do We Measure the FOMC’s
Mood?

• Sentiment analysis is useful, but:

– text-based sentiment is removed from latent variable
of interest
– operationally tricky (domain specific and noisy)

• How about laughter?
– physiological response to language
– observable

19

Data
• Transcripts of all FOMC meetings, 2005–2008
• 41 meetings
– 32 in person
– 9 conference calls

• Unit of analysis: sentence
– Max: 4,191 (December 15-16, 2008)
– Min: 217 (August 10, 2007)

• 84,463 sentences
– 83,295 non-humorous
– 1,168 humorous

Has the mood of the FOMC
changed?

24

Sentiment
• Options: word lists or sentiment classifiers
• We used: word lists developed by Loughran and
McDonald (2011) for financial texts
• Three non-mutually exclusive lists:
– Positive (e.g., “encouraging,” “favorable,” “strong”)
– Negative (e.g., “collapse,” “poor,” “shutdown”)
– Uncertain (e.g., “indefinite,” “maybe,” “seems”)

Has the type of humor changed?

30

Types of Humor
(using manual content analysis)
• Out-group: Taking aim at an outgroup (usually
Congress)
• Self-deprecation: Making fun of one’s self
• Process: Humor about the schedule, wording of
the statement, lunch or coffee breaks, and other
logistics
• Content (i.e., issue): Humor directly related to
the issue or topic at hand
• Playful banter: Humor about the dynamics
between members of the FOMC
31
• Collective self-deprecation: Making fun of the

Example of Process-Oriented
Humor
• “And we stipulate that the addition of that word,
which is not legally required, be expunged from
the record!” [Laughter] (Mr. Greenspan,
January 31, 2006)

32

Example of Playful Banter
• “I want to say a good word about President
Poole. I have sat next to him since I got here. I
would give him hyperbolic praise if he hadn’t
handed me the IT Oversight Committee;
otherwise, I think he is a wonderful human
being.” [Laughter] (Mr. Fisher, January 1,
2008)

Some Tools We Use
•

NLTK: http://www.nltk.org/ -- provides lots of different NLP tools (and data sets) in Python. NLTK
is a library you can call from within Python.

•

scikit-learn: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/ -- provides lots of different machine learning tools in
Python. Scikit-learn is a library you can call from within Python. Chase Davis ran a tutorial on using
scikit-learn at NICAR 2015: https://github.com/cjdd3b/nicar2015

•

Stanford CoreNLP: http://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/index.html -- provides lots of different
state-of-the-art NLP tools in Java. You can use it by running the Java program on your data
(processed appropriately) with appropriate command lines options. We used this to
tokenize our FOMC data and split it into sentences. We also used it to do sentiment analysis before
we realized that the sentiment analyzer in CoreNLP is trained on movie or product reviews.

•

Mallet: https://github.com/mimno/Mallet -- Mallet is another Java program. It provides various NLP
tools, but you should ignore all of
them except the topic modeling tools. For topic modeling, Mallet is state-of-the-art. It is incredibly
fast. You can use Mallet for nearly all your topic modeling needs. We used Mallet when we ran LDA
on our FOMC data early on in our project.

•

pandas: http://pandas.pydata.org/ -- provides data structures and simple data analysis tools in
Python. Use Pandas when you want to read
in a CSV (pandas' CSV-processing library is better than anyone else's) and then count things or
general aggregate and filter things and plot things. We used pandas for our FOMC project. We read 35
in CSVs produced by Stanford CoreNLP and then we counted various things of interest (like
