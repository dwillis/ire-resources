Financing
Q

Costs paid by “Folha de S.Paulo” and by
“UOL” (which belongs to “Folha”).

Q

Total cost: US$ 300,000 (mostly to a tech
company, TBA, that developed database
system and did the typing and scanning job).

Q

UOL tried to sell advertisement, but could not
find anyone interested.

Q

Some “neutral” funding is now pursued to
finance phase 2 (updates).

Q

If no new funding is found, the project might
die this year.
