NICAR Panel:
Time, Location and Context
Chicago, Illinois
Thursday, March 8 | ​Grand Ballroom III

https://www.ire.org/events-and-training/event/3189/3547/

Hashtag: #ire18geo
Panel description:
This diverse panel of experts will explore how the realm of big data, particularly, geographic data poses
opportunities and challenges for today’s newsrooms. Are newsrooms and journalists ready for the growth of
geographic and location-based data that will impact how news can be told and received? This panel will answer
this question by addressing the nuances of coding geographic and location-based data for a variety of contexts
from app and CMS development to story presentation; the challenges in analyzing big datasets that are
geographic or location-based in nature, and the overall geo-data mindset needed in journalism today.
Attendees will also come away with a handout of tips and techniques related to working in this geo-context.

Resources
Primer: Basic Concepts
What is geo? Location-based data? GIS? Geo-location? How is it being used in the news
industry today?

Uses of geo-data in journalism today:
○ Internal/Business:
■ Analyzing audience behaviors by location/demographics for internal
decision-making (i.e Google Analytics) - location intelligence.
○ Editorial/Engagement:
■ Using geographic data or mapping tools for storytelling/narratives.
○ Distribution/Targeting:
■ Facebook:​ By geotagging Posts/Pages, FB prioritizes the content in local
feeds, local search queries, and sends out local email alerts.
■ Google:​ Providing location metadata on event webpages enables Google
to prioritize events in "nearby" search results (​usage rising​) on
google.com and Google Maps app. Doesn’t work for articles on Google
yet - however, being specific about the location within narrative text
(“Bobs Burgers” vs “Bobs Burgers on Poplar Street in Washington DC”)
will give it a better chance to be caught by Google News’ algorithm.
■ Emergencies/Alerts/Email: ​USA Today's location-based newsletter vs
Hurricane Urma

Storytelling
What kind of stories can I tell with location/geo-data? What tools can I use?
GIS-driven enterprise reporting examples:
● The invisible hazard afflicting thousands of schools:

hools
Locative Narrative Examples:
● Out of Eden by Paul Salopek:

-roads/
● Escape Time​ - The Washington Post
● Interactive map exploring US-Mexico border​ - USA Today
● Hurricane Harvey Hits Houston / Before & After​ - NY Times

The Data
Where can I find location/geo-data?

Note: Accuracy and precision of location data and tools will likely always be slightly inaccurate
(​example of Google Analytics and smartphone GPS​). Be wise and skeptical - interview the
geo-data just like a source!
