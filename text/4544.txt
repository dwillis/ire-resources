Deep dive into Medicare Advantage:
The risk in risk scores

Medicare parts
• Four main parts to Medicare: A, B, C and D
• Part A is old idea of hospitalization
• Part B is fee for service when procedure done
• Part D is the drug coverage passed in 2004
• Part C is privatization build around an HMO idea

Part C
• Called Medicare Advantage where a patient has a contract with a
private insurance company.
• Private insurance company agrees to cover all hospitalization and
procedures like an HMO.
• But not all patients are in the same health: Risk scoring.
• Patients love it, so has support on both sides of the aisle.

Risk scoring
• The higher the risk score applied to a patient, the more money the
MA insurance company receives from the government.
• Risk scoring is an inexact science at best – is more of a guess at worst.
• So instead of fee-for-service upcoding in traditional Medicare Part B
(providers charging more for the same time and procedure over
time), MA risk scoring is giving more and more healthy patients
higher risk scores over time.

The data
• CMS Plan Payment Data: Includes the Medicare Advantage Part C
records at the plan level with contract and payment data.
• CMS Monthly Enrollment: Includes aggregated Medicare monthly
enrollment records at the county level.

• Fee-For-Service Data: Includes risk scores for traditional Medicare
program at the county level.

Mash up the databases
• Import into a database manager. We used Microsoft SQL Server.
• Clean and test data integrity.
• Join the three tables and select columns for analysis.
• Export to Excel as a single table for analysis.

Methodology
• Plan C costs and payments to private insurers are based on risk scores.
• FFS data includes calculated risk scores for comparison.
• Plan C data is at Plan level; FFS data is at county level.
• For comparison, weight Plan C data to calculate risk scores at the county
level.
• Calculate risk score gaps between MA private insurance plans and FFS.
• Calculate growth in risks scores over time and growing gaps over time.
• Calculate costs associated with gaps and growing risk scores.

Advice
• Understand risk scoring: Risk scores explained.
• Understand weighting.
• Know the limitations in the data. There are many.
• Be comfortable working with estimates and what you can conclude
from those estimates that actually constitutes evidence of risk score
upcoding.
• You are reducing uncertainty, not calculating an exact score.

Visualization reduces complexity
• How risk scores changed.

The project

Medicare Advantage Money Grab

Key findings
• Federal officials have made billions in “improper” payments to
Medicare Advantage plans traced to risk score errors.
• Medicare Advantage risk scores rose much faster than the national
average in hundreds of counties nationwide between 2007 and 2011.
That rise in risk scores cost taxpayers more than $36 billion,
attributable to aggressive billing than sicker patients.
• The failure to crack down on health plans that overbill doesn’t bode
well for the Affordable Care Act, which relies on a similar risk scoring
system.
