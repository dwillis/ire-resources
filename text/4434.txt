● Similar types of charts to Excel, but some
distinct options
● Can be helpful if data loading issues
● Sample data to test diff chart types right in
the file
● Can annotate notes for colleagues

TimeFlow
● https://github.
com/FlowingMedia/TimeFlow/wiki
● Structure your dates’ data by thinking of
what categories it belongs to
● Navigate among different views to better
understand your data
● Project is no longer under ongoing
development

Text visualization
● Example: Speeches, chapters, transcripts
● Netanyahu speech:
● Word frequency: Textalyzer
● Texteture: Network of how words are
connected
● DocumentCloud - entity extraction, how
often words show up
○ Consider exceptions of synonyms and stop words

Other visualizations (non-map)
● ManyEyes - Can explore w/data set used for
Excel
● Expands options to other viz - easier to swap
among them
● Can use for text word clouds (if you must)
● Heat map option is helpful
● Recently relaunched in the past yr - new
interface

Other visualizations (map)
● Google Fusion Tables
● Practice mapping Toronto Community
Centers
● Change column types to be location
● Geocoding = converting addresses to
locations
● See where trends/outliers are in your data
