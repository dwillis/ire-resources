In early 2003 Irvine businessman Mark Ellis bought control of Indiginet, a
nearly broke public company.1 Over the following three years, by Ellis’ own
accounting, the renamed Winsted Holdings paid him $60 million in stock and $2
million in cash.2
But an Orange County Register investigation found his success came at
a high price to others: employees whose paychecks bounced, landlords with
unpaid rents and franchisees saddled with unexpected six-figure bills.3
Investors fared worst of all. If you had purchased $1,000 in shares when
Ellis took over, your stake would now be worth three hundred-trillionths of a
penny.4
Selling stock was Winsted’s primary business. Between 2003 and mid
2006 the company sold at least 3 billion shares for nearly $4 million.5
The buyers were small investors such as Shaker Zayed, 22, who plays
the stock market while working in his father’s Cleveland convenience store. He
bought four million shares of Winsted for $400 last August because of a rumor on
an Internet message board. His father bought five million shares for $500.6
Today that stock is essentially worthless.7

Ellis purchase; see Indiginet 8-K, filed March 10, 2003; he acquired 271 million shares,
representing 72 percent of the stock, for $20,000. “Nearly broke”; see Indiginet 10-QSB, filed
Dec. 27, 2002; as of Sept. 30, 2002 Indiginet had $45,000 in assets and $526,000 in liabilities.

“Over the following three years”; spreadsheet analysis of cash and stock compensation that
Indiginet/Winsted reported paying to Ellis in 2003, 2004 and 2005, plus payments to companies
Ellis controlled, plus a $253,000 loan reported by accountants to the SEC but not included in
company compensation summary. Compensation reports for 2003 are inconsistent; originally
reported as $666,967 salary, $660k in other pay and (on a separate schedule) stock worth $740k;
in subsequent years, 2003 salary was listed as $350k plus $740k in stock. Thus salary over the 3
years is at least $2 million but could be $3.2 million.

“Employees”; two former employees, Victoria Schell and Kevin Shalz, took Ellis to the state
labor commissioner, won default judgments and then filed those judgments in court (OC Superior
Court #s 06-HL-00638 and 05-HL-05363. “Landlords”; Koll Center Irvine #2 (OCSC #02-CC18524) and Jeffrey Building LLC (OCSC #05-CC-00957) both sued Ellis or Ellis-controlled
companies for unpaid rent. “Franchisees”; I interviewed nine people who signed franchise or
consulting agreements with Ellis; most complained of cost overruns; see Rakesh Shishodia and
Dale Smith stories below.

$1,000 in stock, based on February 2003 price; Register analysis, applying all six reverse-splits,
based on prices reported by Bloomberg.

“Winsted’s primary business”; based on analysis of Winsted financial statements filed with SEC.
“At least 3 billion shares”; this was the number of new shares authorized in 10 issues filed with
the SEC; however, an analysis of reported shares outstanding over time suggests that Winsted
sold as many as 9 billion shares, or three times more than it authorized.

Interviews with Shaker Zayed Dec. 2, 2006, and Jan. 16, 2007.
7
“Essentially worthless”; the per-share price has not changed from the $0.00013 that the Zayeds
paid on Aug. 28. However, the stock no longer regularly trades. Since Sept. 1, it has traded on 30
of 100 available dates, always in small lots (never more than a few thousand shares at a time).
Total dollar volume since Sept. 1 is about $21,000, equal to a normal day worth of trading prior to
that date.

Even after the Securities and Exchange Commission opened an
investigation in June 2005 and even after it sued Ellis in March 2006 to force him
to testify, the SEC let Winsted sell millions of shares every day.8
The Ellis story shows that the penny stock market – the darkest corner
in American finance – also is the neighborhood with the fewest cops.
The rules that Congress and the SEC enacted 15 years ago to protect
penny stock investors were written for a world without online trading, spam and
message boards.
“This case discloses a lot of weaknesses in our regulatory system,” said
James J. Angel, a finance professor at Georgetown University and an expert on
financial markets. “Here’s a guy who’s already on the SEC’s list of bad guys.
They have to go to court to make him testify. And they’re letting him sell stock to
the public.”9
Ellis, 40, declined repeated requests for an interview but did answer a
few questions posed by e-mail.
“There is no story here,” he wrote. “Business(es) start up and close
down all of the time. Do you write about them?”10
WILD, WILD WEST
For 70 years, federal law has required public companies to disclose
“material facts” – anything that might influence an investor’s decision to buy or
sell. And for 70 years federal law has assumed that investors would read these
disclosures.
But a growing body of research shows that most investors don’t bother.
“How much of the general public even knows what a 10-K or 10-Q is?”
asked Laura Frieder, an assistant professor of finance at Purdue University,
referring to the annual and quarterly reports that public companies file with the
SEC. “It’s extremely burdensome. If you’re working 40 to 60 hours, how much
time does (an investor) really have to investigate this stuff?”11
Since taking over Winsted in early 2003, Ellis has filed 90 public reports
with the SEC. Together they amass 7.6 megabytes on the SEC website,
half again the size of the collected works of Shakespeare. Like most
such disclosures, Winsted’s are littered with legalese and accounting
terminology. Some run more than 100 pages.12
In the top tier of American finance – the world of Nasdaq and the New
York Stock Exchange – stock analysts and financial journalists serve small
investors by digesting quarterly and annual reports into a page or a paragraph or
maybe a single word like “Buy” or (far less often) “Sell.”

“Even after”; SEC investigation order was issued June 30, 2005, and he was sued March 31,
2006; Winsted had 18.4 million shares outstanding on March 31 and 1.67 billion on July 30, 2006,
or an increase of 13.77 million shares per day for 120 days.

90 public reports;” I counted each filing for Indiginet/Winsted, beginning with the March 2003
filing announcing his purchase. “7.6 megabytes”; SEC lists size of each filing; I downloaded an
online collection of Shakespeare’s collected works to make the comparison.

But in the lowest tier of American finance, the Over-the-Counter Bulletin
Board and Pink Sheets, investors get their information from puffed up press
releases, delivered via message boards and e-mail spam.13
The informal cops are missing. The SEC is the lone watchman.
The penny stock market is “the wild, wild West,” Angel said. “For the
cowboy who does wander into the wild, wild West, they’re on their own.”
GO-GETTER
Ellis is a California native and an amateur bodybuilder who started his
first business at age 25.14
Former colleagues describe him as energetic and a bit bombastic, a
born salesman.
“He was kind of a Ralph Kramden type,” said Bryan Burlison, referring to
the Jackie Gleason character on “The Honeymooners.” Burlison worked for Ellis
for 1-1/2 days in 2005 and quit, he said, without cashing his paycheck.15
“He spins this swirling, phantasmic tale, and you — and I bought it,” said
Shannan Ryan, who paid Ellis $40,000 in mid 2005 for a medspa franchise in
Jacksonville, Fla. “I bought it hook, line and sinker.”16
Ellis was 29 when he first got in trouble with regulators.
In 1996 the Federal Trade Commission forced him to shut Universal
Credit Corp. The FTC alleged the Huntington Beach business made phony
promises that it could improve customers’ credit reports.17
Ellis switched to selling long-distance telephone service. To raise money
he sold unregistered stock in his company, Norstar Communications.
Official documents show his salesmen cold-called residents, offering
shares in Norstar for $1.60 each. It was a great deal, one salesman explained,
because the shares would be worth $12 to $15 each in a few months when
Norstar went public.18
Norstar never went public. Regulators in Missouri, Pennsylvania and
Colorado all ordered Norstar to stop selling stock.19

Interview with Peter D. Wysocki, MIT accounting professor, Nov. 16, 2006. Angel, Frieder
interviews; Frieder published a paper with the title, “Spam Works,” documenting that e-mail spam
raises stock prices even when the spammers admit that they are paid promoters and that they
are selling the stock.

“California native”; voter registration. “Amateur bodybuilder”; interviews with Bryan Burlison,
July 31, 2006, Dale Smith, Nov. 6, 2006. “Started first business”; the first fictitious business name
I can trace to him, for Fresh Start Financial, was filed in Orange County July 28, 1992, when Ellis
was 25.

The Pennsylvania (April 5, 2001) and Colorado (March 12, 2002) orders were disclosed to the
SEC by Universal Broadband Corp. Sept. 18, 2002, when it filed a SC-13D to report its
acquisition of assets of Norstar. Norstar was described in this report as a private corporation
controlled by Ellis.
