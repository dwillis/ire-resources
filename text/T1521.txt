to audit campaign spending

A growing chorus of Virginia legislators and campaign reform
activists wants the state to audit how politicians spend their political
donations – a system they say is open to abuse.
The General Assembly rejected such oversight this year but agreed
to consider the issue again in 2003. By then, a citizens’ group hopes
to have enough private money to conduct the audits – thus preempting the major objection of opponents.
“Audits, in my opinion, will provide for more accountability,” said
Delegate S. Chris Jones, R-Suffolk. He has led the push for
campaign-finance reforms, such as auditing the expenditures of a
random sample of state politicians.
“A random and thorough review of the candidates selected will
ensure or encourage that proper record keeping is of utmost
importance,” Jones said.

Delegate William Robinson of Norfolk lost his re-election bid in
November, but that didn’t stop him from spending political
donations: Just weeks before leaving office, he tapped his campaign
account to buy a $1,650 chair and $4,633 of merchandise from Dell
Computers.

When you make a donation to a Virginia legislator, it’s common for
the money to wind up in another politician’s pocket.

Last fall, Sen. Russell Potts Jr. of Winchester spent $8,180 of his
campaign funds to buy office equipment from his own company –
Russ Potts Production Inc.
In January 2001, Delegate John Welch of Virginia Beach used $40 in
political contributions to renew his legislative license plates and his
driver’s license with the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles.
Those campaign expenditures might raise eyebrows: Politicians
aren’t supposed to benefit personally from their political spending.
By law, legislators and candidates must restrict their campaign
funds to political purposes.

That’s because state lawmakers give away much of the money that
pours into their campaign finance accounts. Last year, members of
the General Assembly used their campaign funds to make $1.23
million in donations to political parties and federal, state and local
candidates.
That represented 17 percent of all legislators’ political expenditures.
Lawmakers gave more money to other politicians than they spent on
political consulting, television and radio commercials and newspaper
advertisements combined, according to a computer analysis by a
legislative reporting class at Virginia Commonwealth University.
