Drones for journalism
Get excited, but not that excited

You’ve seen too
many movies.

The ideal
• Cheap
• Easy to fly -- no training!
• Long flight times.
• Live video! High res images! Data!

Reality
• Expensive
• Hard to fly
• 15 minutes of flight time
• Lift capacity is measured in
grams/ounces

It’s also illegal.
For now.

Soon.
• Congress ordered the FAA to open the
air to commercial drones by Sept. 30,
2015.

• Rules will be proposed this year.
• It’s fair to assume you will have to get
FAA certification to fly a drone for
journalism.

Questions?
• Is this even practical?
• Is this ethical?
• Is this safe?

Wanna see it fly?
Saying yes means you waive your rights to sue me
if I crash it into you. This is totally legit.
