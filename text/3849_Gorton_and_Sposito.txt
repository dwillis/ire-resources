Background Information
Some Basics
● Best if familiarity with HTML/XML
● A way to look at HTML documents
● Not afraid to get into a little bit of code

A bit about HTML/XML
HTML and XML follow the same rules
for building web friendly documents:
Some basic HTML markup:

<html>
<head></head>
<body></body>
</html>

Looking at HTML documents
We need to understand the HTML
structure.
Easy to do with Google Chrome or
Firefox.

The Secret Sauce: XPath
View Raw HTML
● Use Chrome's built in inspector
● Use Firebug for Firefox
Find an XPath with a Tool

FirePath
PathENQ
PyschoXPath
Scraper
XPathOnClick

Google Chrome's Inspector

Questions so far?
We've talked about:
● HTML/XML
● Viewing HTML
● Finding XPath
Next, I'll explain what we can do.

Demonstration
1. Choose a website:
a. City of Champaign, Bid Results

2. Locate XPath
a. Right (ctrl) click on target
b. Choose "Inspect Element"
c. Use "XPath" Extension for Chrome
d. Retrieve results from Console

3. Use Google Docs to load results
a. Demonstration Spreadsheet

Let's Walk Through Google Docs
● Now its called, "Google Drive"
(whatever)

● Free, cloud based
● Very similar to Microsoft Excel
● Uses "Functions" and "Scripts"

Create a Spreadsheet
1. Go to: drive.google.com
2. Click "Create" in top/left
3. Choose "Spreadsheet"
4. Look at "Help" section
a. Check out the "Function List"

What Function to Use?
Remember XML and XPath?
We're going to use the XPath we
copied earlier with the
"ImportXML" function to load the
results into our spreadsheet.

ImportXML
=importXml("http://ci.champaign.il.us/departments/police/police-reports-andstatistics/";"//div[contains(concat(' ', @class, ' '), ' entry-content ')]//ul//li//a/@href ")
Let's break this down into its components:

Component

What it does

=

Tells Google Spreadsheet that a function is coming

importXml

The name of the function

( ) Parenthesis

What we want the function to do

" " Quotation Marks

Contains specific information for the function

URL

Where to find the information: http://archive.ci.champaign...

; Semicolon

Separates the specific information

Xpath

What to look for in the HTML from the given URL

Questions so far?
We've talked about:
● Using XPath
● Creating a Google Spreadsheet
● Spreadsheet Functions
Next, we'll see some examples

Examples
Champaign City Website
●

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArTSE1h9T9A5dERRY24xclk5S2ljWHVHYWVTcVBXYkE#gid=2

Create Notifications
1. Tools > Notification Rules > Set the Criteria and Save
2. Create a script to run the ImportXml function every hour
a. Tools > Script Editor
b. If first time, choose blank canvas
c. Give a name
d. Write a script to run the function - example on next slide

Checking a function script
This is a very crude script to activate a sheet and a
specific cell within a spreadsheet:
function runFunction() {
var ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();
ss.setActiveSheet(ss.getSheets()[1]);
ss.B3;
}
// [1] is the sheet position, in order of 0,1,2,3,...
// B3 is the cell
script location
