BEFORE YOU GET STARTED:
Do not take it for granted that these people are
stupid thugs under the orders of Nazis.
Some of them are stupid, and some are true
totalitarians. But they also have ideas, and
energy. They are not just selling hate: They are
selling utopias.
They also have a culture – a counter-culture, like
1968 in reverse. To understand the party you
must understand the culture.
Do not look for secrets. Look for what is on the
surface, and next to the surface. When you know
that, you will guess the secrets.

Typical Structure of an
Extreme Right Movement
The Party

Satellites:
Vets, AntiAbortion,
Etc.

Allies: Skins,
Churches,
Etc.

Party
Functions:
Elections,
Ideology,
Etc.

PARTY POLITICAL HIERARCHY:

Party Congress
(elects bureau)
Political Bureau: Candidates
chosen by leader
LEADER

Crucial technique: Target bureau or congress
members as key sources

The Party (1): Executive Power:
üTypically based around the founder and
his/her chosen companions: Difficult to
penetrate!
Key to Coverage: Leaders’ pronouncements
are coded toward different party segments!
üClose control of communications, strategy,
and especially finances.
Key to Coverage: Key revenues will come from
public sources (campaign funds, electoral office
salaries and office budgets, etc.)

The Party (2): Operations
Structured functionally: units indicate what party
considers important!
Elections

Administration

Education

Ideology, Propaganda,
Publications, Formation

Youth Movements

Key technique:
Cover a sector you
Already know first!

IMPORTANT:
Duplicate units/functions
indicate party divisions.
Crucial techniques:
üRead the publications of every unit
üID links between unit leaders and hierarchy
Ex: In FN pre-1998, Bruno Mégret (pagan) held
Formation/ideology, Bernard Antony (integrist
Catholic) held culture and education….

The Satellites
Militant circles that recruit adherents
and sympathizers, not always in party name.
Tendency to seek publicity = bulletins!

Examples:
Elderly and the retired
Issue-oriented groups (taxes, farmers)
Teachers and parents associations
Anti-abortion/pro-natalist groups…
CRUCIAL:
üID NON-PARTY MEMBERS!
üSATELLITES SHARE MEMBERS!

ENTRISTS
Some militant groups practice “entrism”:
They join the movement in order to influence
its future direction while maintaining an
independent outside structure.

Examples: Nouvelle Résistance, CDCA,
various pagan groups
WARNING: THESE GROUPS TEND TO BE
PARTICULARLY RADICAL, INCLUDING
THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARD VIOLENCE

Foreign Allies
Most extreme right groups maintain links to
similar (or more extreme) parties abroad.
These links serve to:
Develop independent power bases
(example: both Antony and Mégret had
independent links to East European parties)
Take actions abroad that are illegal at home
(example: FN members used “friends” in
Hungary to promote revisionism)
Crucial technique: Follow research by groups
opposed to anti-Semitism

Tools for penetrating
movement strategy (1):
Key Resource: Party literature
üMarching orders and ideological shifts
üImportant organizational events
üCalendars of militant activity
üNames and activities of militants

Of Particular Interest:
üParty bulletins give instructions for militant
activity, structural shifts that show strategy
üWhere to Get It: Party headquarters

Tools for penetrating
movement strategy (2):
Digging Deeper
Key Resource:
Bulletins and newsletters of currents
Pay particular attention to attacks on
other currents
Identify and contact authors
Bulletins and newsletters of « friends »

Tools (3): The Internet
The MORE marginal the sub-group, and the
YOUNGER its members, the MORE likely they
are on the Net.
VERTICAL Search Strategy:
üIdentify nodes of sympathy through
keyword search

HORIZONTAL Search Strategy:
üIdentify links through site exploration
üConfirm links through content
SAVE ALL RELEVANT PAGES. THESE SITES
ARE OFTEN ILLEGAL AND VANISH FAST

Tools (4): Keeping Track
Clips: Collect Paper and .htm files:
ü Subjects of party interest (immigration…)
ü names of militants
ü chronologies of events (trials, judgements,
demonstrations, elections)
ü opponents' reports

2) Books and Journals
Regularly buy materials at party gatherings

3) Interviews
Record all conversations with party militants
and their opponents
WHEN IN DOUBT, DON'T THROW IT OUT!

NECESSARY PRECAUTIONS
DO NOT publish your address/phone.
DO NOT give in to party militants ON
ANYTHING without negotiating.
DO NOT socialize with movement people
outside of movement events or spend all of
your time with them.
DO NOT attempt to infiltrate a group under
a false identity.
DO NOT go to events alone if you have
been threatened.
EXPECT your beliefs to be challenged.
ALWAYS give and demand respect.

If you get scared…
Listen to your fear.
Fear is a loyal friend. It will not leave
you as swiftly as courage. And it will tell
you what you are afraid of. If someone
in this movement scares you, learn why.
Treat your emotions as information.
Note them carefully, as you would note a
conversation with a source.
