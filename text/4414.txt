Science
Using Python in the newsroom.

Why Python?
Many seasoned data reporters have spent years mastering tools
like Excel, Access or Re¿ne to clean and analyze data. Allow us to
explain why Python can replace all of those tools and make your
work faster, easier and better. »

Introduction to the Tools
Every new discipline has tools that you need to be familiar with
to get started. Those tools in Python are Anaconda and IPython
Notebooks. This section introduces you to those tools. »

Introduction to Data Science ­ Using Python in the newsroom

Pandas, Python's data analysis library, is where you're going to
spend most of your time manipulating and interrogating data.
This section introduces to its core concepts and shows you have
to do some of the things you're probably already familiar with in
spreadsheets. »

Pandas, Digging Deeper
Now that you've got your feet wet with Pandas, it's time to dig
into some of the features that you can't do with spreadsheets.
This section shows you how to clean-up, transform, and ask hard
questions of data. »

Visualization: Showing Your Work
So far we've dealt with raw data and output it mostly in tabular
form. Visualizations provide an entirely new understanding of the
data, one that might not be obvious from plain tables. This
section introduces you to matplotlib and bokeh, two of the tools
that let you turn you data into plots and charts.
