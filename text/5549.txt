WED

(WRITING, EDITING & DESIGN)

MARCO GARCIA (Senior Adviser on News Design/Adjunct Professor at the Columbia Journalism
School who teaches Multiplatform Design & Storytelling)
•

“a true renewal of the nuptials between writing, editing and design (WED), in which the
designer returns to his/her journalist roots”

•

linear narrative with video, infographics and other visual elements that create a tangible
experience for the reader

•

“Through this method we transport readers to the heart of the story, be it a walk through the
streets of a war-torn city or the site of a massive fire in midtown. Whatever the scene, a
successful application of WED not only makes it easier for the reader's eyes to move from the
top to the bottom of the screen to follow the story, as we normally do when we use our phones
and tablets, it also creates a sort of virtual experience.”

HOW CAN WE INCORPORATE THESE
CONCEPTS OURSELVES?
• Pushing the boundaries of “traditional” journalism
• Strategizing at the beginning of the reporting phase

• Various elements should stand alone
• What audience am I trying to reach?
