IRE Conference – June 2019

I work for APTN Investigates, a half hour documentary series on Aboriginal Peoples Television
Network.
In Canada, the Indian Act is the overarching legislation that governs Indigenous people. There
are over 600 First Nations across the country. We have Metis, Inuit, and First Nations people.
First Nations is a catchall term for Aboriginal people, which includes different nations such as
Mi’kmaq, Cree, Dene, Anishinaabe, Haida just to name a few.
Indigenous people make up approximately 4.1% of the population. But according to Statistics
Canada, Aboriginal adults make up 28% of admissions to provincial/territorial correctional
services and 27% for federal correctional services.
Aboriginal women make up 41.4% of the female federal prison population in Canada.
BEFORE YOU START;
1.​ ​Know your history. Indigenous people are the first peoples who are living with the ongoing
impacts of colonization. That experience will differ for different tribes or nations, so be aware of
the Indigenous history wherever you are reporting.
2.​ ​Know your treaties. The map of North America is also a map of treaties the crown or
colonial governments signed with Indigenous Nations dating back to the 1700s. These are not
documents of the past but legally binding (though often broken), living documents that still
matter today.
3.​ ​That history will inform your understanding and coverage of current events/issues that
impact and are important to Indigenous people – from justice to pipelines to powwows.
BUILD TRUST;
1.​ ​Make connections…make phone calls. Just start talking to people. They won’t all be
sources or formal interviews but they’ll help you know who’s who and usually lead you to the
best person to talk to.
2.​ ​The best way to build trust is to start doing stories. If you’re parachuting in to do just one
story…maybe rethink that strategy.
3.​ ​When you’re on the ground in a community…stay. If you’re doing an investigative story on
Indigenous issues, ten to one, you’re not fighting off other media to get the scoop. So take some
time with people.
4.​ ​I’ve often heard frustration from Indigenous people that they were taken out of context by
mainstream media. Don’t do that :-)
