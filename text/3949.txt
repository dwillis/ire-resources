Unfortunately, the contract won’t tell you which
other companies bid on the award.

A few more databases
 SAM: https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM
Search basic records for all contractors and look up
suspended and debarred contractors
 Small Biz:
http://dsbs.sba.gov/dsbs/search/dsp_dsbs.cfm
Search records of small business contractors
 Protests:
http://www.gao.gov/legal/bids/bidprotest.html
Search GAO bid protest records

 Sorry, there’s no good database for subcontracts!
