Fatal Accident Reporting System
DOT truck accident, inspection and census data
Federal bridge inspections
Boat registrations and accidents
FAA accident and licensing data
Hazardous materials carriers

From the IRE Resource Center (www.ire.org/resourcecenter)
Tipsheet #2683: David Barnes of the DOT Office of Inspector General.
#23034, Tampa Tribune: This series investigated the TampaHillsborough County Expressway Authority that prompted an
investigation by Governor Jeb Bush's office, an investigation by the
Florida Legislature's Auditor General and an ongoing investigation by
the FBI.
#23077, Legal Times: According to reports by the Department of
Transportation and the Amtrak inspector general, it turns out that
Congress was found to have mismanaged $100 millions in legal fees.
This can be seen in how Manatt, Phelps, & Phillips benefited after a firm
partner went to work in Amtrak's legal department.
#22667, Oakland Tribune: This investigation of the Bay Bridge centered
on allegations made by 20 welders who worked on the construction of a
new Bay Bridge span -- the largest ongoing transportation public works
project in the country. The workers alleged they were pressured to
conceal substandard welds in the bridge's foundations and that they
witnessed the contractor concealing injuries from health and safety
regulators.

When it comes to accidents and infrastructure, data exists at all levels of
government to help you examine the issues. None of these databases is
perfect, but each can help you report on everything from car accidents
to bad bridges.

Vehicle accidents
Federal Data:
1. FMCSA: Truck accidents, truck census
Truck Inspections
2. NHTSA: Federal Accident Reporting System (FARS)
3. FMCSA: Large Truck Crash Causation Study
State/Local Data:
1. Accidents
2. Inspections
3. Compliance reviews
4. Complaints
5. Census/registration

Infrastructure:
Bridges: Federal and state bridge inspection data.
Roads: Highway repair data. Look in accident data to see if bad roads
caused accidents.
Railroads: Federal Railroad Administration data on accidents can be
queried online or downloaded. (safetydata.fra.dot.gov) It also includes
downloadable data and railroad statistical reports.
Also check out The New York Times’ Pulitzer-winning project on
railroad crossings:
www.nytimes.com/ref/national/deathonthetracks_index.html
Money
Remember that safety enforcement and infrastructure all require
money. As usual, following the money can help you understand these
issues. Here are some places to look:
9

Campaign finance – Who is supported by various factions:
truckers, highway contracts, safety advocates?

9

Contracts – Who is getting government contracts for building
roads, bridges, etc… Who is getting contracts for transporting
government materials?

9

Budgets – How are agencies distributing their money? Is
enough being spent on enforcement?

Transit
Your local transit authority has data on ridership, maintenance and
finances. It must report the data to the Federal Transit Administration.

Road Hazards

The Dallas Morning News

www.dallasnews.com/roadhazards

The News spent a year
examining several aspects of
truck safety in Texas including:
accidents, companies, drivers,
political influence, regulations
and enforcement. The package included video and interactive graphics
to help tell the stories. As a result of the series, legislation has been
proposed to tighten truck safety rules.
Some of the findings:
9 502 people died in big-truck accidents in Texas 2005.
9 9,807 were injured last year.
9 344,000 trucks were registered here.
9 632 state troopers enforce truck safety on nearly 302,000 miles
of roadway.
9 Texas completed reviews for only one of every 10 companies it
identified as the biggest potential dangers on the road.
9 Texas trains prisoners – many with drug problems – to be truck
drivers.
9 A patchwork quilt of laws has created special exemptions for
certain roads and carriers, making enforcement even tougher.
9 Truck drivers die on the job at one of the highest rates.
Tips:
9 Compare state data to federal data. None of these will match up
perfectly because of reporting and definitions.
9 Be careful about trying to map FARS data. Lat/Lon is provided
only in the 2003 data and many accidents do not have that
information.
9 Talk to experts. This data is controversial and complicated.
Make sure you understand it. Keep in mind that the folks who
produce it may not understand it that well.
9 Get hard copy reports of accidents, inspections, etc…It will help
you understand the data
better. If you have extra
time, go out and watch an
inspection. These also will
provide opportunities for
multimedia – and that will
make the bosses happy.
9 Use rates per miles driven
when you can, but it’s not
always possible to get.

Teens and driving: A fatal mix
Chicago Tribune

www.chicagotribune.com/teendrivers

Throughout 2006, the Chicago Tribune
examined the seemingly intractable problem
of teen driving fatalities. The series included
more than 30 stories on the issue – many
running on Page One – as well as spot news
stories on each of the 59 teens killed during
the year in the Chicago metropolitan area.
The federal Fatality Analysis Reporting System
data was used throughout the series, as well as a database of 2006
crashes that the newspaper built from its own reporting. The series
attracted a strong following among Illinois parents and policymakers,
including lawmakers in Springfield who are now debating changes that
would toughen licensing restrictions for teens.
Results:
9 The Illinois Secretary of State created a panel of experts to look
at the issue and propose changes to the state’s licensing and
driver’s education programs.
9 Lawmakers in Springfield are considering a package of
legislation this spring that would significantly tighten licensing
rules for teen drivers.
9 Hundreds of people e-mailed the newspaper praising the
series, asking for advice and requesting reprints and CD-ROMs.
9 The newspaper continues to write compelling follow-up stories
and track the pending legislation.
About the
FARS Data
The federal Fatality
Analysis Reporting
System (FARS)
database is filled with
potential enterprise
stories and projects,
and is also a great
resource to have on
hand for spot stories
about crashes.
FARS is a large database. The national file for 1994-2005 is 2.5
gigabytes, although NICAR can cut out just your state to make the file
more manageable. Collected since 1975 and includes information
about the crashes, vehicles and people involved. A crash must involve
a motor vehicle traveling on a public road that results in a death within
30 days of the crash. The data comes from police crash forms and is
collected at the state level before it is forwarded to the feds.

About the FARS Data
The FARS database (version from NICAR) has three main tables that can
be linked together using an ID field:
9 Accident: This includes information that describes the accidents
themselves, including road conditions, weather conditions, speed
limits, number of vehicles, name of the road/highway, etc. There is
a field for latitude and longitude, but it is not included with most
records. There is one record per fatal accident.
9 Person: This data deals with information about those who died in or
survived the fatal accidents, including age, sex, position in the
vehicle, whether or not a restraint system was engaged, whether air
bag was deployed, etc. Data on the involvement of alcohol and
drugs is very limited. There is one record per individual.
9 Vehicle and driver: This data contains information about the vehicle
make and model, Vehicle Identification Numbers, registered states,
registered owners, etc. It also includes driver information such as
the state that issued the driver's license, prior speeding and DUI
convictions, involvement in prior accidents and more.
Tips
9 Get a blank copy of the accident reporting form used by law
enforcement. It will help you better understand the database and its
limitations. Also, get to know the people at your state's Department
of Transportation who work with this data on a daily basis. They can
be helpful in understanding its strengths and weaknesses, and may
also be able to provide you with GIS crash data.
9

If you decide to build your own database on crashes, spend some
time on the front end thinking about the definitions that will be used.
What age range will be used to define a "teen driver"? Will you
include all crashes, even those later ruled suicides? How much
detail do you want to include on each crash?

9 When working with FARS, always remember that there are often
multiple records per crash in the Person and Vehicle tables. This
can get a little confusing when trying to do joins among the tables.
9 Even if law enforcement or FARS cannot provide you with GIS data,
you can still map approximate locations of crashes. For the Tribune
project, we had the nearest intersection of all the crashes. We took
that and entered it into Google Earth to get the Lat/Long and then
mapped those points in ArcView. The experts with the Illinois DOT
use a similar process themselves.
9 Resist pressure from editors -- and yourself -- to try to say things
about the data when you don't have enough data. One year's worth
of accident data is not enough to spot a trend or say anything too
definitive.
