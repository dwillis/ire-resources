When should you use a survey?
●
●
●
●

The data doesn’t exist or is really bad
There are no public records
You are looking to connect with sources
You want to collect personal stories

Research and write your survey
●
●
●
●
●
●

Talk to experts in this ﬁeld: What information is already out there? What
questions would the expert ask if they were writing the survey? What new
information do you hope to learn?
Identify your sources. Who is answering the survey? Collect and verify email
addresses.
How much of that population do you want to answer the survey?
Do you want statistical signiﬁcance and scientiﬁc rigor? Or a small sample?
What questions are you trying to answer?
Run the survey questions by at least one expert to ﬁnd problems.

Finalize and send the survey.
●
●
●
●
●

Deﬁne your terms. Loose language gives sources room to hedge.
Consider your format: Surveymonkey? Google form? Individual emails?
Decide if the survey will be anonymous or not.
If it is not anonymous, ask who is answering the survey and their title for
attribution.
Give sources a reasonable deadline, with time for you to follow up.

Finding Nurses: Steps I took before my survey
●
●
●
●
●
●

I wanted to know: Where are SANE nurses in North Carolina?
Another question: What agency might have this information?
Filed records requests with 3 state agencies: None tracked SANE nurses.
State nursing board also did not have reliable information.
Searched any recent academic or legislative information on SANE numbers.
Talked to experts in the space and ran survey questions by them.
Collected and veriﬁed contact information for 130 hospitals and programs

Finding Nurses: What happens if they don’t respond?

Finding Nurses: Track your responses!

Finding Nurses: Conduct follow up interviews
● Read responses as they come in and contact promising sources early.
● Did you give an early deadline? You can clarify unclear or non-responses.
● Talk to community leaders if something seems off (and to verify your info).
Example: Cape Fear Valley Medical Center, one of the busiest ERs in the country,
said it had no SANE-certiﬁed nurses. Community response:
“I knew it was bad. I didn’t realize that the number was zero.” — Deanne Gerdes,
executive director of Rape Crisis of Cumberland County.

Finding Nurses: Do you have enough to analyze?
●
●
●
●
●
●

In my case, no
About half of hospitals responded
at all
Many responses were statements
that did not fully answer survey
Map required too much
explanation for a common reader
Limited access to versatile data
visualization
Explain survey methods in story.

Finding Nurses: Lessons learned
●

●
●

Carefully deﬁne terms in your initial contact. For me I should have outlined
exactly what a SANE certiﬁcation means (dozens of hours of
classroom/clinical time, passing exam).
I would have added another question for the number of nurses who had some
SANE training but not a full certiﬁcation.
Speciﬁcally ask for the name and title of survey respondent.

Finding Nurses: Results!
●
●

●

NC General Assembly approved $125,000 for a Cumberland County pilot
project for SANE nurses.
U.S. Congresswoman said she was inspired by our research and has
co-authored a bill that includes $30 million per year for SANE training/pay
through 2028.
Pending legislation at state level:
○
○
○

●

Fine hospitals $25,000 if they charge victims for their rape kits.
In discussion: Require hospitals to have a SANE nurse.
Increase funding to hospitals for doing rape kits.

More is coming (I don’t want to get scooped).

FALSE PROMISES

FALSE PROMISES: Why we did the project
●

●

The factual dilemma: Portland city
oﬃcials said they routinely sent
outreach workers to the streets to
offer resources, shelter and
housing to individuals experiencing
homelessness. In contrast, folks
on the street said they never saw
these workers.
The investigation: We wanted to
know where the truth was between
those two statements and city
data did not provide that insight.

FALSE PROMISES: How we conducted the research
●

●
●
●
●

●
●
●

Sample size: 300 people
https://www.surveymonkey.com/
mp/sample-size-calculator/
26-question survey
Sent the survey to research and
topic experts for review
Tested the survey among those
we planned to interview
Paid homeless individuals to help
us do the survey work (budget:
$1,500)
Made it anonymous
Google forms for data input
To incentivize or not?

FALSE PROMISES: Attention to detail
●
●
●

Survey language needs to be precise and
not leading
Be speciﬁc and transparent with readers
about how research was conducted
Think about data visuals beforehand

FALSE PROMISES: Lessons learned
●
●

●
●

More time training those who
helped conduct surveys
Anticipate how city/county
oﬃcials will react to the
ﬁndings
Manage workers in-house
Collect audio

SETTING ASIDE COMPETITION
North Carolina Watchdog Reporting Network
● COVID chaos of spring 2020
● Launched to cover a lot of ground quickly
● Plan: Ask a series of uniform questions of
all counties/health departments

COVID IN NC NURSING HOMES
●

State refused to share information

●

Anecdotally knew some counties were giving
details

●

Replicated efforts on testing

●

What we learned:
○
○

Uniform Questions ≠ Uniform Answers But that’s OK
Information can get unwieldy and of hand
quickly
