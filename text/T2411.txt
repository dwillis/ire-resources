HOW TO STAY IN TOUCH & OUT OF TROUBLE
OR

A stitch in time saves nine
OR

It’s 11a.m. Do you know where your reporters are?
While your reporters follow the money, you should follow the reporting.
By meeting early & often, you can detect & resolve problems as they arise
& before they’re in print…
TALK EARLY
¾ Meet at the start of an investigation to discuss reporting strategy.
Here’s a sample list of topics I cover during brainstorming sessions with reporters:

9 What do they need to prove in order to publish, & where might they
get the information?
9 What legal or ethical issues might arise in the reporting, & how are
they going to address them?
9 Will information from anonymous sources be necessary &, if so, what
are our guidelines for granting anonymity & using the material?
9 What reporting can & should be done under the radar before alerting
the prime subjects?
9 How early can they contact the prime subjects of their investigation
without jeopardizing information & sources? Reporters & editors often wait

much longer than necessary to contact prime subjects. The goal should be to
contact prime subjects as early as practical rather than as late as possible. This is not
only fair, it’s smart. The earlier reporters engage prime subjects, the more likely
they’ll talk. If they think they might have a meaningful opportunity to shape the
story, they are more open to providing valuable information & making key
admissions. The sooner reporters know the prime subject’s version of events,
defenses & alibis, the better positioned they’ll be to vet them..

TALK OFTEN
¾

Meet weekly while reporters are pursuing a story. Reporters welcome the
opportunity to surface, take a gulp of air & see where they are. Editors need to be there
with map in hand--or risk losing touch & control. We go over what they’ve learned &

how. They bring key documents & interview notes. Sometimes they even take me on
field trips. We triage, prioritize, assess, & trouble-shoot little problems before they
become big ones. We may get the LAT lawyer on the speaker phone for advice on
touchy developments. We revise our strategy if needed. To keep track between
meetings, I stash “minutes” in a separate file for each story.
¾ Ask occasionally for a detailed written accounting. Memos give busy editors
a map of where reporters have been and where they’re headed. They’re also an
important tool for helping reporters organize, analyze and remember the myriad details

they’ve collected. I became a big believer in reporting memos after a couple close calls
in which accomplished reporters completely forgot critical facts they had uncovered
months earlier—and I only tripped across while reviewing the “minutes” I took in our
meetings.

MAKE A LIST, CHECK IT TWICE
¾

During the end game, I make a checklist of every person or entity that
is likely to be mentioned by name or reference in the paper—and make
sure reporters have attempted to reach every one of them….even those
with seemingly innocuous bit parts. Commonly overlooked categories that can
get you in trouble: Donors & recipients in stories about campaign contributions; parties
mentioned only once in passing; references to previously reported stories. I can’t tell you

how many times my reporters have learned something new and important—or even
actionable--by calling an overlooked bit player just before deadline.
¾

My policy: Whenever possible, I ask reporters to attempt to contact or
re-contact everyone mentioned in the story just before publication to
fact-check those sections of the story that involve them. This is great for
catching misunderstandings (last I checked reporters were human), embarrassing
mistakes & outdated facts. This also happens to be an excellent opportunity for them to

get reluctant sources to go on the record or free up additional information.

¾

Prime subjects get the same treatment.
Of course they have been contacted and peppered with questions that thoroughly
address what’s going to appear in the story. But have the reporters gone back to the
primary subjects to get their response to the investigation’s overall findings & thesis?

I ask reporters to go over the story’s major and minor points with the subjects & give
them one last chance to offer additional information, correct factual errors & raise
fairness complaints—ALWAYS with the understanding that we will only make changes if
we feel they are warranted. We can just say no.
There are several advantages to this practice:
 It’s easier to bullet-proof the story, if the reporters know ahead of time
what the subjects’ complaints & attack strategies are going to be.
 Legal problems & blowback are less likely if subjects are not surprised by
what they read about themselves in the paper.
 Offering a last-ditch opportunity to respond is an effective way to get
reluctant subjects to the phone & get them to confess or provide
information they’ve been withholding.
 If you’re about to give someone a big public black eye, it’s only fair.

ADDENDUM: WHEN IN DOUBT, SPELL IT OUT
“Have you done your fact check?” We all ask that question. But if you stop there, you’re asking
for trouble. You may discover, as I did the hard way, that some reporters think that means take
a quick second read before pushing the SEND button. And I don’t mean to single out reporters.
I once partnered on a story with another editor who told reporters they didn’t need to fact check
graphics, because that was the art department’s problem. So, as you’ll see in these sample
excerpts from routine e-mails on due diligence issues, I’ve made a habit of spelling things out….

Subject: Fact check routine
Once the story goes to copy desk, we'll do a fact check. Please print out the most up-to-date
version of the story and the graphics. Check off each fact as you confirm it.
Check all names, titles, ages, dollars, years, relationships etc. against source material or
people. You don’t need to check your own byline against your birth certificate. But you must
check EVERYTHING else. The facts you think you know with your eyes closed are the ones
that will cause us trouble tomorrow morning.
When you find a mistake, please copy the offending paragraph into an e-mail and clearly
indicate what needs to be changed. The subject line of the e-mail should contain the word
FIX and a brief description. Send the e-mail directly to the copy editor with a Cc to me.
Please monitor all changes made by the copy desk. Make sure all fixes have been inserted
correctly. Check headlines and cut-lines, which copy desk predicts will be done by midnight
our time. You’re responsible for catching their mistakes as well as your own.

Next draft

Could you please take time today to add attribution to all information in the current story
memo and send it to me by tonight? We can remove unnecessary attribution later. But I
want everything sourced before you hand off the writing to xxxxxx tomorrow.
Please use [our lawyer] Karlene's rules:
1. Identify the document AND the filer when relevant. e.g.: according to a lobbyist
registration report filed by xxxxxxxxx's firm; according to lobbyist activity reports filed by
xxxxxxxx's firm; according to financial disclosure reports filed by the congressman;
according to the congressman's campaign contribution reports....
2. Tie any allegations of wrongdoing or ethical violations to public documents or
proceedings whenever possible. e.g. according to the congressional record; a press
release on Rep. xxxxxxxx's website says; according to statements posted on the
company's website; according to testimony at a congressional hearing; according to
statements xxxxxx said he provided to authorities investigating the matter.
3. If you have obtained private, confidential, classified or otherwise non-public documents,
identify them as copies. e.g.: according to copies of internal corporate documents
obtained by The Times.

Subject: Deadlines etcetera
As we approach D-Day, I need to get squared away on deadlines and important contacts.
1. Are we running in the bulldog [Saturday edition of the Sunday paper]?
2. What are the deadlines?

3. When do you expect to have "final" headlines, copy and cutlines in place on the pages?
(As the next step in our fact-check routine, I'll print out the page proofs and [the reporter]
will pore over them. The earlier we can get them, the more likely his eyes will be fresh for
the task.)
4. Who are the Saturday contacts, if [the reporter] needs to make changes on Saturday for
the Sunday paper?
5. When will the Web folks post the story? Who is editing the cutlines for the Web photos?
From: [Copy editor]

To: Nelson, Deborah
Deb, the pages are ready for you to print out...
Regarding your questions below:
1. [Yes we are running in the bulldog]….
4. We really, really, really do not want to be taking changes after Friday. In other words all of
[the reporter's] proofreading should be done Friday. He shouldn't even look at the pages on
Saturday or even rethink anything in his head. Seriously. …That said, if something truly
egregious is discovered, call before 2 pm our time....
From: Nelson, Deborah
To: [Copy editor]; [Copy desk supervisor]
Everything is cool except for the Saturday thang. My staff's required to look at the bulldog on
Saturday (they have to do it online here) to spot any errors you or they missed. Maybe it's a
fix they requested Friday that didn't make it into the copy. Maybe it's the wrong year in a
chart that somehow all of us overlooked. This rarely happens but it has. If we find a factual
mistake--and I mean errors not differences of opinion or unclear passages--on Saturday we
should fix it. We shouldn't knowingly publish things that are wrong.
From: [Copy desk supervisor]
To: Nelson, Deborah; [Copy editor]
..."That said, if something truly egregious is discovered, call before 2 pm our time"...tells me
that all provisions are being made to handle major errors (wrong year in a chart is
egregious). We would never knowingly publish anything wrong. So, I think we're all set on
that.
From: [Copy editor]
To: Nelson, Deborah
Subject: RE: Deadlines etcetera addendum
Sorry, Deb, I didn't mean to overstate things. Of course we should fix any errors and be on
the lookout for any production snafus. (For example, we routinely check after the first press
run to make sure all the jumps read correctly.)
