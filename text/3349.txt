Mortality
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

Data obtained from death certificates, via the CDC or local
sources. A few of the different ways to get it:

WONDER
Just by underlying cause, 1979 - 2006
http://wonder.cdc.gov/mortSQL.html
With up to 20 additional causes, 1999 - 2006
http://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd.html
Easy web query system that lets you download delimited text
files for further analysis

Mortality
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

National Bureau of Economic Research
http://www.nber.org/data/multicause.html
National Center for Health Statistics (CDC)
http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/Vitalstatsonline.htm
The full data set, with 2+ million death records per year going
back to the 1960s. From 2005 on, geographic information is
redacted, but you can enter into a data use agreement with the
CDC for the full set.

Mortality
Local coroner or medical examiner

Even in states where autopsy reports are closed
by state statute or legal opinion, some data can
be obtained.
Some keep an internal register of decedents with
limited information that is a public record.

Prescription drugs
Drug Enforcement Agency
State Controlled Substance Task Force/Monitor

The majority of states have one of these. In some, the
information isn't expressly withheld from the public record
either.

"A Sun analysis of a Nevada Pharmacy Board database that tracked all
the prescriptions for controlled substances in the state, not just
narcotics, showed that in 2007, 1 percent of medical practitioners in the
database prescribed 51 percent of controlled substances in the database,
and 5 percent of them prescribed 88 percent of the drugs."

A bit out of date now, but these reports can be mined for
consumption and sales trends down to the first three digits of a
zip code.
