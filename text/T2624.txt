“CAR after the disaster:
FEMA, SBA and other data”
March 11, 2006

The Sept. 11, 2001, federal recovery package included programs and agencies that play a major role in every
disaster, and many that were created on the fly by the city and state. As a result, not everything discussed here
will necessarily have direct relevance to future disasters.
On a general note, it can be helpful to understand something about the politics of disaster funding. In any other
climate, much of what came New York’s way would have been broadly criticized as pork-barrel spending by
lawmakers elsewhere. Some of that was muted by the nature of this particular disaster: The attacks suspended
many norms of political behavior. But it was explained to us several times that lawmakers are always hesitant to
criticize what another disaster-struck district receives because they all believe that next month, or next year, a
hurricane, earthquake or flood is coming their way. Your local politicians are likely to be interested only
bragging about bringing home the bacon, and pushing for more.
Also, watch out for waived rules. At every turn, we found that procurement and disaster funding rules were
waived, or simply ignored without a waiver. That had profound implications on the execution of the aid
package.
Waived rules and reluctant officials can conspire to leave you feeling rather alone as you evaluate whether the
execution of recovery plans actually cures the specific injuries of a disaster.

Getting Started
As with any reporting project, point of entry is the key first decision. Our project began with a casual newsroom
conversation about what ever happened to the $21 billion that President Bush promised New York. Obviously, a
narrower line of inquiry – say one that begins with a tip or an observation or an official audit – would allow for
a more targeted approach than ours.
Which records you use will depend upon the funding stream of the program(s) you chose to examine. Money
for disasters comes from a variety of federal agencies. Some goes directly from the feds to residents, businesses
and contractors. Some goes to state and/or city agencies that then disburse it.

1

The federal agencies that generally play a major role in disaster recovery efforts are:
- Federal Emergency Management Agency
- Housing and Urban Development
- Small Business Administration
- Department of Transportation
Nearly every bit of the $21.4 billion promised to New York came through those agencies. But smaller amounts,
relatively speaking, were funded by Treasury (waived taxes on certain businesses and individuals), and others.
Depending on how long after the disaster you begin your work, official audits and reports might also be
available. We benefited from dozens of reports from the Government Accountability Office
(http://www.gao.gov) and the Inspector Generals of each agency (http://www.ignet.gov/).

Data
We used the following categories of data:
- Appropriation Acts, Press Releases and Quarterly Performance Reports
- Contract Data
- Grant Data
- SBA Disaster Loan and STAR Data
- FEMA Individual and Family Grant data

Appropriation Acts, Press Releases and Quarterly Performance Reports
Our data work on this category of material was profoundly simple, but immensely valuable. Since we were
attempting, essentially, a forensic audit of $21 billion with entries from a variety of sources, it was vital to
organize that material in a meaningful way.
We created simple spreadsheets of funding announcements. Adding our own category codes allowed us to
organize this stuff beyond which agency supplied the money. For example, of the $4.6 billion originally
appropriated to transportation and infrastructure projects, $2.8 billion came from FEMA and $1.8 billion from
the Department of Transportation. We broke that pie into several subcategories, like subway, roads, commuter
trains, and whether the project repaired something that existed before or went beyond pre-attack conditions.
All expenditures of HUD money – about $3.7 billion – had to be reported in Quarterly Performance Reports.
Those proved useful in understanding what the feds signed off on and what the local agencies promised.

2

A close read of the appropriation acts also led us to understand the ways that the funding for this disaster
differed from others. For example, one passage waived the requirements of the Stafford Act. That act would
have limited New York to rebuilding only to pre-disaster stature. Waiving it meant that projects would be
limited in scope only by the amount of money available. It also released New York from having to pay the
matching share of FEMA money required by the Act.
The appropriation acts also showed the intent of Congress. We would later gauge how far some state agencies
veered from that course, especially in awarding grants to small businesses.
The sum total of this data was behind a pie chart published the first day and a list of whacky expenditures that
we ran, such as $250,000 for the Splendor of Florence festival.

Contract Data
Federal, state and city contract data proved mostly useful for power browsing.
City and state records often included identifying purposes such as “WTC.” In other instances, the macro level
detail we had from funding announcements helped us pull out the vendors that received recovery-related
contracts. We also coded contracts by purpose to allow us to drill down categories in the macro data described
above.
The data led to stories about massive counseling expenditures that were used by scores of non-profits for
purposes far a field from trauma caused by the attacks, to mob involvement in the debris removal work, and to
an unknown young photographer gaming the city out of ownerships rights on thousands of 9/11 photos he was
paid $300,000 to shoot.

Grant Data
The quasi public agencies that the governor put in charge of giving away $1 billion in grants to businesses
created their own databases of the awards. We were unable to obtain complete and original data from those
agencies before our initial series began in December. But we had received a copy of partial data from a goodgovernment group that had obtained it more than a year earlier under a Freedom of Information request.
It looked like this:

We received a complete set one month after the series ran that included NAICS codes, reported annual
revenues, number of employees and addresses. That made it easier to identify recipients.
It also allowed us to compare the definition of a small business that the local agency used with the Small
Business Administration’s definition, which varies from industry to industry, mostly using employee counts,
annual revenue, or assets. Federal law requires that all federal programs aimed at small businesses use SBA’s
size standards, or get a waiver from SBA to use a deferent standard.
Our local agency didn’t use SBA’s standards, and HUD, which funded and oversaw the business grant
programs, didn’t seek an SBA waiver. The local agency also largely ignored applicants’ affiliated entities. As a
result, the grants that Congress appropriated to small businesses instead went to the likes of Donald Trump and
Morgan Stanley.
SBA’s web site contains extensive discussion of its size standards at: http://www.sba.gov/size/.
The size standard tables on the website look like this:
Subsector 115 - Support Activities for Agriculture and Forestry
115111 Cotton Ginning
$6.0
115112 Soil Preparation, Planting, and Cultivating
$6.0
115113 Crop Harvesting, Primarily by Machine
$6.0
115114 Postharvest Crop Activities (except Cotton Ginning)
$6.0
115115 Farm Labor Contractors and Crew Leaders
$6.0
115116 Farm Management Services

Sector 21 - Mining

I converted those files into database tables and modified them so they looked like this:

I then joined that table with the grant data from our local state agency, using NAICS as the common field, and
added a logical (true/false) field that noted whether each recipient met the federal definition of a small business.

4

That process allowed me to measure how many recipients met the SBA definition of a small business. But
talking it to the next level, reporting out the examples, showed that those measurements didn’t come close to
capturing the degree to which the local agency ignored the federal standards.
For example, MSDW 140 Broadway Property LLC, owner of an office building, met the local definition of a
small business because it claimed to have only 16 employees on its grant application. The state used 500
employees as a cutoff for all industries. SBA uses an annual revenue standard of $6 million as a cutoff for small
businesses in that sector. So the company’s claimed revenue of $29 million would have made it too big to meet
the federal definition.
But both standards are rendered absurd when you take into account that MSDW 140 Broadway Property LLC is
a wholly owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley, the investment powerhouse that has annual revenues of $7
billion and 53,218 employees. That affiliation would have led to an SBA determination that the applicant was
“other than small.” But the state gave it a $300,000 small business grant.

FEMA IHP data
For one day of our series, we tried our best to do a simple version of the exceptional work by John Maines and
the Sun-Sentinel on the FEMA Individual and Family Grant program. I would suggest looking at his tip sheet
from this same conference for a more detailed discussion.
In New York, that program sought to reimburse residents with possibly dangerous dust in their home for HEPA
vacuums and air filters, and for air conditioners that had been ruined by dust from the Trade Center. The
program was almost entirely run by the state Labor Department.
Hoping to avoid a legal battle in our FOIA request, we asked for only the data fields that it appeared to us the
Sun-Sentinel had obtained. FEMA sent us two clumsy spreadsheets, both with multiple worksheets, looking like
this:

I converted that into a database table and aggregated money totals and distinct number of recipients by zip code.
I then combined the zip code level data with Census files showing the number of households in each zip code. I
created a simple map in ArcView that showed zip codes with the highest rates of recipients per household. (I
used the household rate because money totals by zip code reflected large variations in population differences)
The results showed that people far from Ground Zero and plume of smoldering debris received much of the
money.

SBA Disaster Loan Data
Because the business grant programs proved to be such fertile ground for us, we did little with SBA data. But it
has led to many major stories over the years. See Ron Nixon’s tip sheet from this conference for a more
complete discussion.
Congress authorized SBA to create a special category of loans, known as Supplementary
Terrorist Activity Relief loans, aimed at helping businesses outside the areas directly hit by the Sept. 11 attacks.
The loans offered a better deal to lenders because SBA dropped typical fee requirements. The only advantage to
borrowers of these market rate loans was that they were government guaranteed.
The STAR loans were of little interest to New York businesses because they were eligible for low-interest SBA
disaster loans, and because there was $1 billion in grant money available which didn’t have to be repaid.
