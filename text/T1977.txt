Public records form the backbone of good investigative reporting. They can point you to
stories, sources and ideas for stories. Below is a sampling of some useful records at the
local level. Often, the best articles are those that rely on a combination of different
documents and sources.

GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS
--To find out which people and companies receive government contracts
--To find out the dollar value of a contract and its requirements
--To find out which public officials supported the person of company awarded the job.
Tips:
--Get names and numbers of any people listed in the records.
--Check sponsoring politician’s campaign contributions to see if company and/or owners
or officers have donated money.
BUSINESS RECORDS/FICTITIOUS BUSINESS FILINGS
--To locate filings for business licenses in your jurisdiction
--To find out who owns a business
--To find out what businesses within a jurisdiction a person owns
ELECTION RECORDS
--To find out lists of campaign contributors by amount and person or company making
the contribution.
--To find records of contributions to the campaigns of county or state ballot initiatives
--To find statements of major donors, people or companies who have given large amounts
of money (in LA county, eg, this is $5,000 or more)
--To find out a candidate’s statement of economic interests, records that lay out a
candidate’s income, investments and land holdings.
--To find details on a candidate’s election committee, who is his treasurer, officers? And
who is the committee paying for things such as consulting work and catering its events?

Election Record Tips:
--When poring over contribution records, look for patterns. Se what type of person is
giving. Is a lot of money coming from developers? From lobbyists? From unions? From
special-interest groups?
--Look for hidden contributions. Are husbands and wives giving separately? Do you see
the names of contributors listed at the same address? Are many people from a certain
company giving contributions? Are a lot of contributions given on the same date?
--Always look carefully at gifts or “in-kind” contributions such as food or booze. What
sorts of things is a candidate accepting? And from whom are they coming?
--Always look carefully at a candidates economic interest statement. What is the
candidate’s level of wealth? Does it seem normal? Has his or her holdings grown while
he or she was in office? Are there holdings that might affect a candidates judgment on
public issues?
--Where is the money going—Who are the consultants, caterers? What’s their connection
to the candidate?
PROPERTY RECORDS/COUNTY ASSESSOR
--To find out who owns property in your area
--To find out what approximately was paid for a piece of property
--To learn the details of a property sale (who sold to whom, date, amount of loan, etc)
Tips:
Terms used on documents may vary but often you will see the following:
--Trust Deeds and Assignments of Rent. This is a standard mortgage or a lien contract.
--Deed. This is a grant deed, the standard document filed to transfer title to a property
from one owner to another.
--Notice of Default. This is the document filed if a person has missed payments on a
mortgage or a lien document indicating the start of foreclosure proceedings.
--Notice of Sale. This is the document filed to announce the place and time of a
foreclosure sale.
--Trustees Deed Upon Sale. This document is filed after a foreclosure sale has taken
place. This will tell you the name of the buyer, the date and place of sale, and the amount
the property brought at the foreclosure sale.
--Notice of Action. This document alerts people that a lawsuit has been filed in civil court
that may affect ownership of a piece of property.
--Notice of Lien. This is a claim filed on a property as security for an unpaid debt.
