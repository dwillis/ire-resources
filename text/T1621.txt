1. SIGNS OF A POTENTIAL BOONDOGGLE - Look for delays in public projects or private projects that carry
potential public benefit, such as low-income housing developments or industry that promises job creation, such as a
casino or a manufacturing plant. Change orders on public contracts, re-negotiations, missed deadlines and requests for
more money all should stand out as signs of potential boondoggles.
2. GET THE CONTRACT
- It sounds simple, but get the paperwork. Use the appropriate state public
records law to obtain the contract in question. Make sure it includes all the attachments and addendums, ect. Ask for
all correspondence associated with the contract.
3. GET THE BID SPECS, REQUESTS FOR PROPOSALS OR REQUESTS FOR QUALIFICATIONS. Public
contracts begin with a public process. Even most no bid professional contracts begin with a request for proposals or
qualifications. If they don’t, ask why. Just because the city council can hire the mayor’s brother-in-law’s lawfirm as
redevelopment counsel without a bid or an RFP doesn’t mean it should. Look for consistency in the awarding of
contracts that don’t require competitive bids. Why do officials treat some differently?
4. WHEN A CONTRACT GETS PAID OFF IN HOURLY BILLING, CHECK THE BILLS. If lawyer Smith gets a
$150,000 city contract to be paid down at $150 an hour, get the bills and follow the money. How much detail do they
contain? What, exactly is lawyer Smith doing for the money. How many other public agencies does lawyer Smith
represent? If lawyer Smith represents more than one public agency, compare the hours billed on the same dates. If
lawyer Smith works alone and billed the housing authority for 10 hours on the same day he billed the water authority
for 11 hours, you have a story.
5. IF A CONTRACT ALLOWS FOR A CONTRACTOR TO BILL FOR EXPENSES, LOOK AT THE EXPENSE
BILLS - Flights home every weekend? Lavish dinners? Unlimited cell phone use? Get the idea?
6. WHEN A PUBLIC OR ELECTED OFFICIAL TRAVELS, LOOK AT THE TRAVEL EXPENSES- And if they
go to convention in Vegas and you find 50 calls to local numbers, call those numbers.
7. IF THEY ARE ISSUED CREDIT CARDS - Get the credit card bills. Look for personal items bought and
reimbursed. Compare the times of purchases, if available, to the schedule of official business that led to the travel.
8. START AT THE BEGINNING - When digging into a boondoggle that involves a public project, go back and
look at the intent. Why was the school, bridge, sewer project, needed? Try not to lose sight of the public need. If a
bridge replacement was intended as a public safety project, pursue it as such. Use common sense.
9 USE CORRESPONDENCE AND TRANSCRIPTS TO CREATE A CLEAR RECORD - What did they say and
when did they say it? Compare what was said to what is being said now. Look for flip-flops.
9. CROSS-REQUEST CORRESPONDENCE - Don’t rely on a single source for the correspondence of public
agencies. Request it from both the sending and receiving agency and compare what you receive. Is one agency more
forthcoming than another?
10. BUILD A UNIVERSAL TIMELINE - Use all correspondence to build a universal timeline from the start of a
project through the present day. Build it in chronological order regardless of the type of document. Look for conflicting
documentation close in date.
