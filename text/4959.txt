Javascript vs. jQuery
 jQuery offers a simple way to acheive a variety of common

JavaScript taskes quickly and consistently, across all major
browsers without any fall back code needed.
 jQuery lets you find elements on your page using CSS-style

selectors
 File that you include in your webpage (link or file):

http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jq
uery.min.js

+

jQuery for data visualization
 Why jQuery?
 Libraries include Highcharts, AmCharts, etc. jQuery can be used for

basic charting types.
 Bars (vertical, horizontal, grouped)
 Pies/doughnuts
 Tables

+

A basic jQuery example
1.

Find elements using css-style selectors:
$(.bar.vertical)

2.

Do something with the elements using css-style selectors
$(.bar.vertical).css("height”, “20px”)

+

Multiple bars
 For multiple data points, the each method:
 Selects the element in the matched set and gets that elements

information
 Performs a series of actions on each of the elements

$(".bar.horizontal").each(function(){
//for each horizontal bar do this
$(.bar.horizontal).css(”width”, width +”%”)
});

+

Other types of data viz:
 Pie/doughnut charts
 Useful to show a percent overall as part of a whole.
 Easypie

 Tables
 Useful for comparative data analysis on categorical objects.
 Datatables.js
 HTML/CSS tables

Clustered bar charts

+

Formatted clustered bar charts
 Clustered bar charts can be used to represent two different

factors that are related.
 Survey responses that are related.
 Can be overused, if not formatted correctly.

+

Side-by-side bar chart
 This small multiples layout should be easy to read
 Light gray shading to indicate part-to-whole relationships.
