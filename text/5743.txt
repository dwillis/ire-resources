Investigating Private Landlords

The Story
Outing a landlord with dubiously
legal leases, shady
management, well-covered
tracks and a long history of
complaints

What merits an investigation
of a “bad landlord”?

Serious red flags
● Repeated lawsuits
● Complaints to fair housing agencies, formal or informal
● Lease alterations, lock changes and utility shutoffs
● Unusually high quantity of consumer complaints
● Leases that seem invasive or overreaching

The bigger picture
●
●
●
●
●

Are companies receiving public money?
What are the demographics of the neighborhoods around units?
How many units?
Does the company actively purchase and develop complexes?
How many people in protected categories tend to live in the
apartments?

Records challenges

Problems

Solutions

●

Working around public records limitations
on private entities

●

Emails involving public officials, private
documents made public in court cases,
tenants who kept documents, permits,
inspections

●

Landlords use different LLCs, websites,
and names — so who owns x property?

●

Search agent names on Craigslist and
Zillow, reverse domain name lookups,
public hearings for tax abatements,
Secretary of State business filings
Property records: Combine tax records,
ownership history in county records,
warranty deeds/deeds of trust to find
owner names
City business licenses, state incorporation
papers, state or federal court records,
mortgage records, utility records

Valuable tools

Finding connected companies and properties
WHOIS: Reverse domain/IP lookup and other information, across many sites
StatusLite: Owner, contact information, age
PropertyShark: Can reveal owner information; especially useful if you’re working in multiple unfamiliar markets
Property databases: Parcel lookup systems in your city to confirm ownership; names may differ, but agents and/or
addresses usually the same
Assessor’s office: Depending on how city or county stores data, may be able to get owner information

Citizen Service Bureau/inspectors/permits: Code violations; tenant and neighbor complaints; sourcing contractors
Business filings: State may provide them free of charge, online or by public records request; cities also have licenses
Better Business Bureau: JUST evaluates whether a business is “real” or a scam, but retains complaints and complaint
responses for 3-year periods
