It’s not easy to nurture investigative work amid
the fast pace of daily news or keep a sprawling
project on track while simultaneously
managing the day-to-day responsibilities of
running a busy newsroom. Join us for a
discussion of how to create a culture and
practices that give your readers and viewers
excellent investigative journalism without
sacriﬁcing daily quality.

Create a team
●
●

●

●

Some folks will say don’t do it. Don’t believe them
Involve the team in the newsroom. Put them on
weekend rotations
Go to news meetings. Know what’s happening in the
newsroom
Don’t keep secrets

Spread the opportunity
●
●

●

Encourage tips from beat reporters
Pair them with an I-team reporter if the story
measures up
Rotate beat reporters onto the team when possible

Pay attention at key times
●

●
●
●

Listen to the reporting plan. Stop what doesn’t seem
fruitful.
Demand regular one-page memos
Conduct regular meetings
Keep good notes

Publish more often
●
●

●

Work some smaller tips (and you’ll get more)
Say yes when you can to involving I-team reporters in
a breaking story
Don’t be afraid of the running story: Publish what you
have when:
❑
❑

It can bring out whistleblowers
It can force insitutitions to reveal more information

Manage up
●

Be clear; do not overpromise
Keep them informed
Give them drafts at least 6 weeks out
Demand that they read them immediately
Avoid last minute drive-bys

How to manage daily breaking news
and investigations at the same time
(or the Line Editor’s Lament)

Not much has changed (read this
quote, circa 1993)
“Line editors must be cheerleaders, teachers, critics, planners, confessors,
ombudsmen/women and attorneys. They must spot libel and invasion of
privacy, help reporters improve their writing and newsgathering, negotiate
for time and space, coordinate graphics and text, tame overbearing egos
and comfort wounded ones, and cope with dozens of problems that reach
from deadline to deadline, week in and week out.”
“Senior editors make policy. Line editors give it shape.”
-- Article in Quill by Jack Hart and Richard Zahler

(And everything has changed )

Mornings
-- Check email, texts, Twitter, home page before work
-- Touch base with all reporters in person, by phone or
email first thing
-- Get on the daily budget (Have reporters write their
own budget lines)
-- Establish a predictable schedule – people need to
find you but also know when you’re busy

Meetings
-- Short story conferences with reporters – 5 to 15
minutes – concentrated in morning but really all day
-- Longer story conferences on projects, preferably with
a white board handy (scheduled and targeted)
-- Two news meetings a day with all teams represented
-- Weekly enterprise meeting with fellow editors
-- Graduated project managing meetings to track
sprawling stories

Me time
-- Budget time to keep deadline open
-- Mid-day for enterprise editing
-- Deadline is sacrosanct
-- Block out office hours or the equivalent for projects,
control interruptions

Use a backout schedule
●

●

●

●

Build in deadlines for key waypoints approaching
publication
Include deadlines for supporting players – social
folks, video editors, marketing, all steps of legal
review and even top manager review – and let them
know their window and responsibilities
Be prepared to bust some interim deadlines but
reset pub date if you bust many or can’t get back on
track quickly
Set a Go/No Go Deadline and BE COMMITTED
TO UPHOLD IT

Celebrate victories!
