THE INTERVIEW REQUEST
What is the Plan?
✦
What is your Timeline?
✦
Is a statement good enough?
✦
✦ Should you provide questions or not?
✦ What if the interview subject doesn’t want to
cooperate?

Beware of your approach and
what YOU look like during a
confrontation!

Public Records are one
of your best resources!!

WATCH OUT!!
Keep your eyes open for mis-truths,
even when others are reporting the information as
FACT!

Let Compelling Interviews
DRIVE the Story
Unveil the most dramatic soundbites
throughout the story to keep the
viewers attention all the way through
your report.

Final Thoughts:
Use Multiple Cameras when possible
✦
✦ When someone asks you to get off the property, you have
to leave, or start moving in that direction
Always remember, safety first.
✦
✦ And remember why we do, WHAT we do, to HELP people
