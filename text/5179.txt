Check your State’s Environmental Agency to see what types of clean-up programs regulators
are offering to businesses to clean toxic spills, releases, etc. What are the incentives for
voluntary clean up? What’s required?
How does your state environmental agency handle non-compliance? Records to ask for:
Warning letters, termination letters, lawsuits and public complaints, enforcement action, and
EPA referrals.
Seek out trusted environmentalists who can provide information about the types of poisons
involved and the best ways to remediate them.
Make contacts within the EPA to weigh in on findings and potential cleanup options
Check court records to see if any of the sites have pending or prior legal action. What was the
outcome? Are there victims you can talk to? What are the companies saying about your
regulators?

3) Identify potential connections between the cancer patients and ask your State Health
Department if any of those potential connections have or could be investigated
4) Talk with experts: Environmentalists, doctors, health officials, researchers in your area
