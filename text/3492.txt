Our Focus

– Person, place, organization, phone number,
date, license plate, etc.

• Thesis: A story/narrative/plot/threat

entities in coordination

Entities Identified

22

Tipsheet #3492

Connections

• Entities relate/connect to each other to
make a larger “story”
• Connection definition:
– Two entities are connected if they appear in
a document together
– The more documents they appear in
together, the stronger the connection

23

Tipsheet #3492

Jigsaw

• Multiple visualizations (views) of
documents, entities, & their connections
• Views are highly interactive and
coordinated
• User actions generate events
that are transmitted to and
(possibly) reflected in other
views
