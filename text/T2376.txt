FARS
Â Data span: Collected since 1975 and includes information
that characterizes the crashes and the vehicles and people
involved

Â Criteria: A crash must involve a motor vehicle traveling on a
public roadway that results in the death within 30 days of the
crash.

The Data includes…
Â Accidents: Base table with one record per fatal accident.
Road and weather conditions. Numbers of individuals and
vehicles involved in each.

Â People: One record per individual, including age, sex, person
type, seat position and seatbelt use. Alcohol/drug info is spotty.

Â Vehicles and Drivers: One record per vehicle with driver
info. Models and charges are iffy, but can be checked with
other records. Latitude and Longitude, which NICAR says is
fairly well filled in as of 2003.
