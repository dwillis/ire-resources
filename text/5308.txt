The Biblical Times

The Art of
Investigative Story-Telling:
:

After six days of grueling
work creating the
universe, God rested on
the seventh day, telling
the Biblical Times “it was
very good” and now it
was up to Adam and Eve.

What makes a good story?

THE FOUR BASIC
BUILDING BLOCKS
FOR A GOOD STORY:

ØGREAT CHARACTERS
ØGREAT PLOT
ØGREAT WRITING
ØGREAT ACCOUNTABILITY
(c)www.juliansher.com

• Characters drive your story
üHeroes, Protagonists
üPeople I care about
üPeople I get to know
üReal people who change
(c)www.juliansher.com

(c)www.juliansher.com

#1: Your characters have
to go on a journey
üThey struggle
üThey win, they lose…
üThey discover …
üIn other words – they grow and change
(c)www.juliansher.com

HOW WE TOLD THE STORY OF A YOUNG MAN WHO WAS MISSING FOR NINE YEARS

• Characters need to change on that journey
(even if you have to “recreate” that change)
üIf they are dead, bring them back alive
üIf they are angry, go back to when they were
happy
üIf they are beaten, go back to when they had
hope
üIf they did something bad, go back to when they
were good.

send a Texas man to death row…

The protagonist

»Context
What you need to know
Why you should care

»Conflict
The guts of the story

»Conclusion
What happens next …
the lessons learned
