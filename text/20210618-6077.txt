What we hope you’ll take away from this panel:

● An overview of the FBI national Use of
Force data collection effort (it’s making
progress, but moving slowly)
● Alternate data sets you can source while we
all wait for the FBI
● A “how to” primer on turning a Use of Force
accountability story in your market

NEISS-AIP/WISQARS

National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS)
“provides information about what types of
nonfatal injuries occur in U.S. hospital
emergency departments, how common
they are, who they affect, and what
causes them.”
“The NEISS-AIP data are collected at 66
of the 100 NEISS hospitals, which
represent the nation’s range of hospital
settings."

Black people were at
least 2.3x more likely
to end up in a hospital
due to legal
intervention than
white people

But we still need a national Use of Force
database…
● NEISS-AIP/WISQARS -- is survey based-- meaning only 66
out of approximately 6,000 hospitals in the U.S.
participate (1 percent).
● National UoF data would be standardized - allowing for
better comparisons
● Not all use of force incidents result in death

Results of our questions

-

11 police agencies that did not
previously give FBI use of force data
pledged that they would, following
Newsy questions
4 agencies said they had no plans to
submit data
27 conﬁrmed they had sent FBI Data
More than half did not respond

FBI statements over time...
June 8, 2020:
“Participation will promote transparency and accountability between law enforcement and the communities they
serve…. The ﬁrst publication of the National Use-of-Force Data Collection will be this summer and will be published on
the internet via the FBI’s Crime Data Explorer (CDE) at www.fbi.gov/cde [fbi.gov].”

July 27, 2020:
“At this time, because the agencies submitting use-of-force data represent more than 40% of the ofﬁcers in the nation,
participation data may be released. When 60% of the total ofﬁcer population is represented, ratios and percentages, as
well as the most frequently reported responses to questions (in list format without actual counts) may be published.
When 80% of ofﬁcers are represented by submitted data, aggregate use-of-force data may be presented.”

March 18, 2021:
“In an effort to allow data to be released in a timelier manner, the FBI will publish data at 10 percent national participation
intervals beginning with a spring 2021 release at 50 percent. The 50 percent publication will follow the 40 percent threshold
allowance and the 70 percent publication will follow the 60 percent threshold allowance. The National Use-of-Force Data
Collection has currently met the 40 and 50 percent coverage publication thresholds.”

Participation growing nationally- but actions of
almost half of the nation’s ofﬁcers not disclosed
