Telling the data story with
interactives and on radio and TV

The map as the story

Rolling investigation
• Get the data
• Start with explanatory
journalism
• Get the community
involved
• How taxes are assessed
• Keep peeling the layers
off the onion

How taxes are spent
• 1,000s of invoices
– Consultants
– Garbage disposal
– Catered lunches
– Admin building

Lessons learned
• Slow loading map!!
• Every platform requires different storytelling
• Think about your partners: their needs are your
needs
• Get buy-in from graphics and animation experts
• Break it down
– Radio – tell me
– TV – show me
– Web – multi-media

Anatomy of a cross-platform project: JFK 50
Goal: Create a rich, interactive
experience for our Dallas-Fort
Worth station around the 50th
anniversary of the JFK
assassination.
Questions:
What do we have that nobody
else does?
How can we leverage it?
Who is the audience?

What We Have: Great Archival Video
KXAS covered JFK’s trip to Dallas and Fort
Worth even before the assassination.
That meant we had great video from the
moment Air Force One landed in Fort
Worth on Nov. 21. That includes JFK’s last
two speeches of his life, his plane arriving
at Love Field and motorcade leaving Love
Field just before the assassination, Lee
Harvey Oswald’s assassination by Jack
Ruby, and more.

How to present it: Mobile, Desktop, Broadcast
Who’s the audience?
Our existing Dallas-area readers and viewers, plus
JFK buffs – including expected ‘assassination
tourists.’
How to best reach that audience?
Broadcast can use the best content in packages and
specials, but it can’t leverage the depth of the
archives. Digital platforms let us take advantage of
that depth. We decided to focus the digital
experience on a rich iPhone app designed to make it
easy to consume video and other content from
anywhere – including Dealey Plaza.

Building the experience: Mobile
Two key navigational elements:
Scroll-wheel timeline: Allows user to
navigate through the content by date and
time, following along the events on
chronological order.
Interactive maps: Allows user to follow
events by location. We created two
different maps, one that followed JFK’s
motorcade from Love Field to Parkland
Memorial Hospital, and one that followed
Lee Harvey Oswald from the book
depository to the Texas Theater.

13

Building the experience: Desktop
On desktop, used an
existing template to create
a special section for JFK
content, a recreated the
key navigational elements
using relatively simple web
tools: Veritas for the
timeline and CartoDB for
the maps.

14

Collaboration and organization: Google Docs
To organize all this content
and help us create the
desktop and mobile
experience, and make it
easy to collaborate
between teams in Dallas
and New York City, we
relied heavily on Google
Docs. We used a
spreadsheet to track
content and make sure it
was where it needed to be.

11/22/63: Cross-platform experience
On the actual anniversary, the broadcast team used
much of this content in a three-hour special that
included live coverage of the ceremony marking the
50-year anniversary. The entire show was livestreamed in the app and on the desktop site.
The week of the
anniversary, the JFK 50
app reached #17 for
free news apps in iTunes
– the only app from a
local news organization
in the top 50.

Five Rules of the Road
1) Know your audience, and what platform it uses, and plan your project around
that. More than half of our audience is mobile, but data projects often are not
mobile friendly.
2) Plan ahead. The DataViz person/team should be involved in the project as
early as possible.
3) Use shared tools like Google Docs to stay organized with your collaborators.

4) Organize your data. Even for a project like JFK 50, which isn’t data-centric,
keeping our content well organized and structured made it much easier to tell a
meaningful story.
5) When collaborating on a project, give everyone a sense of ownership.
