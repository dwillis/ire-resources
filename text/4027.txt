I’m a developer/journalist, working on news apps and interactives and stories, but with a strong interest and background in some of these issues, primarily
in anonymity and censorship circumvention. I work on Onion Browser (an iPhone web browser that uses Tor) as a side project.

Threat Modeling

I’m going to just quickly recap threat modeling with a few quick notes.

Threat Modeling
• Why might you be targeted? 	

• Who are your enemies?	

• What might be used against you?	

• What could go wrong in your day-to-day?	

• What does secure mean, exactly?

Threat modeling forms the cornerstone of how you should approach security. If you’re a beginner in journalism, you’re usually told that you should answer
the 5 W’s — or at least consider them. In other fields you similarly have a framework for much of the work.

!

This isn’t a comprehensive version of threat modeling, just my own simplification of the idea.

Threat Models & Threats
• Technical

• hacking, intercepted communications, code-breaking	


• Legal

• legal protections, lawsuits, subpoenas, detention	


• Social

• phishing, "social engineering," exploiting trust	


• Operational

• mistakes happen, do you have a backup plan?	


• Physical

• theft, network taps, torture

So, threat modeling is basically a framework for thinking about your security: What should I worry about and what can I do about it? And it makes
answering that *overall* question easier by breaking down the situation.

I’m mostly going to talk about *technical* protections from here on out. But you should understand that tools are only part of the puzzle. Encryption is like
locking your door. Locking your door doesn’t solve everything: most of the time you assume there are legal protections that deter break-ins and you may
have insurance for your belongings (operational security!). These all work in tandem to protect you.

1: Basic Protection
• Software updates 	

• Antivirus / antispyware	

• Disk encryption	

• Deleting files securely	

• Passwords
This is really “step zero” since these represent low-hanging fruit that can help A LOT.

Software updates,
Antivirus/antispyware
• If your system is compromised, no

password, no communication tool, and no
encryption can help you. Assume all is lost.	


• Security holes in Windows, Mac, Linux —
and most software in general — are
discovered on a near-daily basis.

(lost to random hackers, government entities, corporate spies, shady subjects you’re reporting on)

Full Disk Encryption
• Protects your files when your computer is
turned off.	


• Operating systems come with this now:
FileVault (Mac), BitLocker (Windows),
dm-crypt (Linux)	


• Other solutions:

TrueCrypt (Windows)

People think about e-mail encryption, encrypted phone calls, etc. but that just protects data “in motion”. You need to also protect that data “at rest”.

!
Without full-disk encryption, someone can rip the hard drive out of your computer, plug it into another computer, and copy everything over.
!
Full disk encryption is great, because it’s relatively easy to set up these days *and* it rarely results in noticeable slowdowns.
!

As long as your computer is shut down, it prevents someone from turning your computer on and copying your hard drive. Access to your files is
impossible until you enter your password. Even if you’re not concerned about specific threats, you should do this to protect yourself if your laptop is stolen
at random.

Secure Deletion
• “Delete” normally means “delete from the
table of contents”: data is still on the hard
drive until something else needs to use
these unused parts of your drive.	


• Secure Delete files

Eraser (Windows), srm (Linux),
and it’s built-in on Mac	


• Wipe unused space

Disk Utility (comes with Mac), CCleaner

If you have FDE, this is less of an issue, but every bit helps. This also affects thumb drives, in case you were transporting something sensitive.

!

Wiping unused space helps if you didn’t delete

Passwords
• Stop using the same password everywhere.

Not every website is as secure as your bank
or your work e-mail account.	


• Every other website has an “I forgot my

password” feature that e-mails you.Your
e-mail password is the key to the kingdom.

Two things to remember about passwords.

Password Managers
• Let you generate truly random passwords
(like “0d1Tc1G60y84gPQ5s”) for every
website, remembers it, fills it for you.	


• 1Password (Mac, iOS, Windows)	

• KeePass (multiplatform)	

• LastPass (web based, multiplatform)
I’m not going to go over these, but you should look into them. Most of them sync online, either via Dropbox or via a third-party service -- generally
assumed to be safe since the password manager encrypts everything. I personally use 1Password.

!

You’ll need to make sure that the password you choose to lock *this* up is something that you’ll remember and something that’s secure.

Using four or more words, even all lower-case, even without numbers or symbols, is stronger than most “hard” passwords.

Password Managers	

(low tech)
• Diceware — roll dice to pick words from a
very big dictionary.	


• Write it down if you have to. Really.

(Destroy once you have it memorized.)

Don’t be afraid to write down a password.

!

Writing down an incredibly strong password and keeping it in your wallet (until you have it memorized) is better than giving up and using “12345”. Just
don’t stick it up next to your monitor.

Communications
• Tor	

• OTR (“off the record”) encryption for
instant messages	


• Encrypted voice calls	

• PGP encryption for e-mail & files

Public Key Encryption
• You and a person you are communicating

with can generate a secret encryption code
known to only you two.

Tor
• Anonymizes your internet connection so
websites don’t know where you are	


• Bounces your web traffic through other
computers before it actually hits the
internet

Tor

https://www.torproject.org/about/overview

“How Tor Works” video | Interactive "Tor & HTTPS Demo"

Tor
• Windows/Mac/Linux

torproject.org
“Tor Browser Bundle” is a special version
of Firefox that connects through Tor.	


• Android

orbot (Guardian Project)	


• iOS

Onion Browser
(disclosure: I work on this)

OTR Encryption
• Uses an instant messaging program to

encrypt communications between you and
another person over an existing instant
messaging service (like Google Chat).

Anybody use Adium/Pidgin? Trillian or AOL instant messenger or ICQ back in the day? OTR basically uses a chat program on top of an existing chat
network like Google Chat.

Note that the metadata (who I’m are talking to and when the message are sent) are still known by Google.

!

OTR also doesn’t anonymize if you’re using an existing account with your name on it.

OTR Encryption
• Mac:

Adium	


• Windows, Linux:

Pidgin + OTR plugin	


• You can use Google Talk, AIM, MSN
Messenger, Yahoo Messenger, etc.	


• Or register a Jabber/XMPP account on any
provider: http://www.jabber.org/

Encrypted Voice Calls
• Most systems similar to OTR, but for voice
calls on both computers and cell phones.	


• Ostel, a Skype-like voice chat provider
operated by the Guardian Project	


• Supports software for computer

platforms, Android, iOS, and Blackberry.	


• RedPhone (Android)	

• Silent Circle ($, multiplatform)

PGP
• Also known as GPG — for “GnuPG”, the

most popular software that implements this
type of encryption	


• Identity verification & tamper-protection	

• Encryption

PGP stands for “pretty good privacy” and is currently the gold standard for e-mail encryption. It’s been around since the mid-90’s and has been wellstudied for security flaws, and because of this it’s well-regarded in cyber security circles.

PGP
• Mac:

GPGTools' GPG Suite + Thunderbird +
Enigmail	


• Windows:

GPG4Win + Thunderbird + Enigmail

Advanced Topics
• Tails secure operating system	

• Tor hidden services
• SecureDrop

SecureDrop is an example of a Tor hidden service — a software package now maintained by the Freedom of the Press Foundation

Tails
• https://tails.boum.org/	

• A totally isolated operating system that

uses Tor for all network activity, comes with
many secure communication tools, and
leaves no trace of use on the computer
when you’re done.	


• Download, then burn onto a DVD or install
onto a USB.

Tor Hidden Services
• Anonymous websites that use Tor in such a
way that the website is also difficult to
trace. All traffic stays within Tor, providing
maximum protection to both parties.	


• Instead of “example.com” addresses are 16
random characters and “.onion”.
(“3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion”)	


• WikiLeaks, “Silk Road” drug market
Onion site listed is a hidden service mirror for the DuckDuckGo search engine.

SecureDrop
https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/securedrop

• Tor hidden service.	

• Whistleblower-to-Journalist messaging and
submission system.	


• Maintained and supported by the Freedom
of the Press Foundation.	


• Used at The New Yorker, Forbes, others
The proliferation of SecureDrop installations is a good indicator of journalists and security professionals collaborating.

Nothing is
perfectly secure.
!

Everything can be
broken eventually.
While I can vouch for most of the tools I’ve listed off here (and linked — if you’ve downloaded these slides), things change very rapidly in technology and
especially in the security space.

!

New breakthroughs in computer hardware and cryptographic math can render these technologies obsolete very quickly.

Humans are insecure

http://xkcd.com/538/

Cryptography and security can’t help you if you’re in a situation where you can be coerced to hand over your stuff.

!

But outside of security, humans are also insecure in a lot of other ways that break security.

“Only amateurs attack
machines; professionals
target people.”	

— Bruce Schneier

Humans are insecure

Sources are insecure. In many cases, if a sensitive source needs to contact you, whatever puts them in hot water has already happened.

!

Be responsible and don’t overpromise based on the tools you’re using.

Other things to
think about
• Do you need to communicate electronically
or over the phone in the first place?	


• Everything electronic is logged in some way;
your computer, ISP, website, telephone
provider, chat provider, e-mail provider, etc.	


• Cell phone behavior, burner phones	

• When in doubt, store nothing.
Think about the threat model before you start thinking about the tools. Technical, legal, social, operational, physical aspects.
