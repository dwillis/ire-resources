Local surveys by employer groups
From a story about a local bakery...

“Fewer people are visiting on Saturdays to spontaneously buy cakes for, say, a party that night. Some who

people are stopping in for individual items, like one cookie or cinnamon roll.”

How is the behavior of people and organizations changing because of changes in economic
conditions?
