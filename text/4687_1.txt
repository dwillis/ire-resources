HUMANIZING NUMBERS

Reporting question: Are kids being sent to jail for
unpaid fines?
●
●
●
●

We started with sources — defense attorneys, advocates, legal scholars.
Learned that Texas treated truancy as a criminal offense.
Advocates said it was possible that kids went to jail for unpaid truancy fines
— but they had no idea how often.
An added challenge — juvenile court records are sealed.

Jail records kept by the largest counties

Here are the details of how we analyzed jail data from a related story.

Talking to kids we identified in jail records led us to John
Payton, a judge working in the suburbs of Dallas.

Some datasets for finding real people
● Inmate data from jails to report on judges, schools, police, and for
backgrounding people
○ What are the most common charges per judge?
○ What is the most common charge for people under 20?
● Pension data to find former employees
● Birth records (i.e. Ancestry.com for finding the parents of juveniles.
Young people tend to be harder to find on Lexis Nexis, but you can
usually find their parents)

Gateway to Gridlock by Louise Kiernan, Chicago Tribune

“The air smells as if it has been inhaled and exhaled by too many people
for far too long and they are breathing it still, snoring and snuffling,
sighing and murmuring as they sprawl about O'Hare International
Airport like refugees from some invisible war.
Everywhere you look there are bodies. Stretched along tables and the
conveyor belts of x-ray machines. Curled up on baggage carousels,
slumped against walls and draped along benches.”

The perfect payday by Charles Forelle and James Bandler, Wall Street Journal
“On a summer day in 2002, shares of Affiliated Computer Services Inc. sank to their lowest
level in a year. Oddly, that was good news for Chief Executive Jeffrey Rich.
His annual grant of stock options was dated that day, entitling him to buy stock at that
price for years...

Just lucky? A Wall Street Journal analysis suggests the odds of this
happening by chance are extraordinarily remote — around one in 300 billion.
The odds of winning the multistate Powerball lottery with a $1 ticket are
one in 146 million.”

Here’s a bad one (I helped write it, so I can say that).

Just look at the headline.

Data explainers
Use simple language — don’t let a sophisticated analysis make you lazy.
How we identified the nation's worst charities
“The United States is home to roughly 1.6 million tax-exempt organizations.
That’s far too many to examine closely. So the Tampa Bay Times and The Center
for Investigative Reporting used data collected by the nonprofit charity tracker
GuideStar USA to narrow the pool to the 5,800 charities nationwide that report
paying professional solicitation companies to raise donations.”
