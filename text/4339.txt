Medicare Part B Payment to Doctors – pulling apart the details
Data released April 2014 and likely to be released every year
hĥp://www.cms.gov/Research‐Staĕsĕcs‐Data‐and‐Systems/Staĕsĕcs‐Trends‐and‐Reports/Medicare‐Provider‐Charge‐
Data/Physician‐and‐Other‐Supplier.html
Data has procedure codes. There is a Relaĕve Value Unit formula that shows the reimbursement calculaĕon for each
procedure as set by CMS. The payment formula is made up of three components:
● doctor work
● facility overhead
● malpracĕce premium reimbursement
You can download the procedure price spreadsheet with instrucĕons on calculaĕons at
hĥp://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare‐Fee‐for‐Service‐Payment/PhysicianFeeSched/index.html
total‐amount = (doctor‐share + facility‐overhead + malpracĕce ) * price‐conversion factor.
To pull apart the amounts paid to doctors, we do not need the conversion factor. The payments listed in the Part B data
can be parsed by proporĕons
Doctor‐work
_____________________________
doctor‐work + facility‐overhead + malpracĕce

= doctor percentage

You can then mulĕple the doctor‐percentage for that procedure to the payment for that procedure to get the doctor‐pay
for that procedure. You can do the same thing with the overhead and malpracĕce porĕons.
Complicaĕons:
Facility overhead varies depending on whether it was done in a facility (hospital) or doctor oﬃce. The Part B data has an F
or an O to indicaĕon facility or oﬃce. So the formula needs a branch that selects whether to use the facility rate or the
non‐facility‐rate.
There’s a geographic adjustment for all three, called gcpi. You have to link to the geographic table (in the download) and
mulĕply each of the factors by the appropriate gcpi so it becomes
Doctor‐work*doctor‐gcpi

+

overhead*overhead‐gcpi

+

mp*mp‐gcpi

Taking those complicaĕons into account, calculaĕng the doctor share ends up like this
case when place_of_service = 'O' then procedure_payment*(
(work_rvu*workgpi)/(work_rvu*workgpi + trans_nonfac_pe_rvu*pegpi + mpgpi*mp_rvu)
)
when place_of_service = 'F' then procedure_payment*(
(work_rvu*workgpi)/(work_rvu*workgpi + trans_fac_pe_rvu*pegpi + mpgpi*mp_rvu)
)
else 0 end as doctorwork
You get the proper rvu values by linking on the hccps code in the rvu table
If you ﬁnd no facility value, then the money is for some other special service that is not calculated as a doctor service,
such as ambulance fees, drugs and some high‐tech tesĕng.
