accounts to journalists. L
​ astPass​ and ​Dashlane​ are also great password manager
options.
Two-factor authentication
Two factor authentication is e
​ xtremely ​important, and adds an extra layer of security on
your accounts that makes it much harder to break into. There are three primary two-factor
authentication options available for personal accounts:
● Pretty good:​ SMS-text messaging. This is least 2FA secure option, largely due to the
fact that the messages are unencrypted, and susceptible to SIM hijack. However,
keep in mind that SMS is still a better option us than no 2FA at all.
● Much better:​ Authenticator application. An authenticator application lives on your
mobile device and generates one-time-passwords for you to enter in as 2FA codes.
Learn more about good authenticator application options ​here​.
● The most secure:​ Hardware tokens (aka security keys). This is the most secure 2FA
option. It’s a small physical “key” that you have to directly insert into your device to
log in. Yubico is one of the primary players in the security key space - you can buy a
security key from them h
​ ere​.
This resource​ will help you add two-factor to your personal accounts easily - search for the
type of account you want to secure (Facebook, Gmail, etc.), and it will show you how to do it.
Check for past compromises
Data breaches happen - the important thing is to make sure you change your passwords for
accounts that were breaches. The following websites are run by security researchers and
let you query databases of breached information to see if accounts associated with your
email address were breached at some point in time. Keep in mind that you likely have had
accounts that were breached - take action by changing your passwords for those accounts:

Threat Modeling
Standard threat modeling questions:
● What do I want to protect?
● Who do I want to protect it from?
● What are the consequences if I fail?
● How likely are these consequences?
● How can I address the most likely risks?
Put these questions into context when assessing hostile behavior online
What do I want to protect?

This generally stays the same: your data,
your physical safety, the integrity of your
reporting

Who do I want to protect it from?

Are there groups or people that are known
for conducting malicious online activity
related to the topic you are covering? Who
are they?

What are the consequences if I fail?

What is the worst case scenario?

How likely are these consequences?

What are these people or group’s
capabilities? Can they mobilize other
groups? How far do they usually go?

How can I address the most likely risks?
