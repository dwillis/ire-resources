Tip #1- Use – Ask who wants to know about
impact and how they are going to use the
information
Evaluation serves many purposes:
1. Program improvement
2. Accountability
3. Program management
4. Communication
5. Advocacy

Tip #2 – Define what you mean by impact
Useful concepts and tools:
• Levels of outcomes
• Outcome chain
• Logic Models and Theories of Change

IRC Definition:
Impact – Change in the status quo
as a result of direct intervention, be
it a text article, a documentary film
or a live event.

Tip #3 - Think through your potential impact
• Conduct an audience analysis
• Why would different audiences be
interested and what difference could it
make to them?

• Helps identify metrics or indicators
you may want to track

Tip #4 – Determine how much impact is good
or good enough
• High profile impacts may not be the
gold standard, they may be the holy
grail:
• Firings or resignations
• Impeachment proceedings
• Policy change
• Criminal proceedings or public
inquiries
• What are the benchmarks for impact?
• How much impact is enough or

Tip #5 – You don’t need to reinvent the
wheel!
• There are existing frameworks that will be useful
• Advocacy literature
• Health promotion literature
• Policy influence literature
• Research use literature

What do we mean by usefulness?
• Satisfaction
• Quality
• Relevance

What do we mean by use?
The “real-world” change that your work
contributed to:
• Hierarchy of outcomes
• Changes in knowledge, attitudes, language
• Actions
• Policy
• Practices
• All the actions listed in the IRC impact taxonomy

Impacts on policy (Jones, 2011):
1. Framing debates and getting issues on to the political agenda;
drawing attention to new issues and affecting the awareness,
attitudes or perceptions of key stakeholders
2. Encouraging discursive commitments; affecting language and rhetoric
to promote the recognition of specific groups or endorsements of
policy recommendations
3. Securing procedural change; changes in the process whereby policy
decisions are made, such as opening new spaces for policy dialogue
4. Affecting policy content
5. Influencing behaviour change in key actors: policy change required
changes in behavior and implementation at various levels in order to
be meaningful and sustainable

Tip #6 - Study “failures”
• If high impact
stories are the holy
grail, then
understanding the
conditions under
which high impact
does not happen
can be informative
for shaping future
efforts

Six Tips Wrapped Up
1. Determine how impact information will be used
2. Define impact using a chain of outcomes
3. Think through your potential impact
4. Determine how you will judge the impact
5. Use existing frameworks
Reach, Usefulness, Use

6. Study “failures”
