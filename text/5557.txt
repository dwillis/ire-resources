Active Mass Shooting
The agreed-upon definition of an active shooter by U.S.
government agencies – including the White House, U.S.
Department of Justice/FBI, U.S. Department of Education, and U.S.
hat
Department of Homeland
Security/Federal Emergency
Management Agency– is “an individual actively engaged in killing
or attempting to kill people in a confined and populated area.”
Implicit in this definition is that the subject’s criminal actions involve
the use of firearms.
For the purposes of its study, the FBI extended this definition to
include individuals, because some incidents involved two or more
shooters. Though the federal definition includes the word
“confined,” the FBI excluded this word in its study, as the term
confined could omit incidents that occurred outside a building.
