Beginning in 2004, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC)
required lenders to report “high-interest” loans in their annual filings required under the federal
Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. These are loans that are at least three percentage points above
the Treasury rate for first mortgages, and 5 percent above Treasury for subordinate-lien loans.
While banks will argue that “high-interest” loans are not necessarily subprimes, which are
based on the credit status of an individual borrower, these 3- and 5-point “spreads” have become
the standard measure for finding high rates of subprime lending.
The database is released annually in September by the FFIEC, and is available from the
agency for $10 at http://www.ffiec.gov/hmda/orderform.htm. The database is also sold by NICAR
at http://www.ire.org/datalibrary/databases/databases.php and includes a Readme for reporters
new to working with the data. NICAR’s data is also available the same day it is ordered.
Since it is large, the database requires use of database manager software such as Access
or MySQL. If you’re not experienced with these, find someone to help.

Querying the data
When querying the data to extract subprimes, these criteria are typical (Found on page 35
of the 2006 users guide. These are for home purchases. Consult the guide for information on
home improvement and refinancing)
Prop_Type: Code 1 for one- to four-family dwellings, including condos. Code 2 for
manufactured homes.
Purpose: Code 1 for home purchases. (Code 3 for refinancing).
Action: Code 1 for Loan Originated.
Spread: This is the field indicating a high-interest loan. Set for >= 3. (Greater than or equal
to 3 percentage points above the Treasury rate).
LienStatus: Code 1 for Secured by a First Lien.
A database query of this types returns subprimes on home purchases. From there, it’s a
simple matter to count the number of subprimes by census tract, and then calculate the percent
subprimes by census tract.

So what interest rate did the buyer actually pay? HMDA does not tell you that, but The
Treasury rate changes daily, so it’s not a simple matter to calculate the rate. The FFIEC requires
lenders to use the interest rate on the 15th of the month prior to loan lock-in date. For example, if
today is June 5, a loan locked in today will use the Treasury rate on May 15. See the FFIEC
spread calculator at http://www.ffiec.gov/ratespread/default.aspx

Foreclosures
The foreclosure story is a natural companion to the subprime story – in fact, with
the subprime business already melted down, foreclosures of properties sold in the
heyday of predatory lending is the story most newspapers focus on today.
Foreclosure data is available from companies like RealtyTrac, which often
provides the information for free to reporters. DataQuick is another source for
nationwide foreclosure data. Also, check to see if local companies in your area sell or
provide foreclosure data. Sometimes they provide the information as long as you don’t
publish it or post it online, but use it for analysis purposes only. If the addresses are
included, analysis can be done by ZIP Code or, with geocoding, at the street level.
The biggest hassle with this data is that a borrower’s name often can appear
multiple times. The process for foreclosure is usually comes in three steps:
 A filing with the local courthouse that puts the borrower and other creditors on
notice that a foreclosure is pending. Usually this comes after about three
months of missed payments.
 The setting of the date for the sale of the properties. In states with a “judicial
foreclosure” process, this date is set by a judge, who also rules on the
amount owed to the lender – including fines and attorney fees. Some states
do not have a judicial foreclosure, where the loan document includes a power
of sale clause that allows the lender to sell a property when the borrower is in
default.
 The sale of the property.
Important: Remember that a database or number count can include the same
borrower at each of these three steps, resulting in abnormally high numbers.
For information on foreclosure laws on your state, contact your local court clerk or see
state statutes. These days there also numerous web sites with simple information about
the law, such as Foreclosures.com
