*Compiled by the staff of ICIJ (www.icij.org), a project of The Center for Public Integrity
(www.publicintegrity.org)
ICIJ, a network of 84 investigative reporters from 43 countries, conducts long-term investigations on crossborder topics such as smuggling, money laundering, and crime and corruption. Journalists are invited to
join ICIJ based on their professional experience and/or expertise in their home countries.
In October 2002, ICIJ began publishing an 11-part online series, “Making a Killing: The Business of War,”
that resulted from a nearly two-year investigation into private military companies, arms smugglers and other
war profiteers. A searchable database of private military companies (PMCs) and their worldwide operations
is also online. The series was published in a book by the same name in early 2003. The following resources
were consulted in that investigation.

U.N. reports
United Nations reports on Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia and Sierra Leone provide
explanations of how international sanctions are supposed to work and how they are being circumvented.
The reports explore the role of natural resources in fueling conflicts and contain information on individual
suspected arms dealers, such as Leonid Minin and Victor Bout.

and multilateral measures to deal with the problems associated with small arms.
