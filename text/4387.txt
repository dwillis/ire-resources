1. Automate everything
you reasonably can
Use BASH.

2. Make your scripts
idempotent
Cleanup after yourself.

3. Never modify the
originals
Treat files as immutable objects.

4. Name things using a
least-to-most specific
pattern
2015-03-06-doj-traffic-stops.csv

5. Test to validate the
original data
Is it what your source said it is?

6. Test to audit your
transformations
Is your file format conversion lossy?

7. Test when you assert
novel facts
Cover your ass.

8. Write detailed logs
It doesn’t hurt to write to several different
files.

9. Script setup and
querying of your DB
Then export back to a neutral format.

10. Follow the crowd
Use CSV for tables.
Use JSON for hierarchies.
Use csvkit, ogr2ogr, jq, etc for processing

11. Define and follow
coding conventions

ly/nprviz-best-practices

12. Store documentation
with your code
In version control.

13. Document the
provenance of your data
How was this data created?

14. Have a setup script
New users should not need to know how
your dependencies work.

15. Be a ticketing zealot
If you find a bug, don’t fix it.

16. Use comments to
explain the why
But your code should never be confusing.

(17?) Be smart about
breaking the rules
