City and School Employee Databases



Get list from each jurisdictions in your area



Ask for first/middle/last names, salaries, date of hire



Ask for department, position, age, home address, and gender



Get data in spreadsheet form



This can help you confirm details about an employee when news
breaks (or in general backgrounding) when many times PIOs refuse to
confirm a person's employment



Have to get this ahead of time, but a great tool to have at
your disposal for breaking news and long term projects.

Under Pressure
Geofeedia.com



Great new website that helps you locate pictures, video, and
other types of media around a particular location



You pick the location, then posts will appear and you can
individually view them. Makes it easy to find pics & video of a scene,
plus contact witnesses



This site is new, but free to journalists. They should be
able to verify your credentials within a day, but better to sign up
before you need it.

+

Under Pressure
Images.Google.com



Not only can you use Google to look for images once you've
started a regular Google search, you can also do a reverse image search



When on the Google image website, just click on the camera
icon & upload your own pic. Then Google will scan the web for other
sites that the image appears on



This can help you confirm a person's identity, see if their
Facebook pic appears on other websites, or find out if a picture is fake
or ripped off of another website

+

Under Pressure
OpenStatusSearch.com



Who needs to be Facebook friends when you have this website?
When breaking news happens, use OpenStatusSearch.com to see what people
are saying about an incident, person, or subject matter



Can be used to find victims, witnesses, neighbors, etc. Just
click the person's name and send them a Facebook message or use your
favorite phone number finder to locate their info



I used this website this week to help a GA reporter find friends
of a fire victim, so it definitely works

Private Companies



If it's a private company, check review websites



BBB (what's the rating like, have there been recent complaints, will
the BBB connect you with consumers?)



Your state's Attorney General and Secretary of State



Yelp, CitySearch, Yahoo

+

Under Pressure
Web Archive (formerly Wayback Machine)



Sometimes right after a breaking news event a company or person will
pull down its website. Use a search engine's "Cache" function to pull up
old versions of the page



Check out http://archive.org/index.php for what used to be called the
Wayback Machine to also get access to archived webpages



This is also helpful to check for longer term investigations if
you're trying to see what a company used to advertise, get old phone
numbers, etc.
