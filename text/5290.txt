My 3 A’s: Anticipate, Analyze & Act
Your hypothesis may be wrong
What’s the reality?
Don't let your passion cloud your judgement: We’re not
activists
Are you missing the big picture? Get out of the weeds
Are your sources truly independent? Connections to source?
Let your colleagues ask questions / challenge assumptions
Who is your devil? Who is your advocate? Who’s both?
Stay organized from the beginning
DISCOVERY!

Become a scholar of your topic
You’re likely not the first to take on the subject

He’s The Most Interesting Man In The World

WATCH FOR HYPERBOLE
It's not numerous if it’s one
It’s not a lot if it’s one or two
“More than 3 insiders told us…”
Did you speak to an expert or experts?
World renowned / authority / expert
Keep your adjectives in check
Can you verify the claim or is it an opinion?

Documents & Data
Data is created by humans &
sometimes nasty ones
How are the records kept? By
whom? For what purpose?
For how long?
Code sheets, layouts, internal
documentation
Always ask; never assume
How current is the
information? Has anything
changed? Policy changes
can result in data changes
but that might not be
reflected in your data set

Understand Your Records
Get help
Scholars / journalists /
advocacy groups
For studies; always get the
methodology
Run it past an outside
expert or better yet
experts
If they won’t tell you, that’s
a big red flag
Sample size
Common sense test
Remember causation and
correlation are different

Bulletproofing Data
Most data needs cleaning
Get the data descriptive stats
How many records? Does that
number match?
Is it 65,536 rows?
Do the values make sense
based on your other
research
Check median, averages and
outliers
A big outlier could be a story but
it’s probably a typo or error
Look for percent change

Explore your Data
Make a copy and play: sort, filter,
noodle
If something doesn’t look right? Make
a note of it
Do an integrity check
Duplicate entries
Null values
Are numeric values actually
numbers?
Nonstandard values for same entity
(“McDonalds”, “McDONALDS
Corp.”)
Identical values for different entities
(Is there a unique ID? If not:
Danger, Will Robinson!)

Data Odds and Ends
Always work from a copy
Use paper records to spotcheck your data
Check results of analysis
against raw data
Try to get the same result using
a different method
Be careful when mixing and
matching data from different
sources (Do they use the
same assumptions and
definitions)

What Doesn’t Kill Your Story Makes It Stronger
Get input from your colleagues, editors and sources
Confront your subjects/targets early on - Avoid gotchas when
possible
Ask people to challenge your conclusions but they need actual
evidence as well
Be skeptical: People lie, data deceives, and our own biases shape
our reporting
Embrace the legal / review process: Don’t fight the people who are
trying to help you
Don’t withhold information from the people who are here to help you
You may still be able to use it if you explain the limitations in your
story

Documents
Get the source documents
whenever possible from
the primary source
Publish the documents on
your website/
DocumentCloud
Can you verify if they are
authentic?
Report the process of
getting or not getting the
documents

Stay Organized Or You’ll Regret It
Create a cheat sheet of key elements from your
documents
Key fact / data / passage you may use in your story
Name of document and source
Page number
Create a spreadsheet for factual claims in your story
Column for source of the information
Column for “ready to publish”
Date column for creating timelines

Document The Process

Don’t forget social media and other content
Teases Headlines Social Videos
Facebook Twitter
Instagram

Are You Ready to Air / Publish
Where does every fact
come from?
Go through your script/
story with a red pen and
double check every fact especially numbers and
statements derived from
data
Don’t rush through the
process - embrace it
We have to be right 100%
of the time - Those who
want to discredit us just
have to find 1 thing
