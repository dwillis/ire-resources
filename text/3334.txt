Bulletproofing an Investigation
1. Make the lawyer your friend. Engage from the beginning of the process. Get to know
the lawyer’s thinking.
2. Forget the “gotcha” approach. Make every effort to engage the subject early. (What he
or she says may actually inform your reporting). Keep a record of your efforts – dates of
phone attempts, letters sent. If the person won’t answer the phone, don’t give up.
3. Beware language bugaboos. Some are obvious “loaded” terms; some are not.
4. Share a draft with relevant colleagues. Good way to avoid mistakes.
5. Follow through until publication. Add last‐minute comments. Watch for headlines,
captions.
