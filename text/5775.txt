Summary​: IRE has given us a nearly complete dump (2002-2018) of messages posted to
NICAR-L. Let’s think about (and maybe even work on) ways to make it a better, more useful tool
for our community.
Github Repository​: A place where we can file issues and discuss things without being in the
same room, since hopefully this effort outlives the conference. There’s a list of ​potentially useful
tools​ that you should add to. If you’d like access to the entire dataset, email me at
dwillis@gmail.com​. Note: you may not redistribute this data.

Questions
● Who is using NICAR-L and why?
○ How often do people who post their first question come back to post another?
● What’s the value of NICAR-L compared to News Nerdery Slack/Stack Overflow?
● What are the expectations of privacy for NICAR-L
● Are there analytics that show which emails are opened?
