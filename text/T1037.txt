Global Investigative Journalism Conference
Copenhagen, May 1-4, 2003
Multinational investigations:
Challenges in doing investigative reporting across borders
Saturday, May 3, 1:30pm-2:50pm
Maud Beelman, mbeelman@icij.org
Director, International Consortium of Investigative Journalists
*Compiled by the staff of ICIJ (www.icij.org), a project of The Center for Public Integrity
(www.publicintegrity.org)

ICIJ, a network of 84 investigative reporters from 43 countries, conducts long-term investigations
on cross-border topics such as smuggling, money laundering, and crime and corruption.
Journalists are invited to join ICIJ based on their professional experience and/or expertise in their
home countries.
While immensely helpful, you don't need to have a global network of experienced investigators to
internationalize your story. Here are some suggested shortcuts, though by no means an
exhaustive list.

Team Up with a Local Journalist
If you don't have a correspondent abroad, try to find a reporter(s) in the country/countries where
you need local research and reporting. If it's a topic that a local reporter has been working on,
chances are good the local reporter will be eager to combine efforts with you. You can track down
good local journalists either by contacting one of several professional associations (such as those
listed below) or by consulting online news sites that publish local media from the country in
question. Using stringers is usually less complicated when it comes time to publish/broadcast. But
if you don't have the budget to hire a stringer or have hooked up with a newspaper/broadcast
colleague equally interested in publishing, you can usually arrange simultaneous release of your
information with good organization and a little trust.

Major U.S. journalism fellowships (Harvard, Stanford, Michigan) host international fellows each
year, and their lists of past fellows might also turn up good in-country partners

News Sites
There are thousands of media web sites around the world and several others that link to them,
including:
AJR has a searchable section on world papers at
http://www.ajr.org/Newspapers.asp?MediaType=1
Online Newspapers.Com at http://www.onlinenewspapers.com
World News.Com at http://www.wn.com
Kidon’s Media-Link at http://www.kidon.com/media-link/index.shtml

government that offers a for-pay database, at reasonable and short-term rates, of translated news
stories from around the world
Foreign Wire (http://www.foreignwire.com) compiles international news from a variety of sources
and puts it into a site that is easy to navigate
Newsgroups on http://groups.yahoo.com/ can also be a good source to help a reporter find
sources or stay on top of a beat
Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (http://www.rferl.org/) limits its coverage to Eastern Europe and
Russia but is a good source on corruption, security and terrorism issues in the region with ongoing
coverage as well as newsletters on specific topics
AllAfrica (http://www.allafrica.com) provides coverage of news from the African continent,
including links to media from throughout Africa

Sites/Databases with International Information
Business/Development
The World Bank’s site (http://www.worldbank.org) requires some navigational study, but in it you
can find some of the best statistics about countries in need (http://www.worldbank.org/data/).The
site also has a special registration section for journalists, which contains statistics and embargoed
material not available to the general public (http://media.worldbank.org/).
To search World Bank projects go to http://www4.worldbank.org/sprojects/. Clicking on
"advanced" search usually produces better and more manageable results. To find the contractor's
name after the search is done click on the project name, then find the link for contractors at the
bottom of the page. Online contract information goes back only to 2000.
The Bank Information Center (http://www.bicusa.org), a nonprofit group, has concise and clear
explanations on how multilateral lending institutions work. Although the site is aimed at social
activists it can be useful for a baseline of knowledge.

the company faces domestically or abroad. You should also check for 20-F forms, which some
companies file in lieu of 10-Ks. Edgar can be searched generally by company name, or by specific
form. The SEC does not require companies to list their foreign subsidiaries. The 10K Wizard

number of employees; annual sales in millions; and a one-sentence description of the company's
products. It also gives the name and contact information for the company's South American
subsidiary. The company also sells information in CD ROM, which lists alphabetically all U.S.
companies with operations abroad, as well as a database that divides that info by state (i.e., which
companies based in Connecticut have operations abroad), by country (i.e., which U.S. business
