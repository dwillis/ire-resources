Basic Stats in PSPP
For NICAR 2016 Denver / Norm Lewis, University of Florida, nplewis@ufl.edu

PART 1: INTRODUCTION
What is PSPP?
PSPP is free software that emulates SPSS.
OK, so what is SPSS?
SPSS stands for Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. It was created in 1968
to allow social scientists (and others) to perform statistical tests. IBM purchased
it in 2009 and renamed it IBM SPSS. It and SAS are used widely for data analysis.
Then why PSPP?
SPSS is excellent. It also costs more than $1,000. So the author of PSPP (the
acronym does not stand for anything) created a free program that follows the
nomenclature and style of SPSS. Unlike the statistics program R, which is also
free, PSPP does not require that you learn a new language. And its graphical-user
interface is an advantage for those less comfortable with a command-line environment.
PSPP is not as competent as its paid rival For example, PSPP misinterpreted a CSV file I
created that SPSS handled just fine. And PSPP is missing some advanced statistical tests.
However, PSPP performs enough statistics to be useful for journalists.
Why would journalists use statistics?
Life is random. What appears to be a pattern may just be chance. Statistics
let us distinguish between a meaningful pattern and random chance. In turn,
that lets journalists avoid mistaking coincidence for significance.
For example, does that cancer cluster have an environmental cause or is it
just bad luck? Are improvements in school test scores the product of a new
curriculum or good luck? Is a change in the local crime rate substantially
different from the state or national average? In other words, are these
differences newsworthy or the product of chance? Statistics can tell us.

PART 2: INSTALLATION
For Windows users, the easiest installation is to download a compiled PSPP from
Sourceforge. The file is about 24 MB. (If you prefer binary packages, consult GNU.)
For Macintosh users, installation is more complicated, according to Softpedia, which has
created an installation tutorial.

PART 3: USER INTERFACE
Open up the data file (with a .sav suffix, just like SPSS). You will see two windows.

This is the
Data
Editor
Window,
used to
work with
data and
variables.

This is the
Viewer
Window,
used to
output
commands
issued from
the Data
Editor such
as statistical
tests.

Basic Stats in PSPP, NICAR 16 Denver, Norm Lewis / Page 2

The Data Editor Window has two views.
This is the data view, which appears by default.
Each column is
called a variable.

What would be
a row in a
spreadsheet is
called a case.

This is the Variable View, obtained by clicking on those words at the bottom.
The types of data are mostly
numeric and string (text).

Change decimal
points here.

Measure refers to
the flavor of variable.

Variables
are listed
in the first
column.

Basic Stats in PSPP, NICAR 16 Denver, Norm Lewis / Page 3

Here is an example of how the Variable View controls the Data View.
1. For the Loan variable,
click on the button
beside Numeric.

3. Click OK.

2. In the
ensuing
dialog box,
click on the
button beside
Comma.

4. Click on
Data View.

The Loan column
now has numbers
with commas.

PART 4: PREPARING THE DATA FOR ANALYSIS
This data comes from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, or HMDA (“humdah”), managed by the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Data are
released in September for the previous calendar year.
This 2014 data is for the Denver metropolitan area. It is for mortgages to buy a singlefamily home to be occupied by the owner. It excludes loans for other dwellings or for
refinancing or remodeling. Several variables were reduced to simply this tutorial.
Loan and Income are numbers that reflect actual values. But variables like Action, Ethnicity,
Race and Sex have no obvious meaning. What ethnicity is represented by a “2”?

What do these
numbers represent?

We click on Variable View to see if these have variables have labels. None do.

None of these
have labels, so
we will have
to enter them.

Where do we get the labels? From something called a code sheet, as the next page shows.

Basic Stats in PSPP, NICAR 16 Denver, Norm Lewis / Page 5

Note the label
is added to
the box.

The process is repeated until all the labels are added. Shortened labels will be useful later.
Then click OK and move to the next variable that needs labels.

When all labels are
added, click OK.

When completed, the pertinent fields have labels.

Transforming a Variable
That leaves just one problem: the LoanType field. (Confession: The LoanType field comes
with a number. I changed it to words to show how to convert string fields into numbers.)
HMDA offers four types of loans:
1. Conventional
Any loan other that the three below
2. FHA
Federal Housing Administration
3. VA
Veterans Administration
4. FSA/RHS
Farm Service Agency or Rural Housing Service
We will now convert those words to numbers.
1. Click on the
Transform menu.

2. Choose Recode into
Same Variables …

3. Click on LoanType.

4. Click on the forward
button to move LoanType
into the Variables box.

PART 5: SCALES OF MEASUREMENT
Before we can analyze the data, we have to understand what kind it is. This involves scales
of measurement, which come in four types.
Scale

Description

Examples

Nominal Categorizes data without ranking;
group 1 is not “better” than group 2

Religion, political
party, sex, color,
national origin

Ordinal

Categorizes and ranks; placing first is Finish order, grades,
better than placing second but
rank in class, Likert
intervals between places are unequal scale

Interval

Categorizes and ranks with equal
distance but without a true zero; 0
degrees Celsius is not zero energy

Fahrenheit and
Celsius temperature
scales, time of day

Ratio

Categorizes and ranks with equal
distance, and has a true zero

Kelvin temperature
scale, age, weight,
distance, money

For now, we can group these four into two: categorical and continuous. Then we can parse
the HMDA variables into these two groups and consider potential statistics.

PART 6: FREQUENCIES
Now we can begin to interview the data.
1. Click on the
Analyze menu,
click on
Descriptive
Statistics, and
select
Frequencies.

1. Click on
LoanType
to move it
into the
Variable(s)
view.

2. Uncheck these four
options because none
apply to a categorical
variable.

PSSS checks these four statistics by default. But LoanType
is a categorical variable for which a mean (and thus a
standard deviation) would hold no meaning. So let’s
customize this list to match the variable type.

Basic Stats in PSPP, NICAR 16 Denver, Norm Lewis / Page 14

3. Scroll
through the list
of suitable
frequencies
options, which
for a categorical
variable is only
sum.

4. Click
OK.

Results from the statistical procedure appear in the Output Viewer window.

Assigning
labels to the
numbers
facilitates
interpretation.

The output would reveal
if any cases were missing
data for LoanType.

Asking for
the sum also
generates
percentages.

This shows that 65% of these
loans were conventional
mortgages while 35% were
from government programs.

Basic Stats in PSPP, NICAR 16 Denver, Norm Lewis / Page 15

Now let’s look at frequency statistics available for a continuous variable: loan.

3. Click
OK.

1. Keep these
four defaults.

2. Scroll through the list to add
Median (usually a better average
for money than mean) and Sum.

(continued on next page)

Basic Stats in PSPP, NICAR 16 Denver, Norm Lewis / Page 16

Scroll through the Output Viewer to get to the good stuff at the bottom.

Let’s explore these numbers in more detail:
Std Dev is standard deviation.
It is a measure of dispersion.
When added and subtracted to
the mean, it marks the
boundaries that will include
68% of all loans in this set.

Std Dev and Mean
combine to reveal
that 68% of loans
are between
$415,474 and
$122,198.

The standard
deviation is 55% of
the mean, which is
relatively large and
an indication that
the loan data are
widely distributed.
But that’s typical
with home loans,
so not newsworthy.

Loans ranged from
$1,000 to $3.5 million.

Median (the midpoint) is a better
average than mean when numbers vary
so widely, as is typical in home loans.

Basic Stats in PSPP, NICAR 16 Denver, Norm Lewis / Page 17

PART 7: CALCULATING A NEW VARIABLE
The frequencies for DenialReason showed that debt-to-income ratio was the leading reason
for denial of a mortgage. This data set does not have debt-to-income ratio as a variable. But
it has both the debt (loan) and the income data. So we can create a variable that calculates
the debt-to-income ratio.

1. Under the
Transform
menu, select
Compute …

2. Enter the name of
the new variable in
the Target Variable
box, DebtRatio.

3. Click
on Loan.

4. Click on
forward arrow to
move variable
into Numeric
Expressions box.

5. Click on the
divide key.

6. Click
on
Income.

7. Click on
forward button.

7. Click OK.

Basic Stats in PSPP, NICAR 16 Denver, Norm Lewis / Page 19

Variable View
shows the
new variable
DebtRatio.

PART 8: COLLAPSING DATA TO FACILITATE ANALYSIS
With home loan data like this, we want to know if the denial or acceptance rates differ by
another factor, such as race.
Here are the descriptive statistics for the Race and Action variables:

That’s messy. Each variable has too many options. And the results for race are greatly
skewed by the “no co-applicant” option. So we need first to re-compute these into new
variables before we can do meaningful analysis.
We will collapse Action into two groups: accept or reject. Because the numbers for race are
so small, we also will collapse race into two groups: minority and white.

Basic Stats in PSPP, NICAR 16 Denver, Norm Lewis / Page 20

Collapsing data

1. On the Tranform
menu, choose
Recode into Different
Variables.

2. Click
on Race.

3. Click on the
forward button
to move into
Variables box.
4. In the Variables
box, click on Race
to activate it.

5. In Output Variable
section, in the Name
box, type RaceDuo.

6. Click on the
Change button.

7. Click on the Old
and New Values …
button.

Basic Stats in PSPP, NICAR 16 Denver, Norm Lewis / Page 21

These are the answer categories from the code book for race:
1. American Indian or Alaska Native
2. Asian
3. Black or African American
4. Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander
5. White
6. Information not provided by applicant in mail, Internet, or telephone application
7. Not applicable
8. No co-applicant
For RaceDuo, we will combine 1, 2, 3 and 4 into one Minority category (new value: 1) and
renumber White from a 5 to 2. Ignore data from 6, 7 and 8.

8. Under the
Old Value
section, in the
Value box,
type 5.

9. Under the
New Value
section, in the
Value box,
type 2.

10. Click Add.

11. Click on the Range
button to activate that
section.

12. In the first
Range box, type 1.
13. In the second
Range box, type 4.

14. In the New
Value box, replace
the existing
number with 1.

15. Click Add.

Basic Stats in PSPP, NICAR 16 Denver, Norm Lewis / Page 22

16. Click
Continue.

17. Click OK.

18. In the Data Editor
window, for our new variable
RaceDuo, click on the Value
Labels … button. Using the
techniques learned earlier,
assign a label of Minority to 1
and White to 2.

Basic Stats in PSPP, NICAR 16 Denver, Norm Lewis / Page 23

Repeat the process to create the AcceptYN variable.

19. On the Tranform
menu, again choose
Recode into Different
Variables.

20. Select the Action
variable, move it into the
Variables window and
create the new Output
Variable, ActionYN; click
on Change and then on
Old and New Values …

The code book offered these values for the Action variable. The ones in bold (1, 2 and 6)
indicate loan acceptance. No. 3 indicates the loan application was denied.
1. Loan originated
2. Application approved but not accepted
3. Application denied by financial institution
4. Application withdrawn by applicant
5. File closed for incompleteness
6. Loan purchased by the institution
7. Preapproval request denied by financial institution
8. Preapproval request approved but not accepted (optional reporting)
Thus, we will code 1, 2 and 6 as Accepted (new value: 1) and 3 as Denied (new value: 0)
and ignore the rest.

26. Click
Add.

27. Click Continue.

28. Click OK.

28. In the Data Editor
window, for our new
variable ActionYN,
click on the Value
Labels … button and
assign a label of
Denied to 0 and
Accepted to 1.

PART 9: DATA ANALYSIS
Now, let’s see if there is a statistically significant relationship between action taken on
loans and race. Keep in mind as we do that the numbers for each are small.
Because each of these is a categorical variable, few statistical tests are available. One that
will work is a chi-square test available through a crosstab.
1. Under the
Analyze
menu, choose
Descriptive
Statistics and
then
Crosstabs …

2. Scroll through
the variables to
get the two new
ones at the
bottom.

3. Select RaceDuo and
move it into Rows.
4. Select ActionYN and
move it into Columns.

The Format,
Statistics and Cells
buttons offer many
options, but the
defaults will work
fine for this test.

5. Click
OK.

Basic Stats in PSPP, NICAR 16 Denver, Norm Lewis / Page 27

Results appear in the Output Viewer.
Let’s break these sections apart.
First, the Summary section reveals that
just 30 percent of the 81,336 cases in
the data set match both criteria in the
variables ActionYN and RaceDuo:
 Applicant declares to be either
white or a minority.
 Loan was either accepted or
denied.
That 30% figure warns that we must be
careful in evaluating the results. Our
analysis is for just a subset.

Next, skip to the bottom and the outcome of the chi-square test. Because this is a 2 X 2 test,
we use the Continuity Correction line.

The value
reported, 33.57, is
the size of the chisquare statistic.
This is a relatively
large value.

The .000 refer to
probability. This is
misleading, for a
probability of 0 is
impossible. PSPP is
trying to tell us is that
the probability is less
than .001, or in the
language of statistics:
p < .001

For data involving people, a pvalue of less than 5 percent (p <
.05) is statistically significant. The
p < .001 means that if there were
no relationship between race and
loan acceptance, the chance of
getting these data would be less
than 1 in 1,000. So something is
going on here. We need to look at
the middle table to figure out
what that something is.

Basic Stats in PSPP, NICAR 16 Denver, Norm Lewis / Page 28

The chi-square statistic measures the difference between expected and observed values.
Expected value
In this data, 6.59 percent of all mortgage applications were denied. Thus, the expected value
is that the 6.59 percent figure would be roughly similar for minorities and for whites.
Observed value
But the observed value is different. It shows that 9.92 percent of minority loans were
denied while 6.33 percent of white loans were denied.

Observed

Expected
value

Interpretation
PSPP has found a statistically significant relationship between race and denial of mortgage.
Thus, we appear to have a news story here.
However, don’t jump to the keyboard just yet. More analysis and evaluation are needed
before you’re ready to broadcast or publish.
Remember, this relationship involves only 30 percent of the mortgage applications. More
choices are available than just accept or deny. Some withdraw an application or fail to
complete it. And these mortgage applications are only for purchase of owner-occupied
homes. They exclude other types of loans such as remodels or multi-family units.
Further, the denial portion is so small – 6.6 percent – that only a couple dozen cases in a
year would change these results. Small numbers can yield unrepresentative results.
And we would want to look further at the loan-to-income ratio we computed to see if it is
associated with race. It may be that the real difference is the debt ratio, not race.
But this exercise does show how journalists can find a story in data using a free statistical
package. Happy sleuthing!
