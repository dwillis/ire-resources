Sources of data and information on oil and gas
drilling:
FracFocus.org
Industry uses this site to disclose the chemicals it uses in hydraulic
fracturing. It can be even more useful for volumes of water used, and
precise, lat-long locations of wells. This is not an industry-run site, but it is
industry supported and industry funded.
Fracking data
FracFocus doesn't make its information easily accessible, though things
are changing. This is a hobbyist computer expert who tries to make the
information more accessible.

Air Pollution from Oil and Gas Development
Air pollutants are emitted during every phase of oil and gas development
(drilling, fracking, production, processing, distribution, etc), from a variety
of sources (wells, generator, waste pits, trucks, compressor stations,
pipelines, etc).
There are dozens of pollutants with different health and environmental
effects.
—1. Pollutants with global impacts: methane, CO . No matter where they're
released from, they contribute to a global problem (climate change).
2

—2. Pollutants with regional impacts: ozone, created by chemical reactions
between nitrogen oxides and VOCs (volatile organic compounds).
—
3. Pollutants with local impacts: VOCs like benzene, toluene, xylene and
formaldehyde); hydrogen sulfide; PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons)
If you’re researching air pollution in a particular community, it’s unlikely that
you’ll find good air monitoring data for the area or health studies conducted
on that community. You’ll probably have to rely on other types of evidence
to track how the industry’s air pollution is regulated and enforced, such as
citizen complaints; regulators’ inspection/investigation reports; regulatory
penalties and enforcement records; air permits for individual facilities;
health studies of other communities near O&G sites.
Industry data
Baker Hughes has published data for years on the number of rigs
operating in the U.S. and elsewhere. Some say the count is becoming less
relevant as rigs become more efficient, but it remains the standard for
measuring oil and gas activity.

Tips for reporting on induced earthquakes:
1. Read the major studies on induced seismicity. There is a scientific
consensus on this issue and the peer-reviewed studies date back
decades. The U.S. Geological Survey is the best place to start.
http://earthquake.usgs.gov/ After you’ve done enough research and
interviewed several seismologists, don’t be afraid to write with
authority.
2. If your state is one with increased earthquakes that appear to be
induced by oil and gas activities, consider getting an app such as
Quakewatch on your phone.

3. Visit ground zero. Where are the epicenters of the quakes in your
state? Visit there and get to know those people. Ask about damage
to their homes.
4. Where are the seismometers? Get a map of the existing seismic
stations in your state and understand how they work. Here’s one for
Oklahoma … http://www.okgeosurvey1.gov/pages/seismicstations.php
5. Is your state geological survey underreporting magnitudes? There
are two basic ways to calculate earthquake magnitude. The local
magnitude, also known as the Richter scale, is accurate for smaller
quakes, while moment magnitude is generally used for larger quakes but
is more difficult to compute, according to the USGS. Which measurement
is your state using to track larger quakes and how do those magnitude
scores compare with what is reported nationally? http://bit.ly/17ImnC1

Track industry influence:
a.
Is your state geological survey housed in a university? If the school
of geology is named after an oilman, it’s possible the science is being
skewed. Ask for emails to and from key officials with words like “induced
seismicity,” “injection well” and “earthquake.” Here’s an example of what
you may find:

b.
Get campaign contribution data for key players deciding energy
policy. We found nearly all members of our state’s earthquake committee
were somehow connected to the energy industry.

7.
Look at other states: Is your state geological survey unable to make
a connection between injection wells and earthquakes? Examine studies
and actions of other states such as Arkansas and Kansas that are dealing
with the problem. Compare that to how your state is handling the issue.

8.
Insurance: Ask your state insurance commission for any rulings,
regulations or guidance to insurers offering earthquake insurance. We
found that insurers were quietly excluding quakes triggered by fracking and
wastewater injection wells. Ask for # of claims filed, # of claims paid and
total dollar amount of claims paid in your state.
9.
What’s the risk: Talk to structural engineers about whether structures
like bridges, dormitories and other large buildings are at risk from frequent
low-level earthquakes. Depending on the building codes in your state, they
may be. Insurance rates are set based on risk maps produced by the U.S.
Geological Survey and other institutions. Will rates rise in your state due to
induced seismicity?
10. The legal landscape: Look for lawsuits in your state against energy
companies with injection wells that are possibly linked to earthquakes in
specific areas. These lawsuits have been successful in other states so
they are becoming more common.
