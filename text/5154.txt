http://trac.syr.edu/phptools/reports/reports.php?layer=immigration&report_type=tool

•

Track Federal Criminal Immigration Prosecutions By District* (there is a small fee for a
report but you can see some numbers for free)
http://tracfed.syr.edu/index/index.php?layer=cri

Example: Prosecutions of illegal reentry in Colorado federal court
First choose prosecutions, fiscal year or latest month
District: Colorado
Program: Immigration
Lead charge: Reentry
