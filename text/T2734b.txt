Introduction
• Florida’s Vanishing Wetlands
• www.sptimes.com/wetlands
• Breaking new ground:
• Satellite imagery analysis, e-mail
database mining, wikis, social
network analysis.
• And oh yeah, lots of shoe leather.

Introduction
• Find your unified field theory.
• Get it yourself
• Ask about numbers
• Listen for databases
• Don’t forget the humans
• Don’t be afraid of ambition

Unified Field Theory
• Look at what connects events.
• What’s the story no one is writing?
• They all needed wetland permits
• National Research Council report:
Mitigation is a myth
• Corps issues more wetland permits in
Florida in than any other state

Get it yourself
• Sometimes, the only way to answer
a question is to get the answer
yourself.
• How many acres of wetlands were
lost during No Net Loss?
• Corps permit database was so
flawed as to be useless.
• Thousands of permits, three fields.

Get it yourself
• One way: satellite imagery analysis
• What did we need?
• About $8,000 in software and
hardware.
• Two college courses (with lovely
things like physics and algebra).
• Shudder.

Get it yourself
• What else did we need? Time.
• Choose a simple methodology.
• Vet it with experts.
• Assess your accuracy when you are
done.
• Report it all, in print and online.

Ask about numbers
• What are they counting?
• What aren’t they counting?
• Who’s compiling the numbers?
• “It’s all in Nancy’s desk.”
• Used paper reports for spreadsheet
• Result: Found only a 6 percent
reduction, smaller than national
average of 20 percent

Listen for databases
• You will never know what is
available to you unless you ask.
• When you interview people, ask
them what databases they keep.
• Request the agencies records
retention schedule -- it has
everything.
• Why do this? You’d be amazed.

Listen for databases
• Congress and the Corps.
• The corps in Florida gets so many
letters from congressmen they track
them with a database.
• Dates, project names, permit
numbers
• FOIA’s galore

Don’t forget the humans
• Need some human voices
• Resources: PEER
• Always ask sources for more sources
• Tracked down former colonels
• Civic activists helped
• Human impact of decisions

Don’t be afraid of ambition
• There are lots of reasons not to do
something like the wetlands project.
• Money, time, deadlines, editors.
• Ask yourself these two questions:
• If not you, who?
• If it was easy, wouldn’t everyone do
it?

Don’t be afraid of ambition
• Don’t tell your editors.
• Build slow, gather string.
• FOIA in your free time -- they can
take months, if not years, from the
federal government.
• Got a tuition reimbursement plan?
Use it. Beg your way into classes.

Don’t be afraid of ambition
• When trying to break new ground,
plan for failure.
• If the satellite imagery analysis fails…
• Always be aiming toward a story.
• With dozens of interviews, thousands
of documents and gigabytes of
data, keep it simple.
