Failures in the justice system: Unequal
treatments and unpunished felons
Saturday, March 13, 2004

Beat reporters covering state, federal or municipal courts often spot or feel trends on the fly.
They may sense, for instance, that white-collar criminals face penalties less severe than those
convicted of drug possession and other crimes. They may believe courts or judges administer
justice unequally, sentencing one group of offenders more harshly than others. But how can a
reporter substantiate those feelings or quantify those differences? Here is one way to start:
TRACFED (http://tracfed.syr.edu/) part of the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse
University, maintains federal prosecution, sentencing and other data online and offers a subscription query
service. TRACFED allows reporters to construct queries that will provide data on various agencies, such as the
IRS, DEA or FBI, or to look at various crimes or groups of crimes overall or in different federal districts.
Benefits:
Lets you rank or examine federal districts (such as the Northern District of Alabama or the Southern District of
Ohio) by lead charge or crime categories such as official corruption, drug possession or white collar crime.

You can look closer by focusing on the lead charge, rather than the more general “program” category. An

Problems and cautions:
TRAC requires a subscription and can be costly (an annual license, which includes support,
runs about $1,000) and complicated. It requires some time to master. TRAC case details do
not provide case numbers or defendant’s names or demographics. Also, be aware that most of
the sentencing disparities in federal courts are due to strict sentencing guidelines.
Solutions:
1.

Check to see if your federal district’s data processing people are more competent than
ours. Perhaps they can determine a way to search for data without a case number or
name.

2.

A kludgy but effective alternative: Use Pacer (http://pacer.psc.uscourts.gov/), the federal
government’s internet-based court search system, to reverse lookup the cases. Identify a
single date in the date range, enter USA for the party, and search in the proper district.
Check by judge’s initials and other fields, and you are ready to contact the subjects of
your story.

Finally:
As always, use your data to point you toward your story. The story is not usually about the
numbers, but about the people those numbers represent. In Birmingham, for instance, we
found Sheila Pickett Allen, who stole $138,000 from the bank where she worked. Most of the
money came from a church account. The records from TRAC and Pacer pointed us to Allen,
and to the federal judge who disregarded sentencing guidelines by sentencing her to one hour
in custody. She did not have to pay a fine. She did not have to pay restitution. There were
many like her.
