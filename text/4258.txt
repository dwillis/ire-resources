 A tip that a government worker has a possibly

shady side business. How do you investigate?
 Tip 1: Start with Nexis scrub

 Sounds kind of like “Los Angeles Coliseum

Events”
 Off to the Secretary of State’s office!
 Secretary of state has incorporation records.

 We go find out.
 We think of all the things we can ask him.

 Assessor records
 We got the address of his house

 Around the time of his incorporation of his

company

 1. Nexis scrub of person (has addresses,

property records, records showing what
company he or she owns)
 2. Secretary of state records for business
registration form
 3. Assessor’s records / Zillow to learn more
about properties
 4. In California, “conflict of interest form 700”
forms for public officials

 How financially healthy is the Coliseum?
 Coliseum’s manager keeps saying the

Coliseum is profitable!

 Money in – money out = Money left over
 Or in other words
 Operating revenue – operating expenses =

what you’re left with

 The Coliseum has actually been losing money

for quite some time.

Other key records:
- Salaries (to put story in
context)
-DMV records
-(General manager had
given himself his old
retired 2005 Cadillac
towncar to himself,
after Coliseum gave him
a new 2009 version)

 5. Annual reports
 6. Expense reports
 7. Gasoline receipts
 Are they actually local, or are they in Las Vegas,

Orlando?

8. Large equipment purchases

 Coroner reports: show cause of death
 Key coroner’s reports:

- Michael Jackson
- Kanye West’s mom, who died after weight loss
surgery
 Query: all the people who have died of

possible drug overdoses shortly after raves by
two Los Angeles companies?

 Jared Lee Loughner is named the suspected

shooter of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords
 We know where he went to school.

 “Pima Community College Department of

Public Safety reports mentioning Jared Lee
Loughner .”
 And there was tons of stuff in there, leading
up to his suspension from the school,
including a Youtube video where he says,
“This is genocide in America.”

 College didn’t initially release the video, but

my coworker demanded it

 I know, I know, it sounds so boring, you want

to cry. But…
 IRS tax records for non profits.

at NPR
 Look at NPR’s balance sheets.

 AAJA
 Your local public radio station
 Any other nonprofit, such as…

 LM2 is kind of like the Form 990, but for

unions.
 You might find some irregularities there – like
large payments to a weird company that
happens to be owned by the union head’s
wife



 13. Form 2567
 These are inspection reports for hospitals, nursing

homes collected by the U.S. Centers for Medicare
