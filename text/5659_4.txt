Fund for Investigative
Journalism
Who we are…
For nearly a half century, the Fund for Investigative Journalism has supported
freelance and independent journalists with reporting grants of up to $10,000 per
project.
Our criteria…
Submit your investigative idea in the form of a proposal, including details of how
you plan to report and write it. Proposals typically are 1-2 pages. Also include a
proposed budget (a sample budget can be found at http://bit.ly/sample_budget).
Calls for applications are issued three to four times a year.
Our grantees…
FIJ journalists—emerging and veteran reporters—produce watchdog journalism
that matters. Grant recipient Christina Goldbaum won this year’s Livingston
Award for international reporting for her coverage of the massacre of Somali
civilians after a botched U.S. military raid. Journalist Seymour Hersh won a
Pulitzer Prize for his FIJ-supported investigation of the My Lai massacre during the
Vietnam War.
Where to apply…
You can apply for a grant at www.FIJ.org
FIJ strongly encourages journalists of color, women and ethnic media to apply.
