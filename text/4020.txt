‘Lopez, the entry-level patrolman in Porterville, owns

seven houses worth a combined $1.2 million, scattered
across Porterville and the Los Angeles area. Lopez lives in
one of his Porterville homes – a nondescript tan structure
with a well-manicured front yard. The patrolman said he
uses the house primarily to sleep and store his
belongings.
In the garage of his main residence, he keeps two pristine
1956 Chevrolet Bel Airs, collectors’ items that gleam with
the original factory paint colors of “Tropical Turquoise”
and “Sierra Gold.” Each car is worth at least $50,000, or
about the same as Lopez’s base salary. ‘
