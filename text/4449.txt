TEN TECHNIQUES FOR GETTING PEOPLE TO TALK

1) NEVER ASSUME PEOPLE WON’T TALK. MANY PEOPLE WILL TALK
EVEN IF IT SEEMS ILLOGICAL. IF YOU ASSUME THEY WON’T, YOUR
BODY LANGUAGE/TONE WILL CONVEY THAT.
2) GET AN INTRODUCTION.
3) MAKE THEM FEEL THEY ARE IN CONTROL. BE FRIENDLY. DON’T
COME ON TOO STRONG.
4) KEEP IT GOING. IF YOU APPROACH SOMEONE WHO WON’T TALK,
KEEP THE CONVERSATION GOING. MANY TIMES THEY WILL
ULTIMATELY TALK.
5) ELIMINATE THE FEAR FACTOR. TALKING TO YOU IS NO BIG DEAL.
MANY PEOPLE HAVE DONE IT ON THIS STORY.

6) APPEAL TO EGO. THEY ARE EXPERTS AND THEIR EXPERTISE IS
NEEDED FOR YOUR STORY. YOU WANT TO ASK ABOUT TECHNICAL
QUESTIONS.

7) TALK TO ALL THEIR FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES. TALK TO
EVERYONE ELSE IN THE FIELD. WHEN THE WORD GETS BACK, THEY
WILL PROBABLY FEAR NOT TALKING.
8) IT WILL LOOK DUMB TO SAY YOU REFUSED TO COMMENT.
9) YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IN THE STORY IS CORRECT.
10)
BE PERSISTENT. SOMETIMES PEOPLE REGRET TURNING YOU
DOWN, AND CHANGE THEIR MINDS IF YOU GO BACK A SECOND
TIME, OR EVEN A THIRD.
