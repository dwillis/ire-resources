From Silos to Mashups

CAR 2011

Definition: Mashup is a web page or application that uses and
combines data, presentation or functionality from two or more
sources to create new services
• Why do we want this?
•

•
•
•

•

Enable out services in many applications and on a variety of
devices (laptop
(laptop, high
high-res
res display wall
wall, ipad,
ipad iphone or the others)
Share and reuse is a good thing
Reach communities with our tools and their data!!!

What can we do to change this?
•
•
•

We can think and create data driven solutions so that they can be
mashed up
p with other tools.
We can build web services that can be deployed or accessed.
We can create API’s to be used.

Major Capabilities
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

•

Dataflow execution
Semantic technology (using RDF for storing meta info)
Web-Oriented
Supports publishing services for data, analytics and
visualization
Modular components
Encapsulation and execution mechanism
Promotes reuse, sharing, and collaboration
Cloud-friendly infrastructure
Implements MapReduce for parallelization

Note: Trading off some performance for reuse, flexibility and modular
components… with option to parallelize components to improve
performance
