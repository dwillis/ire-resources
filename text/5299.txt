Final Thoughts
u

Look for an excuse to ask questions
u A system you want to test
u A history you want to see
u A family to find affected by a problem
u A breaking story you want to provide depth/context to
u A public official unwilling to tell the public what they’re doing

u

Ask for records first (you catch more bees with honey)

u

But ask for public records as often as possible. You never know where
they will lead you.
