Safety tips to cover the border
-- Safe travel
If you are going to enter a Mexican border City to do reporting, it is better to do it during
day hours. Preferably stay the night on the U.S. side.
Take always federal highways. If you use a local rural highway, do it during the day and
let your newsroom know in advance.
-- Look for reliable fixers.
The best fixers are usually local reporters who know the area well and are skilled to
navigate in uncertain and risky environments. You can ask the Border Center and we
can provide names and contact information.
-- Contact with authorities.
Mexican local border authorities are not very reliable. If you contact them, do not
provide your schedule information.
-- Taking photos or video

If you are going to take photos or video do it with professional cameras, not with mobile
phones. Always carry a media ID and always look as a professional journalist not as a
spy or a tourist. Exceptions apply.
-- Sensitive information
Preferably, do not take sensitive information with you in the computer or the mobile
phones. Leave all information encrypted on the cloud. Memorize some useful data.
-- Going further on the border
If you go beyond 100 kilometers into Mexican territory, get permission from the Mexican
authorities and contact the local U.S. Consulate.
-- Interviewing the bad guys
If you really need to interview one of the bad guys, you need to set up a security
protocol well in advance. Your fixer needs to be extremely reliable and you need to do a
risk assessment before attempting anything.
