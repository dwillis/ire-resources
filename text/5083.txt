Working with academics
Matt Dempsey, Houston Chronicle
1) Academics are great for doing original research that makes a value judgement
An editor asked me why we needed to work with Texas A&M on creating a potential-for-harm
index for chemical plants. My reply was I’m not a chemist. There’s a lot of chemical data out
there but I didn’t feel like I had enough expertise to say a flammable hazard was more or less
dangerous than a toxic hazard. The chem safety experts at A&M were though.
2) Be patient. Academics don’t work on the same time scale as reporters
Once we got A&M the data, we wanted to know how long it would take for them to finish their
side of the project. Their estimate was 2-3 months. It ended up being 4-5 months. The
researchers were very resistant to the idea of deadline pressure. Know that going in and you’ll
save yourself some heartburn.
3) When student workers are involved, expect turnover
4) Communicate clearly and frequently.
We started the project with one post-doc leading the group of researchers. Then she left for a
corporate job. Then we had a second post-doc take over. She left for a job. We finished with the
professor in charge of the center getting everyone to the finish line. All this turnover meant we
had to communicate very clearly what the expectations were and whether we were meeting
them or not.
5) It’s a collaboration. Collaborate!
A&M finished its academic report and it was great. Except one thing. We wanted to add in a
penalty for having process safety violations from OSHA inspections. A&M was happy to consult
us on what it thought the appropriate penalty would be but didn’t feel comfortable including it in
the academic paper. We thought that was a good compromise. We explained it all in our
methodology.
6) Publish your methodology!
It’s important for academics. It’s important for us as journalists too if we’re working WITH
academics. Heck, we should be publishing our methodology when we do any kind of complex
analysis anyway.
