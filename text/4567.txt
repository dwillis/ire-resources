Q: Why is North Dakota Crude Oil Exploding?
We found a data source for vapor
pressure at the Capline Pipeline
website.
Then we scraped all the data and
put it in an Excel file.

A: It’s the combustible gases
Feb 23 WSJ :
“Crude oil from North Dakota's Bakken Shale formation
contains several times the combustible gases as oil from
elsewhere, a Wall Street Journal analysis found, raising
new questions about the safety of shipping such crude by
rail across the U.S.

“Federal investigators are trying to determine whether
such vapors are responsible for recent extraordinary
explosions of oil-filled railcars, including one that killed
several dozen people in Canada last summer.”

The Rise of a New, More Volatile “Ultralight”
Crude
Not all crudes are the same.

Light and “ultralight” crudes have more gases (ethanes, butanes, etc.)
entrained in them. This raises their RVP and makes them more
volatile.
“The federal government says 96% of the growth in production since
2011 is of light and ultralight oil and that is where growth will
continue.” – WSJ 6/24/14 (Sider & Friedman)

The math of crude by rail:
1.125 million barrels a day (Dec. ‘14)
700 barrels/car = 1,607 car loads
Each train is ~ 100 cars – 105 cars
So 15-16 trains departing daily
Or, about one every 90 minutes

Even at today’s lower level of 990,000 barrels/day – still
13-14 crude trains/day

To Stabilize or
Not to Stabilize
“When energy companies started extracting oil from shale
formations in South Texas a few years ago, they invested
hundreds of millions of dollars to make the volatile crude safer
to handle.

“In North Dakota's Bakken Shale oil field, nobody installed the
necessary equipment. The result is that the second-fastest
growing source of crude in the U.S. is producing oil that
pipelines often would reject as too dangerous to transport.”

“This isn’t a structural fire that we
can knock down in an hour or two,”
he said. “This is something we’d be
dealing with for days.” -- Jordan
Zaretsky, a fire battalion chief in
nearby Teaneck, N.J.
