Places to start…

The U.S. Census Bureau website:
www.census.gov
The gateway to all of their data. Bookmark this site if you don’t have it already. If you
really want to be ahead of the curve, call the U.S. Census Bureau Public Information
Office at (301) 763-3030 and get on their media embargo list. The bureau releases the
best data ahead of time to reporters and editors under embargo. That gives you more time
to come up with a better story.

Census bureau’s population estimates division:
http://eire.census.gov/popest/estimates.php
Released yearly, the population estimates division tries to estimate the populations of
states, counties and cities over 10,000 people. Data is available in Excel spreadsheets.

Economic Census:
http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/econ97.html
Quiet right now, the Economic Census will become news in 2004, when the first data
from this every-five-years survey of local businesses is released.

American Factfinder
http://factfinder.census.gov/
It takes some practice, but the American Factfinder is a great way to access Census data
from the 2000 and 1990 Censuses. Most of the data that was released in torrents is there,
especia lly for the 2000 version, which was the first to be primarily distributed over the
internet. There are tools there to build custom queries for small areas of geography, and a
mapping tool that lets you see your data. Worth taking the time to learn.
