Quick hits/Longer projects talk
Jenifer McKim, New England Center for Investigative Reporting
April 29, 2014
We all don’t have luxury or time for long-term investigations.
But there are stories you can do every day, every week, that use investigative tools.
Things to think about when you start:
What breaking news story tells you of bigger problems?
A bridge collapses – what’s the safety of the other bridges?
A child dies – what are gaps in the system?
How do we compare statewide or nationally.
When breaking news happens:
Quickly think of what public records are out there that can tell a bigger story.
Start to pull them. Talk to experts about what is out there.
Go beyond competition:
Don’t attribute, verify
Conduct back ground checks
For nonprofits, look at 990s
For businesses, look at licenses, public records, sec filings
As part of your beat:
Regularly check for lawsuits against government agencies you cover
Regularly check for actions, lawsuits for businesses covered
Check salaries annually
Who is the highest paid? Who got biggest raise
Look at open checkbook
Tracking spending:
Travel budgets
Annual budgets
Audits
Credit card statements
Read the boring stuff. You’ll never know what you will find. Read before bed, read at
home. Read at lunch. Read the best stuff. Read the prize winners. Read non fiction.
Even if you can’t go to IRE conference – you can read the best stories of the year.
Campaign financing
Who’s giving who money
Who is getting the most money

Foreclosures: Who is buying them?
In Mass, a private company tracks local housing. Can ask for list of people buying
foreclosures track them. See who’s the biggest purchaser. Scrub them.
