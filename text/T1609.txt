Privacy? What’s that?
The right “to be let alone”
---Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis
Harvard Law Review
1890

Some privacy facts:
z An explicit “right to privacy” isn’t in the Bill of Rights
y 4th Amendment protects against unreasonable government
searches - but not against invasions by business or individuals
y 5th Amendment prohibits forced testimony against yourself

z The term privacy itself isn’t even mentioned in the
y entire U.S. Constitution

z Any Constitutional protection that does
y exist only applies to invasions by
y government

More on privacy
z So, the only protections provided against invasions by
businesses (including the press) are from specific laws
that get passed.
z While there are lots of federal and state privacy laws on
the books, bills often die in legislatures because vested
business interests outgun privacy groups.
z Despite industry resistance, a privacy bill can sail through
after somebody “important” has been offended:
y Example: U.S. Video Privacy Protection Act (1988) a.k.a. “The Bork
Bill,” protects video rental records. Passed after Supreme Court
nominee Robert Bork’s video rental records were exposed.
Meanwhile Internet privacy bills have languished in Congress for
years.

Who invades privacy?
z The government (Federal, state, local)
z Companies you do business with
y Online, catalogs, retail stores, airlines, NFL
(Super bowl)

z Companies you don’t do business with
z Employers
z Spouses
z Anyone else who wants to
y know about you

Types of privacy invasions
Medical (hospitals, doctors, insurance, drug companies)
Financial (banks, credit cards)
Political (law enforcement, profiling)
Online (Web sites, spammers, software companies)
Children’s privacy (Web sites, entertainment media,
game makers, candy companies)
z Other: Appliance makers (e.g. Studios and broadcasters
recently tried to force SonicBlue to collect viewing habits
of its ReplayTV users)

Possible consequences of
privacy invasion
z Get fired or turned down for job
z Lose credit, mortgage
z Denied insurance
z Arrest
z Redlining and discrimination
z Social stigma / embarrassment
z Feel personally violated

Difficulties reporting
on privacy
z Invasions often aren’t obvious - even
victims may not know
z Victims can be hard to find, reluctant to
go on the record
z Some invasions seem victimless (e.g. Web
cookies)
z Records can be hard to locate/obtain databases held by corporations & gov’t

What you need for a report on
business invasions
1. Tips
2. Victims
3. Victim-substitute (i.e. smoking gun)
4. Privacy advocates
5. Government officials
6. Trade and self-regulatory assns.

The key Federal agency for privacy issues
Who to work with: Bureau of Consumer Protection
Current focus is on enforcing of existing privacy protections
Recent privacy actions:
x January 2002: Eli Lilly settled FTC charges it violated privacy of
visitors to prozac.com
x February 2002: American Pop corn Company paid $10,000 fine for
collecting info from kids on the Web

y FTC’s privacy Wed page:
x (www.ftc.gov/privacy/index.html) - News releases,

• laws, FTC reports

Trade Associations and
other creatures of industry
z Marketers:
y Direct Marketing Association (www.the-dma.org) - the folks who send
you junk snail mail
y Network Advertising Initiative (www.networkadvertising.org) - the folks
who plant Web browser “cookies” on your hard drive

z Self-regulation:

Keep in mind: These are not consumer protection agencies, but industry
inventions designed to bolster consumer confidence.
y TrustE - Privacy seals on Web sites (www.trustE.org)
x Its sponsors include major corporations like AOL & Microsoft
y Better business bureau - Privacy seals (www.bbbonline.org)

Online privacy
investigations: Tools I use
z Screen image Grabber: SnagIt
z E-mail investigations - “Catch all”
z Wiretap your own browser - Junkbuster

Screen image grabber
z SnagIt 6.1 (MS Windows only) $39.95
z Why do you need it?
y To document Web findings for sourcing
y To produce hi-res images suitable for
publication

z What it does
y Will capture entire screen, just one window,
scroll thru a long window with/without cursor.

SnagIt (continued)
z Can output to printer, file, clipboard
z Can set high-resolution (in dpi) for
publishing - JPG, GIF, TIF formats
z Can capture when running dedicated
programs like such as AOL, MSN, AIM

Using SnagIt

Using SnagIt to
Document date/time
z In Windows, put cursor over “time” in lower
right hand corner. Date will appear for
about 5 seconds. Quickly CTRL-Shift-P to
capture entire screen, including date/time.

E-mail investigations
z Problem: How to track the way your email address gets used by Web sites
z Reason to do it: If a company uses your
info in a way that violates its own privacy
policy, it has violated the law
z Another reason: Track/document the
unexpected uses to which sites put your
address

E-mail tracking:
Overview
z Most flexible method: Set up a “catch
all” e-mail account. This will forward to
you all e-mail sent to that domain:
y e.g: A@xyz.com, B@xyz.com, etc.

z For each e-commerce site you register at,
use a unique e-mail address that you
never use anywhere else.
y E.g: A@xyz.com at Amazon
y E@xyz.com at EBay, etc.

E-mail tracking
(continued)
z Also consider registering other addresses
with online newsletters, health sites,
finance sites
z Set up e-mail filters in your e-mail client
to sort the incoming mail by address.
z Allow to simmer for a few weeks, maybe
months, while checking your e-mail.

What you need to do it
z You can register your own domain for
about $20. Example: xyz.com
z Set up a Web-hosting account that
includes “catch all” e-mail.
z Where I do it:
y http://tabnet.net/products/hosting/web/plans

z I use “Bronze plan” for $24.95/month
z Total cost for 3 mos: $20+$75 = $95

Setting up
your e-mail client
z Setting up a Eudora “filter” for mail from
address used at Amazon:

E-mail (continued)
z Setting up Eudora “filter” for mail from
address used at eBay:

Wiretapping your own
browser
z Why?
y To monitor what information your computer
actually sends to Web sites.

z How?
y Using something called a proxy-server, a
software wiretap that logs every byte sent to
and from the Web.
y Note: Setting up isn’t hard. But interpreting
data requires expertise in “HTTP” protocols.

Steps
z Download the “Junkbuster” from
www.junkbuster.com (MS Windows only)
z UnZip and run it in a DOS window
z Configure Junkbuster’s “ini” file so that
entire dialog will be written to a “log” file
z Configure your browser to use Junkbuster
z Surf Web

Configuring your browser
z Here’s an example using the Opera
browser. It’s essentially the same for
Internet Explorer and Netscape:

my PC and the Web

What real story have
I used this for?
z My June, 2000 report in Consumer
Reports: “Big Browser is Watching You:”
z

“Companies with an interest in knowing who's curious about them can use cookies to
find out. For example, when we entered the term "Chrysler" in the search engine at
web portal AltaVista, the site transmitted our information request to the
automaker's computer, not just to the usual ad network. Thus, if we wanted
to investigate whether a Chrysler product was subject to a class-action lawsuit, the
company would be tipped off to the time and date of visits by anyone searching for
related key words such as a vehicle model name, say, or a product recall.”

z The above finding was obtained and
documented via the Junkbuster.

Why this is a good time to
investigate privacy
z Zig while everyone else zags - security is
now getting more play than privacy
z Consumers may feel more tolerance for
government surveillance right now. But
commercial surveillance has nothing to do
with national security - it’s just for private
profit.

Online investigative ideas
z Checking “leakage” by commercial Web
sites (and e-newsletters) of personal info,
including e-mail address.
z How much “spyware” gets planted on
your PC when you download shareware?
z Which children’s sites are violating COPPA
y (the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act
of 1998)
