you take on your targets

I have done interviews embedded
with soldiers in Iraq……

… and with the Taliban in Afghanistan

Interviews with young girls
who were trafficked

See more: www.juliansher.com/books

… and with leaders of the Hells Angels

msnbc

I have also been
interviewed
many times…

What makes a good interviewer?

EVERY INTERVIEW IS
A CONSTANT FIGHT FOR CONTROL

The challenge of every interview:
Who is in control of the ball?

AND HOW DO YOU SCORE IN SPORTS?

In sports, you are lucky if you control the ball
50% of the game…
In interviews you need to be in control 100%
of the time

How do you prepare for
the tough interview?

We focus on research, facts…

but too often we ignore
strategy

THE GOAL TODAY IS TO GET YOU TO:
> THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX

> RADICALLY CHANGE THE WAY YOU LOOK
AT INTERVIEWS
> SHOW YOU HOW TO ALWAYS KEEP
CONTROL OF THE BATTLE

MASTERING THE INVESTIGATIVE INTERVIEW:
• 1. THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF INTERVIEWS
• 2. THE FIVE RULES OF GOOD INTERVIEWS
(AND HOW TO BREAK THEM)

• 3. WHAT TO DO TO WHEN YOU
GET INTO TROUBLE
• 4. STORY-TELLING WHEN YOU
ARE INTERVIEWING
• 5. STRATEGY AND TACTICS

A TEST: ASK ME
ABOUT
THIS COURSE

YOU NEED
TO THINK ABOUT NOT JUST
THE QUESTIONS,
BUT THE TYPE OF INTERVIEW
YOU ARE DOING…

1. The Three Types of Interviews

ACCOUNTABILITY

How guilty did you feel that you were drunk
at the wheel in the crash that killed her?

EMOTION
What did her loss mean to you?

INFORMATION
When did you first learn your daughter
was killed in the car accident?

Some interviews are mainly information
[for example, experts]

90% INFORMATION.

10% EMOTION

Some interviews are mainly emotion,
with some information
[usually your main character, the victim,
the protagonist]

70% EMOTION.

20% INFORMATION

10% ACCOUNTABILITY

Interviews with
the powerful are
almost all accountability
RUSSIA?

SNC?

80% ACCOUNTABILITY. 10% EMOTION
KHASHOGGI?

10% INFORMATION

The best interviews have all three,
in this order:

ACCOUNTABILITY

EMOTION
INFORMATION

Watch as Gayle King of CBS follows the three steps
with accused sexual molester R. Kelly:

•
•
•

INFORMATION: WHY ARE YOU SITTING DOWN WITH US TODAY?
EMOTION:
WHAT ARE THE LIES THAT DISTURB YOU THE MOST?
ACCOUNTABILITY:
-HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING THAT YOU REGRET, HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING
WRONG?
-ARE YOU SAYING EVERYBODY WAS NOT TELLING THE TRUTH?
-WHY WOULD ALL THESE WOMEN TELL THESE STORIES ABOUT YOU?

2.The Basic
Rules
for Good
Interviews

You get the answers you deserve
• Don’t blame the
interviewee
• Ask a stupid question,
you get a stupid answer
So how can we ask smarter questions?

1. ASK OPEN-ENDED
NOT CLOSED QUESTIONS:
• ALWAYS ASK THE 5 Ws:

WHO?
WHAT?
WHERE?
WHY?

WHEN?

• AVOID
YES/NO ANSWERS

The Bad Sports Interview

• QUESTION: IS THERE EVER A POINT AT WHICH
YOU DON’T THINK YOU CAN COME BACK?
AND WHAT’S YOUR MINDSET?
• PLAYER: NO.
• QUESTION: SO TELL ME ABOUT THAT –
• PLAYER: THANK YOU

2. DON'T GIVE PEOPLE
EASY ESCAPE ROUTES:

• ASK ONE QUESTION ONLY
• DON’T GIVE THEM EASY CHOICES
• WATCH FOR THE UNNEEDED ADJECTIVE
• OR PHRASE OR THE UNNEEDED FACT

Giving Putin a choice

WATCH FULL HELSINKI PRESS CONFERENCE: http://tinyurl.com/ybpose3o
WATCH HIGHLIGHTS: http://tinyurl.com/y7wzhcto

QUESTION: Did you want President Trump to
win the election?
And did you direct any of your officials to help
him do that?
ANSWER:

Giving Putin a choice

Giving Putin a choice – He answers the
easiest question: the first one:
Did you want President
Trump to win the election?
And did you direct any of
your officials to help him do
that?
Putin: Yes I did, yes I did.
Because he talked about
bringing the U.S.-Russia
relationship back to normal.

Why didn’t Obama arm the Syrian rebels?
We’ll never know with this question that gives him an
escape… by adding just seven unnecessary words at the end

Obama gets an easy escape:
• CHARLIE ROSE: You do not accept the idea
that if you do what the rebels want you do,
the Free Syrian Army wants you to do and
what Arab governments want you do that it
would turn the tide and lead to Assad leaving
… which has been, I think, your objective.
BARACK OBAMA: Well, my
objective, understand, is
Assad leaving because
he delegitimized himself.

When a question mark comes out of
your mouth…

• STOP TALKING!!!!

3. BASIC IS BEAUTIFUL - KEEP IT
CLEAN AND SIMPLE
AVOID LOADED OR
CONTROVERSIAL
WORDS…

Mr. Mayor – have you
not become the most
hated and corrupt
politician in town?
Isn’t that what all
climate change
deniers say?
Are you doing enough
to stop radical Islam
in your mosque?

OBAMA IS
QUESTIONNED ABOUT
HOSTAGES IN IRAN:
QUESTION: As you well know, there are four
Americans in Iran - three held on trumped up
charges according to your administration, one,
whereabouts unknown. Can you tell the country, sir,
why you are content, with all of the fanfare around
this [nuclear] deal to leave the conscience of this
nation, the strength of this nation, unaccounted for,
in relation to these four Americans?

OBAMA SEIZES ON ONE WORD:

4. THE WORST QUESTION IS NOT
ASKING ONE
• AVOID MAKING STATEMENTS, OPINIONS
• DO NOT GET INTO A DEBATE – YOU WILL
ALWAYS LOSE

WHY WILL YOU WILL ALWAYS LOSE?

BECAUSE IT’S AN UNFAIR FIGHT.
THEY CAN LIE, DEFLECT AND MAKE
STUFF UP. YOU CAN’T

• DEBATES MAY BE FUN TO WATCH -- BUT WE
DON’T LEARN ANYTHING

• STATEMENTS CAN KILL THE PACE OF AN
INTERVIEW
• STATEMENTS BY YOU WILL ALLOW THE TABLES
TO BE TURNED AGAINST YOU

ATTENTION…

responsibilities.
CBC: DID YOU GET THE BALANCE RIGHT? EIGHT MONTHS LATER, DID
YOU GET THE BALANCE RIGHT?
POLICE CHIEF: Well I think eight months later we are still determining
whether or not it was absolutely right. I think we did our best

CBC: IS THAT GOOD ENOUGH
POLICE CHIEF: Well that frankly will be for others to judge

1. HOW COULD THAT NOT HAVE OCCURRED TO YOU, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT?
YOU WERE GOING TO TAKE A FREE HOLIDAY FROM SOMEONE YOU CONSIDERED A
FRIEND.
HOW COULD THAT NOT HAVE OCCURRED TO YOU, THAT THAT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN
OKAY?

2. AT ONE POINT YOU DIDN’T SAY TO YOURSELF THAT MAYBE THIS IS NOT THE BEST
THING TO DO? YOU NEVER THOUGHT THAT?

#5: WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU GET INTO
TROUBLE
Because face it - you are going to lose
more than you will win…

WHAT TO DO :
WHEN THE INTERVIEW TURNS
INTO AN ARGUMENT

Be Firm – By Cutting it off, By taking an Aggressive Approach or by using Humour

The Aggressive Approach:
Lebanese TV: Rima Karaki vs. Sheikh Hani Al-Siba’i

WATCH VIDEO: http://tinyurl.com/yd56qf8o

The Humour Approach:
PIERS MORGAN PUSHES A REPUBLICAN POLITICIAN ON HER BOOK

WATCH EXCERPT: http://tinyurl.com/yafzqdrk

Defending your right to push:

• MORGAN: Because right now, I'm curious -- right now, I'm
curious about whether you support gay marriage.
O'DONNELL: You're borderline being a little bit rude. You
know, I obviously …
MORGAN: Why are you being so weird about this?
O'DONNELL: That's what I want to talk about.I'm not being
weird. You're being a little rude.
MORGAN: I'm baffled as to why you think I'm being rude.
I think I'm being rather charming and respectful. I'm just
asking questions based on your own public statements
and now what you've written in your own book. It's
hardly rude to ask you that surely.
O'DONNELL: Well, don't you think as a host, if I say this is
what I want to talk about, that's what we should address?
MORGAN: Not really, no. You're a politician.

WHAT TO DO :
… WHEN THE SUBJECT REFUSES
TO ANSWER THE DARN QUESTION!

Don’t get distracted – don’t lose focus:
Brian Seltzer (CNN) vs Jill Abramson (ex-NYT) on Plagiarism
Abramson will claim it’s “all in her footnotes,” that it was never “purposeful.”
But Seltzer will just use those excuses to push his main point…

Don’t get distracted – don’t lose focus:
Tapper vs. Trump on the “Mexican” judge

• TAPPER: What does this have to do with his heritage?
TRUMP: …this judge is of Mexican heritage. I'm building a
wall, OK? I'm building a wall. I am going to do very well with
the Hispanics, the Mexicans
TAPPER: So, no Mexican judge could ever be involved in a
case that involves you?
TRUMP: Well, he's a member of a society, where -- you know,
very pro-Mexico, and that's fine. It's all fine, but –
TAPPER: Except that you're calling into question his heritage.
TRUMP: I think he should recuse himself.
TAPPER: … if you're saying he can't do his job because of his
race, is that not the definition of racism?...
TRUMP: This judge is giving us unfair rulings. Now, I say why?
Well, I'm building a wall, OK? And it's a wall between Mexico.
Not another country.
TAPPER: But he's not from Mexico. He's from Indiana.
TRUMP: He's of Mexican heritage and he's very proud of it.
