About
Learn to apply a systematic approach to finding specific information using the Google and Lexis-Nexis.
The workshop will include an overview of key concepts and a walk-through of an audience volunteered search.
The overview will cover basics of word stemming, word truncation, word proximity, wildcards, controlled vocabularies
and free-text methodologies.
The walk-through will demonstrate Google’s “Fuzzy” search options, in addition to using Lexis-Nexis for newspaper
and document retrieval.

Basics
First, cover some common ground so we can speak the language of searching:

Operators
● Boolean Operations: AND, OR, NOT
○ Operators are used for including and excluding search terms:
■ This AND that
■ This OR that
■ This and NOT that
● Word Stemming:
○ Increases results by being more inclusive with search terms:
■ searching = search
■ searched = search
■ searcher = search
● Word Truncation aka “Wild Card”:
○ Increases results by being more inclusive with search phrases:
■ The color of the car is *
● “The color of the car is pink/red/blue/beige/orange/black”.
● “The color of the car is nice/ugly/chipped.”
■ The government spent $10* on the fiscal year budget.
● “The government spent $10 billion on the fiscal year budget.”
● “The government spent $10,000,000,000 on the fiscal year budget.”
● Word Proximity:
○ Find one term in relationship to another term:
■ “fiscal AROUND(4) year”
● “... fiscal budget for year ...”
● “... budget for fiscal year ...”
■ “chuck taylor AROUND(3) converse”
● “Chuck Taylor is a line of Converse...”
● “Converse and Chuck Taylor…”
● Controlled Vocabulary:
○ Limited number of terms that are specific for categorizing content. These exist in fact
based fields, such as a byline or dateline.
● Free Text:
○ An unlimited number of words that are within the content, such as an article lede,
headline, or paragraph.

Building Search Queries
Step 1) The search question: “I want the 2014 budget for the USDA Food Safety program”.
Using a template, let’s start with a conceptional framework for building the search query:
Concept Term 1

Concept Term 2

Concept Term 3

Combo Term 1

Concept Term 4

Combo Term 2

Combined Query

Step 2) Break the search question into concepts:
Concept Term 1

Concept Term 2

Concept Term 3

Concept Term 4

2014

Budget

USDA

Food Safety

Combo Term 1

Combo Term 2

Combined Query

Step 3) Identify matching thesaurus words for each concept and combo term:
Try searching on Google “synonym:budget”
Concept Term 1

Concept Term 2

Concept Term 3

Concept Term 4

Budget
● allocation
● income
● expenditure
● financial plan
● earmark

USDA
● Department of
Agriculture
● agriculture
● farming

Food
● nourishment
● sustenance
● nutriment

Safety
● well-being
● protection

Combo Term 1

Combo Term 2
Food Safety

* this category represents terms that can belong
in both Concept 1 and Concept 2

* this category represents terms that can belong
in both Concept 3 and Concept 4

Combined Query

In the example above, we have the original concept terms in addition to related terms.

Step 4) Now stem the search terms and combine the concepts into a single search query:
Concept Term 1

Concept Term 2

Concept Term 3

Concept Term 4

Budget
● allocat
● income
● expenditure
● financial-plan
● earmark

USDA
● Department of
Agriculture
● agricultur
● farm

Food
● nourish
● sustenance
● nutriment

Safe
● well-being
● protection

(food OR nourish OR
sustenance OR
nutriment)

(safe OR well-being
OR protection)

(budget OR allocat OR
income OR
expenditure OR
financial-plan OR
earmark)

(USDA OR
“Department of
Agriculture” OR
agricultur OR farm)

Combo Term 1

Combo Term 2
Food Safety

Combined Query
(budget OR allocat OR income OR expenditure OR financial-plan OR earmark) AND
(USDA OR “Department of Agriculture” OR agricultur OR farm) AND
(((food OR nourish OR sustenance OR nutriment) AND
(safe OR well-being OR protection))
OR food-safety)

Treat each concept as its own search query, and then combine the queries using the AND statement.
Note: To build the combined query, follow the “Order of Operations”:
P - Parenthesis
A - Addition
S - Subtraction

Pearl Growing and Weeding Out
When our search results are off-target, then we can either add (pearl growing) or remove (weeding out)
the search terms.
Pearl Growing is done by scanning relevant records for additional and related search terms to include
with search query.
Weeding Out is done by scanning our search results and removing the terms that frequently appear in
records that we do not want.

Concept Term 1

● well-being
● protection

(budget OR allocat OR
income OR

financial-plan OR
earmark)

New Query
(USDA OR
“Department of
Agriculture” OR
agricultur OR farm OR
site:.gov)

This AND NOT That
Step 4 will provide you with a solid search query, but if you want to see what the query is specifically
finding that regular keyword searching is not, then perform a “This AND NOT That” query.
Start with the original query:
Combined Query
(budget OR allocat OR income OR expenditure OR financial-plan OR earmark) AND
(USDA OR “Department of Agriculture” OR agricultur OR farm) AND
(((food OR nourish OR sustenance OR nutriment) AND
(safe OR well-being OR protection)) OR food-safety)

And use it to exclude regular search terms.
This AND NOT That Combined Query
(budget OR allocat OR income OR expenditure OR financial-plan OR earmark) AND
(USDA OR “Department of Agriculture” OR agricultur OR farm OR site:.gov) AND
(((food OR nourish OR sustenance OR nutriment) AND
(safe OR well-being OR protection)) OR food-safety) -budget* -USDA -food* -safe*

There are some redundancies with the search terms showing up in our This AND NOT That query. The
additional terms won’t hurt anything and it helps us keep the search query straight.
Notice we added the wild cards to the end of each term. Depending on the search engine, we are
forcing it to include all variations of the word, not just its original stem.
Compare the results side-by-side in browser windows to see the difference it makes.

Google Advanced Techniques
