Why is this background
relevant?
• History, organizational chart provide clues to
understanding agency:
• Vertical not horizontal
• Geographical isolation
• Common experience of independent fieldwork
• High numbers of MDs = overlay of residency culture

• Additional complication:
• CDC must be invited into jurisdictions (by state health
department or national ministry of health)
• Findings, results “belong” to jurisdiction

What are the implications for
reporters?
• To avoid being lost between silos, be clear
about your topic
• Keep jurisdictional issues in mind
• Be conscious of Atlanta-DC tensions
• Keep in mind that - post-9.11, post-SARS everyone else in the world wants to talk to
them too

Main point of entry
• Office of communications:
• Main office:
• 404.639.3286
• Staff organized into beats
• Conduct most telebriefings
• More contact with HHS
• Big-picture awareness

• Centers’ offices:
• Vast raft of phone numbers; get referred from main number
• Smaller staffs
• Closer to researchers

• Main office may refer to center offices - but center
PIOs are not necessarily junior to main office personnel

Structure of main Public Affairs
office
• Chief: Jana Telfer (acting)
• Senior officers (run beat teams)
• Junior officers, news assistants

• Senior officers and beats:
• Llelwyn Grant: NCID, OGH
• Kathy Harben: NCHSTP, NCEH, ATSDR, NIOSH
• Karen Hunter: NCCDPHP, NCBDDD, NCHS, OWH,
OMH
• Von Roebuck: NIP, NCIPHP, OTPR

Other points of entry
• Problems:
• Less access, closer control than in past
• No publicly accessible directory of staff

• Partial solutions:
• Significant Web presence
• Kludgy but thorough search function allows drilling
down
• <www.cdc.gov>

Routes to researchers, data
• CDC’s web site
• National Center for Health Statistics
• <www.cdc.gov/nchs>

• Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report
• Embargoed Thursday noon
• <www.cdc.gov/mmwr>

• Journal of Emerging Infectious Diseases

Additional advice
• Get to know state health department
• know whether CDC is operating within state
• do not need to answer to HHS
• likely to be more accessible to local publications

• Professional organizations can be helpful
• Association of State and Territorial Health Officers
• National Association of City and County Health
Officials
• Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists
• Association of Public Health Laboratories
