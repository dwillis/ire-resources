The following resources and obscure public records are among the best places to look for
information about how dark money groups are spending money in elections and who funds them.
Business records - for LLCs, nonprofits and corporations
● Charitable solicitation records - NC, FL, NY, CA, WV, CO, NY (among others) require lots of
information.
● State-level business documents - annual reports often list directors.
● IRS Form 1023/Form 1024 tax-exempt status application materials
● Court records
IRS Form 990s
● IRS exempt-organization business master file​ can help you ID the EIN of a dark money group
● IRS tax exempt organization search
● Foundation Center​/​Guidestar.org​ (merged in 2019 and now called Candid)
● CitizenAudit.org
● ProPublica’s Nonprofit Explorer
● Pro tip: Request 990s from the organization itself and ask for a (redacted) Schedule B, which
shows amounts each donor gave (while redacting the donors’ names).
○ In person request: Response required same day
○ In writing request: Response required within 30 days
● Pro tip: Request 990s or applications for exemption from the IRS using ​this form​ and ​faxing it​.
● List of ​notable past dark money donors that are nonprofits and when their next 990s are due

Other good ways to look for money flowing into dark money groups
