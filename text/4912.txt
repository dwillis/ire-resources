Rusty light poles pose danger across Chicago
CBS 2 - Chicago
By Dave Savini
http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2015/11/16/2-investigators-rusty-light-poles-a-danger-across-chicago/
*CBS2 got complaints about light poles that were old and rundown. So they went out and inspected them
and found not only poles that looked like they were ready to fall, but obtained records showing hundreds
of poles had fallen over the last 3 years resulting in dozens of injuries and private property damage costing
taxpayers hundreds of thousands in damage claims.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------City refuses to pay for fence damage caused by police
WFTS - Tampa Bay
By Adam Walser
http://www.abcactionnews.com/news/local-news/i-team-investigates/city-refuses-to-pay-for-fencebroken-by-police-officers-during-pursuit-of-suspect
Police tore down a section of a homeowner’s fence following a chase that ended with a suspect trapped in
their backyard. But when the homeowner filed the damage repair claim with the city, it refused to pay
citing state law saying it wasn’t liable. Most states have a law like this indemnifying government agencies
when damage occurs while performing certain government functions. You can take this story further by
requesting all unpaid liability claims in your city versus those paid. Under what circumstances is your
government liable for property damage it causes?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------How many emails are your leaders sending? And are some intentionally staying off the grid?
WDSU - New Orleans
By Travers Mackel
http://www.wdsu.com/news/local-news/new-orleans/iteam-new-orleans-mayor-sent-1-email-over3month-period-from-government-account/33152054
*Records shows the mayor sent just ONE email over a 3 month period. Are your city officials actually using
their government email address? You could also file a request to see what city officials are emailing and

texting about during city council meetings. And of course what their saying about particular issues or after
a story you’ve done about them.

WTVF - Nashville
By Phil Williams
http://www.newschannel5.com/news/newschannel-5-investigates/governors-private-email-used-forstate-business
Or you can take the email story to the state level like Phil in Nashville did. He discovered that Tennessee
Gov. Bill Haslam also has his own personal email system -- for him and his top aides. You can request even
a week’s worth of emails from any state official and see what kind of response you get or if the records
returned show redacted email addresses or address suffixes that aren’t consistent with state email
addresses.

WSB - Atlanta
By Jodie Fleischer
http://www.wsbtv.com/news/2-investigates/private-companies-set-up-shop-in-county-recordsroom/149550933
*After being tipped about this Jodie went down to the county Tax office to see what was going on. She
found that employees of 3 businesses had basically set up shop. They had hauled in fax machines, and
plugged into county phone lines. Desks had stamps, calculators, inboxes and stacks of paperwork on
company letterhead. Daily, They were trolling for property tax and title filings for real estate companies,
title officers, etc. ((all kinds of home service vendors have people camped out in clerk’s office looking for
new deed and title filings. They gather the info to send new homeowners solicitations. Check to see who’s
lurking in your county clerk’s office and what kind of information they’re gathering))

WTSP – Tampa Bay
By Noah Pransky
http://www.wtsp.com/news/local/whoops-florida-lawmakers-forget-to-vote-for-president/151773806
Noah checked county voting records to see if politicians actually voted for candidates they endorsed in the
March primary election. You can do this in any election cycle when politicians endorse candidates at any
level

KUTV - SALT LAKE CITY
By Matt Gephardt and Cindy St. Clair
http://kutv.com/news/get-gephardt/following-the-money-how-campaign-donations-are-spent-by-utahpoliticians

*It’s election year and a good “follow the money” story that can be done in any market using data from
the Federal Elections Commission. They broke down how much money the Utah congressional candidates
and officeholders were spending and who spent the most. It breaks down operational costs, travel
expenses, and what was being spent on meals and gifts.

Testing the accuracy of coin counting kiosks
WPVI – Philadelphia
By Wendy Saltzman
http://6abc.com/finance/the-accuracy-of-coin-counting-kiosks-in-question/1225094/
Acting on a viewer tip that they were short-changed $44 by a coin counter at a store, Wendy tested 17
kiosks at stores and banks and only 1 of them gave an accurate count. She also found local regulators only
inspect kiosks at stores, but not at banks.

WTHR – Indianapolis
By Bob Segall
http://www.wthr.com/story/31285468/sometimes-your-fitness-tracker-lies-a-lot-fitbit-jawbone-garminifit-misfit-accuracy
*WOO HOO! Your fitbit says you hit 10000 steps!! Or did you?? Bob Segal got help from a local human
performance lab (many universities have them) to test popular fitness trackers to show their deficiencies
and showed which functions of the fitness trackers measure most accurately...steps, calories, heart rate,
etc.

Med-spas are everywhere now offering everything from facials to face lifts, often in strip-mall
settings. Find the regulatory authority for Med-spas and request complaints and sanctions. Erick went to
his state medical board for complaints and found the main victim in this story.

WBBH - Fort Myers
By Bryan Anderson
http://www.nbc-2.com/story/30607699/nbc2-investigation-fake-service-animals#.V1m3trsrLRY
*Service dogs seem to be everywhere now, but it’s not just disabled people using them. While a new law in
Florida and many states make it illegal to pose your pet as a service animal, Bryan found it's extremely difficult to
enforce. And fake service animal gear is a big part of the problem. You can find plenty of websites offering service
animal gear that don’t require you to show certification. You can also find websites that’ll certify your dog as a service
dog to help you be able to take them to restaurants, shopping, on flights, etc.

KCRA - Sacramento
By Kevin Oliver
http://www.kcra.com/news/are-ear-plugs-needed-at-the-movies-kcra-3investigates/32548442#comments
The KCRA i-team got a complaint from a viewer about how loud the movies were...and they found even the
Hollywood Sound Engineers association says movies are played dangerously loud, particularly in kids'
movies. So, Kevin took a professionally calibrated decibel meter into theatres and found some dangerously
high decibel levels.

Energy slamming
KHOU - Houston
By Jeremy Rogalski
http://www.khou.com/news/investigations/direct-energy-leads-state-in-electricity-slammingrefunds/65322482
*Energy companies slammed consumers by switching their energy company without permission which can
cost them hundreds of dollars. Jeremy reviewed records and found that a Houston based company lead
the state of Texas in electricity slamming complaints and slamming refunds, but regulators had yet to take
any enforcement action against the business. This story is doable if your energy market is deregulated like
large portions of Texas where people can opt for private energy providers instead of government utilities.

PUBLIC SAFETY (8)
Unlicensed drivers and traffic deaths
KXAN – Austin
By Robert Maxwell
http://kxan.com/investigative-story/dangerous-drivers-getting-behind-the-wheel-without-a-license/
2015 was a record-breaking year for auto crash deaths in Austin. Of the 102 deadly crashes we found 1/3
of them involved a driver with a suspended or invalid license. Police citations data shows thousands of
drivers ticketed for driving without a valid license last year. Many are repeat offenders that continue to
drive. Most major cities in Texas impound cars driven by unlicensed drivers. But not Austin. The Austin
Police Department now backs a plan being considered by city council for tougher policies to curb the
problem, such as impounding cars of drivers with suspended or invalid licenses.

KGO – San Francisco
By Dan Noyes

http://abc7news.com/news/i-team-concerns-raised-about-old-ambulances-with-highmileage/1189569/
*Dan talked to paramedics concerned about the age and maintenance of the ambulances they have to
drive. He got records showing ambulances with as high as 400,000 miles and serious mechanical issues
putting patients and paramedics at risk.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Back from the dead: AED investigation
WRC - Washington DC
Tisha Thompson, Rick Yarborough, etc

http://www.nbcwashington.com/investigations/Back-From-the-Dead-AEDs-Can-Save-Your-Life---IfTheyre-Working-368529081.html
AED’s can save lives, if they’re working and if you can find them. Tisha and her team did a series on AED’s
(automated external defribulators) and talked to local fire, ems, and government officials about their
importance in public places. They also checked a hundred locations to make sure batteries were working
and found many of them weren’t. They also found sometimes they are not easy to find. You can check your
government buildings, schools, etc. See where they are legally required in your market, check the battery
indicator lights, and how visible and/or accessible they are.

KDVR – Denver
By Heidi Henmat
http://kdvr.com/2015/11/17/top-5-locations-where-auto-vs-pedestrian-crashes-happen-in-denver/
*Heidi analyzed 5 years’ worth of data and tracked locations of auto-ped accidents to find the top 5 hot
spots.

WOAI – San Antonio
By Jaie Avila
http://news4sanantonio.com/news/trouble-shooters/one-out-of-every-five-9-1-1-calls-in-san-antonionot-answered-by-person
Jaie got a tip from a police dispatcher that police were covering up slow answer times at the 9-1-1
communications center. But the one stat that they really couldn’t hide was “abandoned calls,” when
callers hang up before an operator answers. It is a leading indicator of problems at a call center. Jaie found
San Antonio’s abandoned call rate was 24% in January! Much higher than other cities. Operators are
supposed to call back abandoned calls quickly, but he learned due to staffing shortages some weren’t
being returned for hours.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*Malls with most car burglaries
WSB – Atlanta
By Dave Huddleston

http://www.wsbtv.com/news/2-investigates/which-local-malls-experience-the-most-car-breakins/149485876
Dave analyzed a year’s worth of police data and found where the most car break ins happened. They also
observed the locations to see if people were leaving items vulnerable to thieves and what security
measures are in place.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Walmart earning notoriety with police
KUSA – Denver
By Chris Vanderveen
http://www.9news.com/news/local/investigations/walmart-earning-notoriety-with-police/59199294
Chris used police data to find police responding to incidents at Denver area Walmart stores 2 – 4 times a
day on average. In some cases stores had more police calls than any other location in particular police
jurisdictions around Denver
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Out of state gun licenses
KPRC – Houston
By Joel Eisenbaum
http://www.click2houston.com/web/kprc/news/investigates/texans-take-out-of-state-courses-locallyto-get-license-to-carry-guns
*Most states have reciprocity agreements where your gun license in one state counts in others. Joel found
thousands of Texans getting licenses to carry guns by taking courses in other states and from online
courses. Often the rules of other states are not as strict and sometimes companies from those states, as
Joel found, solicit in stricter states like Texas. Joel did a stand up from the comfort of bed, demonstrating
how these tests don’t provide training on the actual handling of a gun.

ENVIRONMENTAL / HEALTH (5)
After national attention focused on the problem in Flint, Michigan several stations in different markets
worked to see if there was lead in their local water.
City delays notifying residents of lead in water
WKBN – Youngstown
By James Santelli and Chelsea Simeon
http://wkbn.com/2016/01/21/higher-than-normal-lead-levels-discovered-in-sebring-beloit-water/
James and his web producer, Chelsea, found it took five months for a city to notify its residents that they
had lead contaminated water. They searched the Ohio EPA website that showed the correspondence with
the water districts. He also did his own testing to check current levels and to show how long the turnaround
time is to find out. Check for water quality notifications sent to cities in your area and when the testing
was done.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------High lead levels in public water systems
KXAN – Austin
By Kevin Schwaller
http://kxan.com/2016/01/27/data-high-lead-levels-detected-in-travis-county-waters/

We got data from Tx Commission Environmental Quality showing contaminants found in public water
systems across the state. In this story we highlighted those in our viewing area.

WCMH – Columbus
By Duane Pohlman
http://nbc4i.com/2016/04/11/nbc4-investigates-danger-in-the-drinking-water-at-the-ohio-statehouse/
*Duane tested water in drinking fountains at the state capital and found dangerous levels of lead in the
water, prompting the state to test all drinking fountains at the Capitol, where more lead was
discovered. The House Speaker called for testing at major state office buildings, as well.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Public restroom hand dryers harbor dirty secrets
CBS2 - CHICAGO
By Dave Savini
http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2016/05/19/2-investigators-hand-dryer-harbors-dirty-secret/
Dave gathered samples and lab-tested the grime and gook found on hand dryers in public restrooms
around Chicago with help from an environmental lab at Loyola University. He found potentially dangerous
levels of several types of infectious bacteria.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Up in smoke
KNBC – Los Angeles
By Joel Grover
http://www.nbclosangeles.com/investigations/I-Team-LAX-Smoking-368069931.html
*Joel used a laser pointer to check distances of people smoking near doors of airport and baggage claims
and found many travelers breaking the law and smoking too close. Meanwhile, police were not citing the
violators or even asking them to move. You can certainly find this going on at any airport in cities with nonsmoking ordinances.

TxDOT fails to protect drivers from roadside bridge posts
KXAS - Dallas / Fort Worth
By Scott Friedman
http://www.nbcdfw.com/investigations/NBC-5-Investigates-TxDOT-Failing-to-Protect-Drivers-fromConcrete-Bridge-Posts-on-Freeways-380589081.html
Scott found places across the DFW metroplex where those giant bridge posts supporting highway
overpasses are dangerously close to the highway with no guardrails to help protect drivers in the event of
an accident. This despite the fact state and federal guidelines suggest guardrails should be in place if the
posts are a certain distance from the road to help reduce the risk of death in a crash. So, when these type

of wrecks happen in your area, especially if someone dies, double-check the situation and see if your DOT
couldn’t have done more to help prevent it by having the guardrails in place.

WJHL – Tri-Cities TN (Johnson City, Kingsport, Bristol)
By Nate Morabito
http://wjhl.com/2015/11/19/gps-data-110-instances-of-school-bus-speeding-in-washington-co/
*After a 2012 nearly fatal school bus wreck, a local school district installed GPS devices on its buses which
sends alerts when drivers are speeding. Nate discovered the school system only maintains the alerts for
two weeks, so he requested the data and all reprimands of drivers since the devices were installed in 2014.
They discovered buses still speeding and most drivers not getting punished. Nate also mapped all of the
locations where drivers were caught speeding. A lot of school districts have some sort of technology on
buses to track speed and location. Check districts in your viewing area.

WTVJ - Miami
By Tony Pipitone and McNelly Torres
http://www.nbcmiami.com/investigations/System-fails-to-keep-track-of-school-bus-drivers-traffic380536691.html

NBC 6 in Miami looked at 2,000 bus drivers in Broward and Miami-Dad County Public Schools. The
investigation found bus drivers entrusted with thousands of students are breaking traffic laws, but in
almost all these cases continued to work, even after committing serious traffic violations such as careless
driving, speeding or running traffic lights. They obtained red light camera video of buses running red lights
and driver safety records from the school district. They even found a driver with an invalid license. If you
want to learn how they did this story they have a link to a “how we did the story” page included.

Parking ticket hot spots
KTVT – Dallas/Fort Worth
By Brian New
http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2015/11/09/i-team-where-in-north-texas-youre-most-likely-to-get-a-parkingticket/
*Brian got parking citations data from cities of Dallas and Fort Worth and found locations and time frames
where people are most often cited.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Towing hot spots
KPRC – Houston
Jace Larson
http://www.click2houston.com/news/investigates/towing-hot-spots-to-be-revealed

Jace got police data showing all cars towed and found out where people are most likely to get towed. He
also showed viewers what to do to fight their towing bill if they think they were a victim of predatory
towing and not illegally parked.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------School zone speed traps
WTSP – Tampa Bay
By Noah Pransky
http://www.wtsp.com/news/school-zone-speed-traps/78260431
*Noah found school zones where improperly designed with speed limit signs not properly visible from the
road and placed where drivers don’t have enough warning to slow down. This put kids at risk while cops
were able to capitalize. If you get complaints about a dangerous school zone don’t just assume it’s because
of careless drivers. Check to see if the school zone is properly designed with signs that meet local or state
code.

Los Angeles’ hit and run epidemic
KNBC – Los Angeles
By Robert Kovacik and Phil Drechsler
http://www.nbclosangeles.com/investigations/Los-Angeles-LA-Hit-Run-Crash-Investigation-370821201.html

The I-team examined data reported to California Highway Patrol on all hit and run cases in Los Angeles
County and found it to have a hit and run crash rate 40% above the national average. They also plotted
the hit and run hot spots.

Thousands of flights violating noise program at Dallas Love Field Airport
KXAS - Dallas / Fort Worth
By Scott Friedman
http://www.nbcdfw.com/investigations/Hundreds-of-Flights-Violating-Noise-Program-at-Dallas-LoveField-After-Wright-Lifted-369868121.html
*Before you say, “But they live by an airport.” A good question to ask, “Does our airport have a noise
abatement program?” If it does, there maybe flights that are violating the program. They found that was
happening in Dallas. The airport said their goal was 80% compliance. What does 80% compliance sounds
like? 9 planes a night!

Light rail operators working long hours, speeding
KTSP - St. Paul / Minneapolis
By Farrah Fazal
http://kstp.com/news/metro-transit-light-rail-operators-investigation-accidents-speeding-longhours/4149830/?cat=5
Farrah looked into safety issues with light rail in the Twin Cities such as speeding trains, train operators
working double shifts, pedestrians ignoring warning signs. They obtained accident reports and other
records then compared policies and procedures at the Metro Transit agency in the Twin Cities to other

transit agencies around the country raising tough questions about how the Metro Transit system is
operated.

WATCHDOG / FOLLOW THE MONEY (8))
State swag spending
KHOU - Houston
By Jeremy Rogalski
http://www.khou.com/news/investigations/state-agencies-spend-millions-on-trinkets-watchdogcalls-junk/70887816
*Jeremy obtained records showing what different agencies were spending on swag for their employees
between September 2008 and December 2015 and found state agencies spent at least $8.8 million on
trinkets, doo-dads, and knickknacks that critics call junk.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Government unclaimed money
KHOU - Houston
By Scott Noll
http://www.khou.com/news/investigations/over-450000-unclaimed-by-houston-area-governmentschools/55423562
*Unclaimed funds. Every state always has money sitting waiting to be collected by people and businesses.
But the KHOU I-Team took a different spin on this story. We discovered hundreds of thousands of dollars
earmarked for state, local schools and governments sitting unclaimed sometimes for years. If your state
has an unclaimed property database online it’s easy to check for your local government agencies.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Unpaid restitution
KXAN - Austin
By Brian Collister
http://kxan.com/investigative-story/state-sitting-on-millions-owed-to-crime-victims/
KXAN obtained a list of crime victims owed the Travis County Probation Department claims it can’t find to
give them their money. But we had no problem finding many of them, including state lawmakers and even
the state comptroller who were once crime victims and owed money. KXAN also obtained records from the
state comptroller showing restitution amounts unpaid by each county in the state. We found the reason
probation and parole departments may not do more to find victims owed money is because they actually
profit from holding on to it. These agencies are allowed to keep a 5% fee once it goes to the state
comptroller after 5 years.

KXAN – Austin
By Brian Collister
http://kxan.com/investigative-story/taxpayers-footing-questionable-attorney-bills-da-investigating/
Travis County pays out about $7.2 million a year to fund the indigent defense system. We wanted to know
if taxpayers are actually getting their money’s worth from court appointed attorneys. We got data from
the county auditor showing court appointed attorney payments and first looked at the billing invoices of
the highest paid attorney. We found cases where he billed for jail visits when there was no record of him
being there on jail visitation logs. We also interviewed and wrote to inmates. The DA started an
investigation while we were still getting records on the rest of the top paid attorneys, which made the
remaining records we requested unreleasable. But we were able to do a story focusing on the top paid
guy.

*It’s always good to check for missing, lost, stolen inventory at your local and state government. For this story Jarrod
requested the city’s data showing the missing items and which departments they’re lost from. Some of the items
you’ll find missing from government agencies can be pretty perplexing and entertaining.

City employee accidents cost taxpayers
WNCN – Raleigh / Durham
By Jonathon Rodriguez
http://wncn.com/2015/07/21/accidents-involving-city-of-raleigh-property-costing-taxpayers/
Jonathon filed a public records request for all liability claims against the city of Raleigh and found taxpayers
cover about $5Million a year in claims paid when city workers get in wrecks in city vehicles or damage
people’s property doing work for the city.

Lee found public employees/officials purchase hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of flights each
year. Some of those flights go unused. Instead of using tickets later that year, or transferring to another
employee, the state is letting some of the tickets expire wasting thousands of taxpayer dollars.

Faking the grade - standardized testing in metro-schools
CBS Newschannel 5 Nashville
By Phil Williams

http://www.newschannel5.com/news/newschannel-5-investigates/making-the-grade/timeline-metroschools-investigation
*Since November, Phil Williams has been taking a deep look at Metro Nashville Public Schools testing
policy revealing some schools were faking grades and manipulating testing scores , producing more than
20 reports on the issue. If your state has standardized testing take a look to see what you can do in your

Alyssa looked at the social media/texting policies for all the school districts in their area to see if teachers
are prohibited from sending students private messages. Several districts had no policy. The expert in her
story explained why those with policies weren’t strict enough. Alyssa also looked at complications with
legislating student / teacher communications.

KXAN – Austin
Brian Collister
http://kxan.com/investigative-story/central-texas-teachers-often-struggle-becoming-certified/
We obtained teacher certification test score data from the state certification board and found lots of
teachers in our local school districts failing certification tests numerous times and not being fully certified
to teach the subjects they currently teach. We even found principals running schools with “probationary
certifications” who failed their principal exams numerous times. In Texas students only get 3 tries to pass
their standardized tests. But teachers get unlimited number of chances to pass their certification tests. I
think

NBC4 Los Angeles
By Jenna Susko
http://www.nbclosangeles.com/investigations/LAUSD-Rents-Out-Schools-for-Racy-Entertainment331119442.html
*Obviously in LA there’s a lot of filming and photography for commercials, tv shows, and movies in public
schools. Jenna found a lot of it unmonitored by school officials as crews used public schools to film racy
scenes, often disrupting classes. But it’s not just in LA. Most schools and universities charge a location fee
to film at their campus. Check with school districts and college campuses in your area to see if they have a
location fee and get a list of vendors to see what type of filming they’re doing. Also request internal
communications to see what administrators are saying about the shoots.

Houston PD fails to have fingerprints analyzed
KHOU – Houston
By Jeremy Rogalski
http://www.khou.com/news/investigations/i-team-hpd-sitting-on-crucial-evidence/189830542

*Jeremy obtained and reviewed 2 years’ worth of Houston Police Department records. The records showed
that there were 4451 crimes with recovered fingerprint evidence. 56% of those cases, police didn’t submit
them for lab analysis, leaving cases unsolved and victims without justice. For the second part we looked
at how long it took for the lab to process evidence that was turned over in.

Police PR spending
KMGH – Denver
By John Ferrugia
http://video-kmgh-scripps-yahoopartner.tumblr.com/post/139468779714/denver-police-defendspending-more-than-13
John obtained records showing police PR expenses and found Denver Police Department spending more
than $1.3Million on public relations staffing, video production gear, advertising promotions, social media
boosts, and even thousands on Emmy award entries. Money that’s supposed to be used for police training
and equipment. Every city has some sort of PR campaign and often across several departments. File a
request with your city and see what they’re spending and how.

http://www.nbcbayarea.com/investigations/Unaccounted-For-Hundreds-of-Guns-Lost-or-Stolen-FromBay-Area-Police-Agencies-Since-2010-350768311.html
*NBC Bay Area uncovered hundreds of guns missing from Bay Area law enforcement agencies, stolen from
officers’ homes and vehicles, or simply lost somehow by the officers. In this story Stephen highlights the
death of a young woman shot by someone in possession of a lost police weapon. You can check for
lost/stolen weapons from local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies in your area. You can also
run serial numbers of lost/stolen guns through ATF Trace data to see if they’ve been recovered in
connection with other crimes.

KUSA - Denver
By Jeremy Jojola
www.9news.com/news/local/investigations/colorados-biggest-little-traffic-ticket-farm/132377024
Jeremy and his team did an extensive analysis of 270 town budgets showing that while most town’s ticket
revenue averaged about 4 % of the budget there were several towns that that’s budget heavily relied on
writing tickets. Including one small town where 93% of their budget came from traffic enforcement. That
was just the tip of the iceberg for this series but you can take a look. Some states have an office of court
administration of some sort that collects data on traffic citations for each city and the amount of revenue
from those citations. In some states like Texas cities of certain sizes are only allowed a certain percentage
of revenue from traffic citations.

http://kstp.com/news/twin-cities-officers-lack-key-mental-health-training-phil-quinn/4056634/?cat=5
*A police shooting of a schizophrenic man highlighted in this story helps illustrate the lack of training across
Minnesota police officers receive to deal with mentally ill suspects. This report found six out of seven police
officers in the Twin Cities lack a key form of mental health training. Experts say mandatory training in
mental health response would better protect officers and the mentally ill. You can check out the level and
degree of training police officers in your area get, especially when news breaks of a shooting involving a
mentally ill person.

NBC Bay Area
By Vicky Nguyen
http://www.nbcbayarea.com/investigations/Data-Shows-How-Often-Body-Cams-Record-During-Use-ofForce-Incidents-368365771.html
With police use of force incidents under more scrutiny than ever, body-worn cameras are becoming more
prevalent to better document use of force incidents. But they’re no good if they’re not turned on. Vicki
found some police departments don’t track when officers turn the cameras on and off. If your local police
has body cams this is something you can check out in your market.

KXAN – Austin
By Brian Collister
http://kxan.com/investigative-story/texas-troopers-ticketing-hispanics-motorists-as-white/
http://kxan.com/investigative-story/kxan-investigation-prompts-audit-of-apd-citations-race-data/
KXAN obtained data showing more than 16 million traffic citation records dating back to 2010, from the
Texas Department of Public Safety and found state troopers inaccurately recording the race of large
numbers of minority drivers, mostly Hispanic, as white. In fact, the top 5 names of drivers stopped and
documented as white had traditionally hispanic names. Experts say what we found shows the agency's
racial profiling reports are likely flawed. We found the same problem at the Austin Police Department. 30
other states have racial profiling laws and reporting requirements. If your state is one of them you can do
this story. Even if your state doesn't have such laws then you can still check to see if law enforcement is
stopping a disproportionate number of minorities. Brian and I will be showing this story and providing all
the background on this series of stories in Deep Dives 3 session today at 3pm.

KDVR – Denver
By Chris Halsne
http://kdvr.com/2015/11/11/rough-rides-no-seatbelts-abrupt-braking-injures-handcuffed-sheriff-vanpassengers/
*Chris looked into how Denver sheriff’s deputies treated arrestees during transport from Denver’s
entertainment districts.He found deputies don’t fasten seatbelts or harnesses on arrestees being
transported to jail. A lot of them were seriously injured. They also watched and got video as people arrested
for public intoxication were put into vans but never seatbelted. He also explored cases where these rough
rides cost the city money in legal claims. It’s a good question for any local police department: Do you seat
belt van passengers? How many injuries occur during transport?

http://www.11alive.com/news/local/investigations/the-investigators-safe-but-notsecure_20160225065811718/55528897
*Brendan tested hotels to see how easy someone could access a safe in your hotel room. Hotel staff didn’t
ask him for identification when he asked for help getting into his hotel room safe. They used master codes
that apparently don’t get changed and he found he was able to override guest codes time after time. He
also shows a couple other ways in which safe’s are vulnerable.

KPRC – Houston

http://www.click2houston.com/news/investigates/hidden-camera-investigation-uncovers-used-carodometer-rollback
This story is still alive and well just about anywhere. And as they were years ago, Carfax is willing to help.
KPRC got complaints for the Houston area from Carfax and then focused on a dealership that was
advertising low mileage used cars that turned out to have many more miles on them. Carfax is usually
friendly about a free trial account to check mileage of cars for sale. They went undercover and caught a
dealership employee lying about mileage on several occasions.

NBC4 - Los Angeles
By Joel Grover
http://www.nbclosangeles.com/investigations/Los-Angeles-Valet-Service-Parking-Meters-LAPD380533111.html
*Joel found a problem he uncovered back in 2009 is still a problem...valets hogging up metered spots on
the street meant for public use. They caught employees of 3 major valet services with hidden cameras
charging people the valet price and parking on the public street instead of their own private lots, as
required by law. The companies were not permitted to use these spots. Downtown parking is a problem in
just about any medium to large city. Is this going on in your city’s hot spots?
