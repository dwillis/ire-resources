Developing an

Investigative Mindset
LISE OLSEN

JOSH HINKLE

Develop new routines
Arrive early to news conferences
Think: what are they not telling you?
Investigations don’t always mean lengthy projects.
Re-visit general assignment stories that deserve a deeper look. Look for solid, unique follow-ups.
Put together an idea file and work on your ideas on slow days.

Find mentors
• Find others interested in investigative journalism and brainstorm.
• Work to define what “investigative” means for your newsroom.
• Seek outside feedback, then discuss with your boss and/or mentors.
• Develop a pitch and sell it to your boss – think how it will impact your
community & separate you from competitors.

Brainstorm Methods & Solutions
Records denied? Don’t give up!
• What was the agency’s reason?
• Do the records even exist?
• Can you ask in a different way?
• Think beyond what’s electronic.
• Have a plan and pitch it!

Hitting Roadblocks
•

Don’t take “no” for an answer.

•

Is the denial discretionary? Does
another agency have the info?

•

Practice your accountability
interview, role play, and
prioritize questions.

•

Be respectful but make it clear
that you will report difficulty in
obtaining information.

Some of the easiest investigations begin with someone who
breaks a rule.

-The professor who doesn’t really have that PhD.

LOOK FOR THE
RULE BREAKERS

-The crime rate that the school or the city reports is bogus
-The state senator who wants property tax reform doesn’t pay
taxes.

Find sources!
-Listen, Read, Ask questions – what doesn’t make sense?
- Find the liars, rule-breakers and tax evaders.
- Get to know the leaders, the gossips, the auditors,
nerds, whistleblowers, internal investigators,
Title 9 coordinators. Meet for coffee or lunch.
- Visit offices in-person
- Explore little-known archives – complaint files,
whistleblowers’ lawsuits
- Follow the money. Who’s getting it? Who’s not? Why?

Here are some starting points:

Find a good idea
and then develop
an investigative
plan

1. Who is lying?
2. If there are two different versions, which is right?
3. What are rules and who’s breaking them?

Look for relationships and follow the money!

Finding the Investigation
• Map out your tactics.
• Have a goal.
• Be open to changes.
• Prepare to wait.
• Set calendar deadlines.
• Doublecheck… with help.

Finding hidden truths and omissions can be harder. What
doesn’t make sense to you?

Find hidden
truths and
omissions

What is your central hypothesis? Then ask more questions.
Don’t just do phone interviews, talk to the people who know.
Request records. Compare versions.
Your story lead to something you don’t expect…
