Basic Terms
CMS
Content Management System, aka what do you use to
“manage” content on your website? Every newsroom
has a CMS and many times they’re called different
things. Ex: Wordpress
Command Line
A place to type (extremely powerful) commands to your
computer. On Macs, it can look like the picture below.
Some programming requires you to use the command
line.

OpSec
OpSec is short for Operational Security. As a journalist,
what should you be doing to make sure your sources
are protected from a software digital privacy
perspective?

Coding
Code is just a way for us to talk to computers. Just as
there are many languages in real life for us to talk to
each other, there are many programming languages
that can talk to computers.
If a website is just made out of boxes of text and
images...
HTML Is how many boxes are on the page (a box for
headlines, a box for each paragraph, etc.)
CSS is how those boxes should looks (what’s the
background color? how tall should the box be?)

Scraping
Using a computer script to extract information from
websites. Think of it as a more complicated way to copy
and paste things off the Internet.
RSS
A way to read a website via a “feed” or basically a list of
all the most recent items published by a website. Ex:
http://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/index.html

JS/Javascript - is how and when those boxes should
move or change (clicking next on a slideshow animates
the next picture into view)
 If you learn Javascript, you’ll run into things like
AngularJS and Backbone
 jQuery - A very popular javascript library that
helps you write Javascript more quickly and
efficiently

Modeling
Usually refers to statistical or mathematical modeling.
Models are usually developed by scientists or
researchers to help us understand how a system works.

Ruby, Python
Two very common programming languages. Unlike
HTML/CSS/JS, neither Ruby or Python have a focus on
websites. Instead, you can almost use them to program
anything you want.

AWS
Short for Amazon Web Services. You can pay to have
Amazon host your website.

NodeJS
Very similar to Ruby and Python, but it uses Javascript
syntax.

PyQuery
JQuery-like library, but for Python

Hexbin
A way to group data together using hexagons.

For example...once you start coding projects with
HTML/CSS/JS, you’ll find that you repeatedly have to do
the same things over and over again. That’s when you
start using things like...
Rails, Django
These are called “frameworks.” They help you use Ruby
and Python to build templates that can generate
hundreds or thousands (or millions) of webpages on the
Internet.
API
An easier way for computers to read a website. Many
companies make APIs for their websites so that other
programmers can use their company data to make cool
projects. Ex: Twitter
Grunt
A program that helps you preview and test the HTML,
CSS and Javascript you write, to make sure everything
works and that you’re writing good code.

Data Types
There are many different computer formats that data
can come in. Usually these are interchangeable and
data can be converted from one format to another.
CSV
Where commas separate each one data point from
another
XML
Where <tags><that><look><like><this> separate data
points from each other
JSON
How Javascript likes its data structured

Visualization
Tableau, Plotly
Websites or computer programs you can use to make
data visualizations. No coding necessary.
D3/d3.js
A javascript library that lets users manipulate data
easily. Usually this means people use it to visualize data.

Mapping
GIS
Stands for “Geographic information system.” A way for
computers to understand data as it relates to a location
on Earth.
ESRI
The company that owns ArcGIS.
ArcGIS
A very popular, powerful, and expensive computer
program that allows you to make maps.
QGIS
An open-source and free mapping program.
Tilemill
Software that helps you make and publish maps to the
Internet.
Leaflet, Polymaps
Two javascript libraries that help you make maps online.
Mapbox
The company behind Tilemill and Leaflet.
Fusion Tables
A google service that allows you to upload data and
make maps using Google Maps.

CartoDB
A website where you can make your own maps and
publish them online. Has free and paid tiers.

Data Analysis

Two websites that let you preview and test out HTML,
CSS and Javascript, and save and share your code
online.
Tabula
Free software that helps you extract data out of PDFs.

SQL
A label for any language that is built specifically for
managing databases.

GitHub
A website that allows you to share, track changes, and
collaborate on code.

MySQL
A very popular database management system.

StackOverflow
A popular Q&A website focused on questions
specifically about programming.

SQLite
Software that creates an embeddable SQL database,
allowing you to make a database without a server.
PostgreSQL
An even more advanced SQL database management
system.
pgAdmin
The admin interface for PostgreSQL
Index
Verb and a noun. “Indexing” a database will make your
database easier to search through. Once you’re done
indexing, your database will have an “ index.”
Regular Expressions
Find and replace on steroids. A sequence of characters
that that forms a search pattern. You can search for
anything, such as “five characters in a row that are all
numbers.”
OpenRefine
Free and powerful software used to clean messy data.

Websites/Services/
Products
DocumentCloud
A website that allows you to upload, share and
annotate PDFs online. Created by journalists!
Google Analytics
A website created by Google that helps anyone analyze
traffic to their website.
CodePen, JSFiddle

PANDA
Software that allows you to search through all of your
stashed data sets.

Networking Analysis
Social Network Analysis
Using network theory to analyze social networks, such
as how individuals in networks are connected,
distributed or segmented.
NetworkX
A Python language software package for the creation,
manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and
functions of complex networks.
Gephi
Software that helps users visualize and explore complex
networks.

Sensor Journalism
Sensor Journalism
Using physical sensors to do journalism projects. Ex:
Using air quality sensors to find out air quality all over a
city.
Arduino, RasberryPi
Two similar types of hardware (that comes with
software) that you can buy and program, to use as
sensors.

Statistics
Regression
A statistical technique that estimates the relationship
between variables

SPSS
Software you can purchase that does statistical analysis.
Monte Carlo Simulation
A probability simulation of a given data set —
simulating what outcome you might get, based on the a
set of possible outcomes and the probability of getting
those outcomes.
R
A free programming language and environment for
statistical computing and graphics.
R Studio
Free software that provides a nice environment around
R to help you use it better.
