In-House Databases
Death Database: An electronic collection of death certificates - often available at the
state level. Contains valuable fields for raw data on disease and trauma-related deaths.
Birth Database: An electronic collection of birth certificates. May be a bit harder to find
with tougher privacy policies.
Public Employee Database: A great collection of information on public employees for
all levels of government (municipal, county, state). This is data that can be utilized in
breaking news situations, long-term investigative pieces and to develop sources.
Remember to ask for more than just name and compensation in your request. Include
DOBs, date of hire, title and department.
Criminal/ Civil Court Database: An electronic index of court cases including
defendant name, case number, charge, date of initial filing, and adjudication data.
Public Agency Checkbooks: Several years of the Accounts Payable database from
public agencies - essentially, every check written by the agency. Ask for check number,
vendor, amount, invoice date, pay date, department, and account code.
Recent Termination Database: Many public agencies maintain a list of recent
employee terminations (firings, lay offs, retirements). This is a great place to find
sources. Be sure to ask for termination codes.
Fire Inspection Database: Many fire departments now keep their inspection data in
electronic form. The data may yield an interesting investigative piece on inspection
efficiency and public safety as well as a data set valuable in breaking news situations.
Foreclosure Database: Another set of useful and unique data that could spark an
interesting story.
Cell Phones: Compiling a list of public employees assigned cell phones - so you always
have their number.
Day Care Center Inspection Database: Vital data on an industry important to
viewers/readers.

Government Vehicles Database: Having a database of "rolling stock" owned by
taxpayers will eventually come in handy. Be sure to ask for make, model, license and
assignation.
Public Agency Contracts Database: Another treasure-trove of public financial data and
information on decision making by officials.
Sex Offenders Database: Having it in-house will win you at least one breaking news
story.
Professional Licenses: State regulatory agencies keep an electronic database of those
they license - MDs; dentists; real estate agents; etc. This is great data to have on-hand,
analyze, and match.
