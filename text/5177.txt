Finding stories: Vulnerable and Voiceless
IRE – Phoenix 2017
Michael J. Berens – Chicago Tribune
Some information sources harbor countless story possibilities. Here’s a rough map to a rich trove
of enterprise and watchdog stories – a destination different in each state – where X marks a littleknown federal program devoted to the mass relocation of tens of thousands of vulnerable adults.
Since 2007, the U.S. Department of Human Services, via the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
Services, has doled out billions of dollars to “rebalance” people with disabilities, mental illness
and seniors. It’s a laudable goal. Move people from expensive big-box facilities into cozy
community-based options, like group homes or subsidized apartments among many options. The
philosophy: Big is bad, small is good.
Fittingly, perhaps, the federal program is called Money Follows the Person.

But in many states, this massive relocation effort has been fraught with failure.
Step 1: The MFP program is evaluated by federal contractor Mathematica Policy Research
(https://mathematica-mpr.com/). Review reports involving 43 states and the District of
Columbia. Not surprisingly, reports generally paint a picture of success. Don’t ignore footnotes
that detail potential trouble spots: “New Mexico and Florida had no transitions through the
program, rescinding grant awards in January 2012 and August 2013 respectively. Oregon
inactivated their program in 2011 and officially closed out the grant in September 2016.”
Here is the most recent national report: (https://www.mathematica-mpr.com/our-publicationsand-findings/projects/research-and-evaluation-of-the-money-follows-the-person-mfpdemonstration-grants)
Step 2: Review state grant applications. This is a blueprint for how many people will be
relocated to the community and where. Each state adopts a different strategy. Nationally, more
than 80,000 low-income adults have been moved to date. Does your state rely on for-profit group
homes or subsidized apartments, or do they pay families to take in relatives or build small
boarding homes? There are many variations.
Step 3: Understand the rules. In Illinois for instance, the federal grant money pays for enhanced
housing and social services for just one year. All state officials agree to pick up costs after a year.
Many don’t. Some states, like Illinois, contract with a public university to help provide training
and oversight. File public record requests. The University of Illinois at Chicago, for instance,
maintained a detailed database that tracked the outcomes of every person moved – at least for the
first year. The data revealed scores of unnecessary deaths.

Step 4: Be prepared to pivot. The broad MFP program may be a launch pad to a more focused
story. In Seattle, as I reviewed federal records, I realized the state was using the grant to steer
seniors into residential homes owned by people with no health care experience; owners were
allowed up to six boarders (http://old.seattletimes.com/html/seniorsforsale/). In Illinois, federal
money was used to move adults with disabilities into group homes operated by nonprofit groups
with disastrous results: (http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/watchdog/grouphomes/).
Step 5: Question conventional wisdom, listen to all sides, and prepare for significant push back.
Few topics generate more fervor and passion among social advocates. There are organizations
devoted to closing down every state-operated developmental center. There are advocacy groups
fighting to keep them open. Some maintain that community-based living is always better than a
big facility. Look how the Star Tribune expertly grappled with this in Minnesota:
(http://www.startribune.com/a-matter-of-dignity-a-five-day-special-report/339820912/)
Investigative tip: Citing patient privacy, many states refuse to divulge the addresses of licensed
group homes. In Illinois, I obtained fire safety inspection data that delineated group homes from
other kinds of facilities to locate nearly 12,000 wards inside state-licensed and publicly-funded
group home businesses.
FOIA tip: Many states routinely deny requests as too burdensome. Outside of deadline
situations, I often request just one month of investigative reports to make it virtually impossible
for the state to deny on these grounds, and I can quickly access the value of the document. Then
file for a big chunk of records.
