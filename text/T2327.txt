We must admit that we're somewhat innumerate. Our excuses:
No math required by my j-school.
We wear math ignorance as badge of honor.
We've got our nerd in the newsroom.
My source will give me the numbers we need.
Numbers are hard, solid, cold facts - what else do Ineed t o know?
Numeracy
Numbers are a summary of the real world.
Many numbers are a guess.
Many numbers are an opinion.
Writing with numbers
No more than two or three numbers in a paragraph.
No more than one, maybe two, paragraphs in a row with numbers.
Dates, time, spelled-out numbers count.
Memorize common numbers on your beat. Think is this number up or down,
big or small.
Round off - and then maybe round off so more.
Learn to convert to simple ratios to keep your numbers small.
Keep your bases similar; compare similar numbers.
Learn to round off, not chop off.
Use precise language, but don't try to make your numbers more precise than
they really are.
So ... When all the above fails, numbers belong in graphics - bar charts,
tables and at last resort a bulleted break out box.
Graphics, graphics, graphics
Take your graphic artist or graphic reporter t o lunch.
Do your calculations and bar charts in Excel, then export to Adobe Illustrator
or Freehand.
Learn some principles of good graphics t o have quality conversations with
your graphic folks.
