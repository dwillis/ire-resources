Tor

• Anonymized internet access so websites don’t

know where you are
●
Great for research so websites don’t know you
visited them & your ISP doesn’t know either.

• Relays your web traffic through random computers
before trying to access the website

• Caveats:
• Slower than normal browsing
• Relays may see your browsing (if not HTTPS),
since they are relaying it on behalf of you. (Be
careful with logins!)

Tor
PC/Mac: https://www.torproject.org/
iOS: Onion Browser (disclosure: I work on this)
Android: Orbot

Chat: OTR Encryption
• “Off The Record” encryption protects messages

between you and someone else.
●
Not the same as Google “Off The Record” mode

• Use an existing account (like GChat or others) &

use an OTR plugin to encrypt.
●
You can register an account at other chat services
too, to avoid Google knowing about your chats.

• Caveats:
• Metadata – who you are talking to and when – is
still seen by the chat service.

OTR Encryption

OTR Encryption
Tor Messenger provides OTR encryption and lets you
use accounts on many messaging services (Google
Chat, Twitter DMs, XMPP/Jabber).
●
In addition to OTR, it uses Tor to mask your IP
address.
●
ChatSecure is similar, but for iPhone and Android.
●

Remember: to use OTR, your friend also needs to use
Tor Messenger (or another app that does it).

Encrypted Texts
• Signal (iOS & Android)
• iMessage (iOS) claims to encrypt messages, but

Apple may have access to the messages.
●
Phone provider doesn’t se messages anymore, but
Apple has the metadata of who you communicate
with.

Phone Calls
• Signal (iOS & Android)

• SilentCircle ($$$, iOS & Android)
• FaceTime (iOS): Like iMessage.
●

Prevents cell provider from knowing who you
call. But again, Apple may have access to the
metadata and actual call.

PGP
Also known as GPG — for “GnuPG”, one of the
programs that does this
Public and private keys, you have to know
someone's public key to send them an
encrypted message.
Also lets you “sign” messages so recipient can
tell whether it was tampered with while in
transit.

PGP

• Mac:

Thunderbird+ Enigmail
or GPGTools + Mail app

• Windows:

Thunderbird+ Enigmail
or GPG4Win + Outlook

• Setup guides:

But what about other
tools?
• New tools come out all the time.
• We don’t necessarily know what’s secure. Follow
a lot of security experts to see what their
consensus is.

• Consider the encryption, metadata-masking

capabilities, and transparency of how tools work:
