The story

Your computer

How it ought to be

You

Here's when it hit me

That's news!!!

Teach me how to Dougie!

Find a simple, repetitive and moving data stream

Do standard pull and parse, but put it on loop.

- What has happened lately?
You again

- What is trending in short term?
- What is typical over long term?
- What are the outliers?
- How do entities compare?
- Have newsmakers been active?
- What matches other data sets?
- Answer me! I'm a newspaperman!

Train it to answer the questions you would ask

This doesn't have to be complicated

Train the system to send you alerts

Make a dashboard to drilldown

Train it to write a nut graf...

...which comes out like this.

WHAT DO I GET OUT OF IT?

BREAKING NEWS

A WAY AROUND PIOs

INSTANT ANALYSIS

AUTOMATED COPY

OPPORTUNITIES

- Environmental data

- Legislatures
