Migration is people voting with their feet. Covering migration is the fastest way to focus on how your
community came to look the ways it does, or to look at where it’s headed. A note on terms: Demographers usually
call migration across national borders “immigration” or “emigration.” Movement inside national borders is
“migration,” or “domestic migration.” Even in areas of the United States with lots of immigration, migration – or its
absence is still important.
Here are some of the ways and data sources to cover migration locally:
-- The Census Bureau’s new American Community Survey makes it easy to track local migration rates each
year. The basic table, B07003, shows migration by sex for people who are living in the same house as a year ago, or
who moved within the county; from elsewhere in the state; from elsewhere in the country; and from abroad. Other
tables (B07001 through B07014, B07101 and B07202) break down the previous year’s migrants by age, race,
education, poverty status, household income and more. One in that series is tallied separately for each race
(B07004A through –I), so you can look separately at the non-Hispanic whites or Asian-Americans flowing into a
given area.
So far, data is only available for 2003 and 2004 for cities and counties over 250,000, plus the states. Beginning
with 2005 data released this summer, you will find these breakdowns for anything with more than 65,000 people.
Starting in 2008, averaged 2005-07 data will be published for any place with at least 20,000 people.
To get the data, go to factfinder.gov, click on the “Data sets” link in left column and choose the 2004 American
Community Survey.
-- We call daily migration “commuting.” It is strongly shaped by housing prices and job locations. In turn, it
shapes longer-term migrations as people change jobs, traffic worsens and urban areas sprawl. The 2004 ACS data is
the first standard Census report to tally people by where the work, not just by where they live. It offers 22 tables of
this kind, including one – how people get to work -- in which they are tallied separately by race (B080505Athrough –I). So you can look at the income breakdowns of people who walk to work (B08519) or the education
breakdown of carpoolers (B08517) or the male-female breakdown of bus commuters (B08406), among others.
-- IRS county-to-county migration data. Not easy to work with, but worth the effort. It’s unusual because it
specifies both the “to” and “from” for each flow. (The ACS data above, for example, is typical. It details the “to”
but not the “from.” It tells you where people went to live or work, but it doesn’t specify where they came from
except in general categories.) The IRS data shows the number of households and people flowing into and out of
each county from each other county for each year. The IRS also attached an aggregate and median household
income figure to each flow (http://www.irs.gov/taxstats/indtaxstats/article/0,,id=96816,00.html). Your best bet is to
buy it from the NICAR database library, which does a good job of simplifying the file structure, flagging embedded
subtotals and geocoding the data so that you can map it.

-- Look for local and off-beat sources. Some state motor vehicle agencies tally change-of-address data on
drivers’ licenses for people moving within the state. School districts can provide ZIPs of new students. In 2003, the
Plain-Dealer obtained current ZIPs for 1990s alumni of 23 Ohio universities, along with their year of graduation,
major and degree type (http://www.cleveland.com/braindrain/). ZIP counts are great for looking at migration
because they are easy to map and typically don’t generate privacy squawking when you ask for them. What if you
mapped the home ZIPs of your local teachers now and 10 years ago?
