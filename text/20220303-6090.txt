Session information
Working with data from the judicial system is notoriously challenging, from
antiquated information practices to minimal if any obligation to comply with
records requests. In this panel, representatives of two projects aimed at making
federal court data easier to access and analyze will talk about general issues
journalists should know and provide a bit of an introduction to their tools.
Joe Germuska (moderator) is the Chief Nerd (Executive Director) of
Northwestern University Knight Lab, the media/technology/design studio at
the Medill School of Journalism. He is also the founder and project lead for
Census Reporter, a service to make US Census data easy for journalists. Before
Knight Lab, Joe was, among other things, a founding member of the News
Applications team at the Chicago Tribune.
