The rules are different – but similar way of working to get data in countries
Many US journalists know how to work for data in US. We have experienced in Denmark that the
rules of access may be different round the world, but the methods for working are the same.
Getting data
Many authorities and organisations are really open to cooperate with medias. First lesson is to ask
for data. Take it for sure you get them. This is working well many places. Also if you present how
you wish them to present data on the net, they will often listen and do as you wish.
Focus on fighting single cases – be persistent
Still there are some very closed authorities, bad rules etc. Cope with this in a professional way.
Work together with press law expert. Focus on single cases and go through to the end. Go for
winning cases.
Wishes for data
l Meetings and files from meetings at parliaments and local authorities – open democracy.
l All kind of plans.
l Budgets and spendings.
l Incoming and outgoing mail and an overview of the list of files at authorities.
l Databases and description of content. Editing should be possible and delivery on a standard
format. Free of charge or very inexpensive.
l List of all exclusions of access.
l Building a fast working and one-string system for complaints.
Do your work
It seems quite strange, but very often medias are writing about stories and discussions without
getting the facts. Try to find them. Ask for them. Do your work.
