Master the system and its lingo: Children’s court and the juvenile system is different
than the adult system. Learn the language and understand that there is a difference
between a delinquency petition (for children) and a criminal complaint (for adults). Being
expert in the system will help you hold it accountable. Challenge officials to defend their
decisions.
Source development: start with usual suspects – judges, prosecutors, probation and
intake workers, corrections and community-based organizations. Go deeper to retired
judges and other staff, police, school officials, court psychologists. Think who outside the
system has knowledge of it.
Records: learn the law in your state on access. Some records open retroactively if the
juvenile is found delinquent on a second felony offense. Scour files to build
accountability chain. Also ask for CHiPs files (children in need of protective services).
These will help show what was done to help the family. Look for history in adult court
documents such as pre-sentence investigations, mental health reports and motions
including jail recordings.
Get organized: keep track of documents through electronic or manual storage (doc cloud
and binders work for me.) This will help fact-checking
Question assumptions: Challenge system and officials in it. Ie Question recidivism
rates. Are they counting children who age out as non-repeaters?
