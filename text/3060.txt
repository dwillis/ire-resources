A do-it-yourself database can generate some of the most interesting and revealing
journalism around, but the process of creating one can be intimidating for firsttimers. With some thought, planning and mid-course corrections, a home-built
database can result in strong investigative pieces or a useful tool for the years
ahead. Or both.
 Question No. 1: “Why am I doing this myself?” Are you reasonably
certain that the resulting data will reveal solid information, or is it a
fishing expedition? Since entering data from paper documents is always
tedious and sometimes costly, it helps to be reasonably certain the effort
will be rewarded with a good story. Is there an existing database that
could be enhanced instead?
 Who will enter the data? You, or other staff members? Hired help?
Staffers who are assigned to the miserable task of entering data, but who
have no interest in the story, are more likely to make typos and other
mistakes when entering information. Someone to need to check his or
her work. Data entry services are good, but can be costly. (Putting a
college intern or a temp on the job could be embarrassing if the story
ends in a lawsuit, especially if someone goofed. Imagine explaining on
the witness stand that numbers for the most important story of the year
was put in the hands of a novice). Consider using double-key entry.
Costly, but it’ll save hours of proofreading.
 What type of software is required? Many newspaper projects are
possible with a simple Excel spreadsheet. More complicated projects
might require linking several tables in a database manager such as

1

Microsoft Access or MySQL, which will require someone skilled with
those programs.
 Before beginning data entry, sit down with everyone involved in the
project and decide what data must be entered into the database. It’ll be
your best guess – remember to remind everyone you can make changes
later.
 Consider using keycode tables instead of text. How many different ways
are there to say heart attack? Cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction (and
related misspellings). How about using a keycode of “1” for heartrelated death, “2” for stroke, “3” for head trauma, etc.
 Pdfs: Remember that often pdf data can be extracted to Excel. Also,
extremely “clean” paper documents can be scanned, and the data
copied. Consider going to Kinko’s or some other copying service where
high-speed, excellent quality scanners are available. (All data copied
from scanned documents must be carefully proofed).
 A general rule: The more fields of data the better. Don’t put a full name
in a single field. Have a separate field for first name, another for last,
another for middle. Also separate city, state and ZIP Code. Some
database designers like to isolate the street number from the name.
 Don’t wait until the database is done to begin analysis. Do some trial
runs after a hundred or so records are entered. Invariably, you’ll decide
something needs to be tweaked. If you’re gathering from multiple
sources, such as several police departments, you’ll find that data is often
entered differently and in various quality levels.
 Also check the data entry early in the inputting stages. If many people
are entering data, check for spelling and consistency. Consider using
Validation rules, which restrict the way the data can be entered.
 Keep online web applications in mind when building a database. It
might be okay for analysis purposes to enter cryptic notes in the
“comments” field. But what if you later decide to post online. Keep the
data clean from the start.

Examples of stories and projects generated by hand-built databases.
Five years after the Station nightclub fire ultimately killed 100 people, the staff at
The Providence Journal in Rhode Island continues to make use of a database
built by Paul Parker.
Stories generated from the database:
1.The first public listing of who was inside the club at the time of the fire, which
also demonstrated the club was legally overcrowded.
2. Simulations of the evacuation of the nightclub, which showed reporters what
happened that night, as well as allowing them to examine alternative scenarios,
such as smaller crowd sizes or additional exits.
3. One datum for each person was how that person gained admittance to the
club. This showed that several dozen people were on the band's guest list and
that they died in disproportionate numbers. The newspaper did a story profiling
these people.
4. Another datum was the person's first-hand account of what happened to them
that night. These were woven together into a moment-by-moment narrative of
being inside the fire.
5. Several years after the fire, a judge accepted plea deals in criminal cases
stemming from the fire, despite prosecutors' objections. The judge said he did it
to spare victims the trauma of a trial. Providence Journal staffers tapped their
database to contact more than 100 survivors and victims' families to poll them on
whether they wanted to be spared the trauma.
The database also helped the newspaper avoid doing a non-story. Reporters
heard from fire experts that, in nightclub fires, men tend to represent twice as
many fatalities as women. This matched the Station fire, where two-thirds of the
dead were men. This conjured up images of men heroically rescuing women at
sacrifice of their own lives. But, the database showed that men made up twothirds of the crowd that night, so they died at exactly the same rate as women.
The story continues to unfold:

At The Palm Beach Post, William M. Hartnett digitally scanned thousands of
records from the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, which he used to
build a comprehensive database of professional football rosters. The result was
“Heavy Pressure,” a story about how NFL football players struggle to deal with
requirements that they maintain certain weights. Hartnett’s data showed the
number of NFL players weighing 300 pounds or more rose from 0 in 1976 to 570
in 2006.

Ken Dilanian at USA Today pulled together FEC data, land records, fundraiser
invitations and other information to build a database that shows a big loophole
home federal campaign financing laws. Despite all the new restrictions, a
lobbying or interest group can rent their building (and even a chef) to a politician
well below market rates and log it as a nominal contribution or even avoid
disclosure because of several exemptions. As a result, a growing number of
lobbyists and trade groups have bought up Capitol Hill townhouses to make it
easy for members of Congress to dash over for a quick and profitable evening
fundraiser.

Acting on a tip from a health commissioner, Tisha Thompson, now at WTTG-TV
Fox in New York, put together a database of school health inspection reports in
Baltimore City over a period of four years. “After the second year, the Health
Department started to make two copies of every report and would throw one in
the ‘Tisha box,’ “ Thompson said. “It became the only computerized record in the
state of ‘school health.’ “ After three years of embarrassment, the city reduced
critical health inspection violations by 80 percent.

Staffers at The New York Times built their own database for a story about life
after exoneration by Janet Roberts and Elizabeth Stanton. The Times
interviewed more than 140 DNA exonerees and compiled the information in a
database. That database informed the story and fed the multimedia presentation.

For a story about conflict of interest among Ohio Supreme Court justices, The
Times created a structured database of court opinions by parsing the free text of
the opinions (downloaded from Lexis). They also had reporters read hundreds of
court opinions in which campaign contributors were parties to the case. The
reporters coded whether the judges ruled in favor or against the contributor and
entered this information in a database, which became the basis of the story.

When at USA Today, Mary Jo Webster built an Access database that helped
staffers gather information on members of the exclusive, all-male Augusta
National Gulf Club. The newspaper obtained a copy of the long-secret
membership of the club, and assigned a team of researchers do a public records
check on each one. Webster’s database had a form front-end where researchers
could fill in the blanks. There were fields for name, DOB (or age if that's all they
could find), address, occupation, current or most recent employer, phone
numbers, etc. Then there were fields where they could paste the text of whatever
they found. “The main thing it did was to ensure the researchers all searched for
the same bits of information -- cause they had a blank form sitting in front of them
that they were instructed to fill out as best as possible,” Webster said.

For a series about teacher misconduct called Broken Trust, the Sarasota HeraldTribune built its own database of teacher misconduct cases.The newspaper
obtained hard copies of every case against teachers that had been pursued by
Florida administrative regulators over roughly five years. Reporters reviewed
those 3,000 cases, digging through the 30,000 pages of records and recording
the information in a database that has become Florida’s most comprehensive
source of information on teacher abuse cases. The newspaper digitized the
paper and built forms so entry could be done by multiple people without having to
type.
