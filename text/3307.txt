Quick Hit Science and Health Ideas
by Dawn Fallik I http://dfallik.googlepages.com/
Need something impressive and quick? Here are 10 ideas to tum around with impressive results. All of
them can be layered into deeper stories.
1. Patents - Search doctors and universities in the U.S. electronic search. There's a lot of pressure now for doctors to have
patents on their discoveries - and then comes the invariable conflict of interest. Don't forget the expired patents, either.

2. Medical Boards - Request the spreadsheet (or just the list if they'll give it to you) of doctors who've had their license
revoked or suspended. See if they're practicing in other states.
3. Ditto for State Boards of Nursing - Very few people check out the nurses. Ask for monthly disciplinary actions.
4. Adverse Event Databases - Is there a big drug recall? Are you writing about a lawsuit where a machine malfunctioned?
Is the story about someone who had a bad reaction to a medication? Here are some good resources:

National Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System: http://vaers.hhs.gov
FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System:

Medical Device Malfunctions: https://www.ecri.org

5. Follow the Money - Who is getting grants? Note that grants for the National Center for Complementary and Alternative
Medicine must be FOIA'd separately: http://nccam.nih.gov/

National Institutes of Health: http:/ / crisp.cit.nih.gov/
National Science Foundation: http://www.nsf.gov/funding/

6. Inspections - All health facilities must be inspected, whether it's an acupuncture center, a health clinic, or a hospital.
Many are inspected by several groups - the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations and the State
Board of Health to start with. Find out what's happening.
7. Restaurant, Horse Carriage, Zoo, and Nail Salon Inspections - The Philadelphia DailY News did a great series on animal
treatment violations concerning the carriage rides in Philadelphia that raised a lot of public awareness. If you're doing
restaurants, start with the question - how often are they supposed to be inspected? Some places that serve raw food, like
sushi, are supposed to be inspected more than others.
8. The New 990s - Non-profits have to ftle a new, expanded annual tax return for the 2008 tax year. The new fonns will
contain new info about employee and director compensation. Hospitals have a new 990H with infonnation on charity care
and community needs.

9. Financial Conflicts - Public universities with a medical or pharmacy school have to ftle annual conflict-of-interest
statements containing some detail about faculty fmancial holdings and private consulting, employment, and other outside
income. (Laws vary. Some may be pardy redacted.)

If your local medical school is private, good luck getting these fonns.

10. Certificate of Need - Many states have these boards that require a hospital to justify new construction, expansion, etc.
It's amazing what they sometimes will say in their proposals, e.g., we need new radiology equipment because current machine
is causing an unacceptably high number of retakes and thus exposing patients to needless risk of radiation.
