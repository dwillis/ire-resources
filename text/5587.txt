Records denied? Don’t give up!
What was the agency’s reason?
Do the records even exist?
Can you ask in a different way?
Think beyond what’s electronic.
Have a plan and pitch it!

Is the denial discretionary? Does another agency have the info?
Practice your accountability interview, role play, and prioritize questions.
Be respectful but make it clear that you will report difficulty in obtaining information.
