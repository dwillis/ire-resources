Turning an
investigation into
an explainer
A brief explainer on explainers.

Step one: research

Fully understand the
story.
Figure out what you can
show to help others
understand the story.
Find all the different types
of formats and angles a
story could take.

Step two: writing

I start with a visual outline.
Write a two-column script
with visuals on one side and
narration on the other. Fill
out both sides
simultaneously with all the
cool visuals found in
research.
Read it out loud.

Step three: production
[[ the part where I can do interviews or shoot
accompanying video elements for animation ]]

the fun part

First draft:
I lay down the narration, the music (if there is
music), and still images or basic drawings as
stand-ins for animation.
This draft is for comprehension.

Second draft:
Start animating! Using all the visuals in script and
outline as a guide.
Information > decoration.
Less is more. People can only pay attention to one
thing at a time so always guide their eyes.
Time everything to narration.
Minimize text.

Third draft:
Smooth out all the little visual things.
Tweak music and/or add sound effects.
Have someone who hasn’t ever seen a draft watch
the piece.

Tips on distribution...
Use the first 5 - 30 seconds to make a statement.
For Facebook: Big, animated text on screen in that first section can help.
For both YouTube and Facebook: Never underestimate the power of a good,
visual thumbnail.

Fact-checking your animation
- representations of people need to be accurate (best
case scenario: photos)
- Is the historical representation in the animation
accurate?
- Depictions of culture - does it look plausible?
→ To fact-check your visuals, find the most important
expert, who might find flaw with your images

Thank you!
