News happens fast and many
times we are chasing the
stories of the day or grinding
out the stories on our beats

 Many breaking stories or big ongoing stories

can be advanced with data.
 Businesses, governments, hospitals, law
enforcement, schools, and colleges are data
factories.
 Think of what can be added with some data:
perspective, numbers, trends, maps,
graphics, additional story ideas, the perfect
anecdote, the missing piece that nails your
story

 What else can be said? A lot
 Banks and how they helped sink the economy

is one of the biggest issue of the day. Banks
are one of the most regulated business in the
country (despite what happened before the
meltdown)
 Local records can sometimes shed as much

light as national ones

 Heard before the annual auction in Tucson

that many of the buyers of tax liens were
actually banks buying through LLCs and
trusts
 Requested a copy of the bidder list for the
pervious year
 Also requested a database of liens from Pima
County
 Went to the auction to find out for myself

 Determined who the banks where through

Delaware corporate trust records and SEC
records
 Put together the several years of auction
sales and linked the bidders to find the
largest purchasers
 Bought a database of foreclosures from real
estate data company
 Cleaned the data and found the foreclosures
from the same banks that were buying liens

 Then mapped the liens and foreclosures in

ArcGIS
 Mapped by census tract to show foreclosures
were in ring outside the city where housing
values fell most.
 Meanwhile tax liens against houses were in
center of the city where values fell less and
there was more collateral.

 Using the latitude longitude coordinates from

ArcGIS, we were able to create an online
interactive map
 Showed that banks were buying tax liens in
the same where they were foreclosing on
homeowners.
 Front page map and photos showed two
houses next to each other – a foreclosure and
a tax lien bought by JP Morgan.

Can be helpful for
crime stories, especially
when cops are not
 Database gives us
chance to do our own
stories, rather than rely
on police
 The potential for data
to add to reporting is
unlimited


Works for
breaking
news too

Real Estate Bust: Are
there any more
stories? Yes
 Used databases to find
there were a massive
number of houses sold
for under $100,000
 Crunched the
numbers, found they
were one third of all
sales in 2011
