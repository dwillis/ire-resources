the Biblical Times “it was

was up to Adam and Eve.

HOW WE TOLD THE STORY OF A YOUNG MAN WHO WAS MISSING FOR NINE YEARS…
AND HIS MOTHER’S JOURNEY TO FIND HIM

• Characters need to change on that journey
(even if you have to “recreate” that change)
üIf they are dead, bring them back alive
üIf they are angry, go back to when they were
happy
üIf they are beaten, go back to when they had
hope
üIf they did something bad, go back to when they
were good.

Why you should care

ü If they are dead, bring them back alive
ü If they angry, go back to when they were happy

you are bold enough to try some flourishes
(foreshadowing, flashbacks, reverse timeline)
