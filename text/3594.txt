¾Remember to check underlying demographics in
big news stories:
What’s the surrounding area like for the planned
landfill? Probably low income and maybe minority.
Pollution levels in areas analyzed by race & age.
School levy voting results: older areas support or
oppose?

American

households each year (1 in 65
households in America).
¾ It replaces the census “long form.”
