How to find them
National Pipeline Mapping System: ​https://www.npms.phmsa.dot.gov/
This site has a lot of limits. It shows the pipelines in only one county at a time. It shows only
lines regulated by PHMSA. Sometimes, you can find better maps simply by Googling the name
of the pipeline. More detailed information can be found in an EIS, if applicable.

How to find data about them
Say there's a big pipeline that explodes or spills near you, here's how to find out more about the
company that operates it (if it's regulated by PHMSA). Have there been other incidents in this
area? How many incidents in my state in the last year?
https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/distribution-transmission-gathering-lng-a
nd-liquid-accident-and-incident-data
This is a compilation of reports pipeline companies have submitted about incidents on their
lines. There are separate files for distribution, gas transmission, hazardous liquids and LNG.
The files have about 550 rows of data, including time, date, whether there was an explosion,
fatalities or injuries (most fields are empty, though). The narrative is at the end, and usually
omits a lot.
By company:
https://opsweb.phmsa.dot.gov/primis_pdm/pub_op_search.asp​ (Oracle DataMart site)
There's a lot of information in the tabs located here -- annual reports (detailed information on
pipeline mileage, material diameters, frequency of inspection etc.), Records of incidents,
enforcement and fines, notifications to PHMSA, NRC reports and federal inspections. (The
Oracle site often doesn't work with Chrome).
Enforcement actions against specific companies:

For a more comprehensive list of inspections or enforcement actions, you would need to file a
FOIA. To see all inspections, rather than just a company-by-company list of inspections, you'd
need to file a FOIA.
