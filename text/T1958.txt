Finding great stories in the Census

Places to start…

The U.S. Census Bureau website:
www.census.gov
The gateway to all of their data. Bookmark this site if you don’t have it already. If you
really want to be ahead of the curve, call the U.S. Census Bureau Public Information
Office at (301) 763-3030 and get on their media embargo list. The bureau releases the
best data ahead of time to reporters and editors under embargo. That gives you more time
to come up with a better story.

Census bureau’s population estimates division:
http://eire.census.gov/popest/estimates.php
Released yearly, the population estimates division tries to estimate the populations of
states, counties and cities over 10,000 people. Data is available in Excel spreadsheets.

Economic Census:
http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/econ97.html
Quiet right now, the Economic Census will become news in 2004, when the first data
from this every-five-years survey of local businesses is released.

American Community Survey
http://www.census.gov/acs/www/Products/index.htm
Limited to larger counties and cities, new ACS data was just released, updating some of
the data from the 2000 Census with newer numbers. However, this is survey data, and
there is a margin of error that can sometimes be quite wide. In 2004, however, the bureau
will expand the sample size from 700,000 to 3 million en route to replacing the long form
census with this rolling survey (think long form data every year!).
