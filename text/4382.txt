what are we
making?

look at your LED.
what do you notice?

always goes
to GROUND

always goes to
POWER or a PIN

put your LED and your
battery together.

getting to know
your new bestie:
arduino, a
microcontroller

the arduino
TA DAAAA!!

a pin provides an input or output
through which the controller can
communicate with components.

3 ground pins
3 power pins
// 5 volts
// 3 volts

let’s build!

hello world!

-/GRD

+/PIN 13

YOU CAN ONLY DO THIS ON PIN 13!

Try changing these numbers. What happens?

the *really* cool
thing about this:
we can make the
arduino sense

resistance is a
material’s tendency
to resist the flow of
charge(current).

a pin provides an input or output
through which the controller can
communicate with components.

14 Digital pins
(input or output)
6 Analog pins
(input only)

6 Analog Input pins
You can read a wide
range of values
Read

0 - 1023

6 Analog Input pins
You can read a wide
range of values
Read

0 - 1023

These allow you to turn
current into numbers!
You can use numbers in
your computer progam.

Remember how we played with these numbers?

“Serial Monitor”

Serial.begin(9600);

Serial.println(sensorValue);

Serial.println(sensorValue/4.3);

quick primer on
electricity
[don’t run away
just yet]

voltage is
the difference in
charge between two
points.

current is the rate
at which charge is
flowin.
