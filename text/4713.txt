Why local elections matter?
“In traditional local school board
elections, issues are about ‘what are
we going to do with the high school
football stadium,’ or candidates position
themselves because they’re a
successful businessman. But what we
think we see is a growing recognition
by national level education reformers
that they need to fight battles at the
local level. The need to establish proof
points for their broader reforms.”
— Jeff Henig, Columbia University
