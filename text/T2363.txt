Let’s face facts. It’s really, really easy to lose it doing computer-assisted
reporting. The learning curve is steep, the potential for error is high, and
colleagues get fidgety every time they hear the words “Cartesian join.” Here are
some rules for keeping it together. I’ve tried to follow them all.
I.

Keep it simple.
Master the basics. Never try to learn something complicated on deadline.

II.

Make time to learn.
Set aside a few hours every week to learn something new. Take classes.
Experiment with software. If you must, read the manual.

III.

Promote yourself.
Look for chances to contribute your expertise to breaking news stories.

IV.

Build a data library.
Find out what databases your local government keeps, and ask for them.
Go window-shopping at IRE/NICAR’s Database Library.

V.

Document your work.
Write down everything you might need to remember in six months.

VI.

Join a support group.
CAR is lonely work. The NICAR-L listserv is a great place to get help.

VII.

Don’t let others use you.
There’s a fine line between mentoring and serving. Always, always,
always ask that your work be credited.

VIII.

Find a rabbi.
Recruit an expert at a local university who can critique your work.

IX.

Don’t forget to have fun.
Write a computer-assisted fluffy feature. Or two or three.

X.

Never forget that you are a reporter first and a CAR jock second.
The numbers are not the story. The numbers may point to the story. Or
they may not. It takes a good reporter to tell the difference.
