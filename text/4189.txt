Finding Great Ideas






Pay attention to your beat reporters. Some of the best stories are born when a journalist
sees something in their daily paper or evening broadcast and says: Well, that seems crazy -I wonder how often that happens? Maybe it’s a cop who was fired at one agency for
misconduct but shows up at another agency a few years later. Or someone on the business
desk writing about a string of foreclosures and judgments by the same holding company. Or
a big rig crashes on the interstate because of faulty equipment.
Create habits. If you’re interested in business, make sure you’re checking local SEC filings or
bankruptcies in PACER on a regular basis. If you’re covering cops, don’t just ask for the daily
arrests – rifle through search warrant affidavits or make a monthly request for their mobile
data terminal (MDT) logs. If you’re watching City Hall, get everyone’s emails and texts.
Read. A lot. Imitation is the best form of flattery and some of the best ideas come from
what your colleagues have done elsewhere. That doesn’t mean you’re ripping them off –
but just about every paper in America can emulate the fantastic code enforcement series

done by The Columbus Dispatch or the project on assisted-living facilities by the Miami
Herald in 2011.
Identifying and Obtaining Data







Read the law. And not just the ones that correspond to public records. Check out the
statutes, regulations or codes that pertain to your investigation. Chances are, there is
something in there that gives you a clue.
Fight back. Remember that you’re dealing on the front end with a flack, someone who
doesn’t know the law or the basics of data. Try to show them examples from other sources.
Offer to meet with their IT department – you’re speaking the same language as them.
Look for the regulators. Figure out who’s responsible for the oversight and unwind your
FOIAs from there. Figure out what kind of data the regulators are seeking and follow their
lead. Keep an eye out for Inspectors General, the GAO, state/local authorities.
Always check the basics: Nexis, academic works, government studies, Google (especially
site-specific searches).
Use IRE! Some of what you need may be in the NICAR library or buried in a tipsheet you
didn’t know you needed to read.
The Drafting/Editing Process






Settle your themes – and stick to them. What is your story about? Don’t stray too far afield
from your hypotheses. Your findings, your anecdotes, your sources are all in place to
reinforce this.
Outline like mad. Yes, it’s cliché. But it works. Are you telling this story chronologically?
Does one finding logically lead to another? Keep readers on the Yellow Brick Road so they
don’t get bored and don’t wander away from your copy.
Be clear and concise. Use declarative sentences. Write in the active voice. Kill “-ly” adverbs.
Avoid like the plague words that serve as a crutch: many, most, often, usually, quickly. Be
precise.
Don’t forget about people. Sure, data is important. But data doesn’t actually do anything –
people do things. They build bridges (or forget to fix them), they defraud the elderly, abuse
the disabled, persecute watchdogs and any number of other things. Let the data guide you
toward human beings, which are the most important characters in any story.

 From Rob O’Dell
Starting out





Lay out a schedule for both data and reporting
Keep the focus narrow at onset (it always grows anyway)
Budget 30 percent more time than you think it will take in reporting, analysis and
interactives.







Think about online display and interactives at the beginning not the end.
Consider assigning one copy editor to oversee the project and data so they are familiar with
the data and can be the point person on the project.
Identify the records needed, how you will get them (if you don’t have them already) and
what it will take to get them. Sometimes getting the data into a format to analyze it can be
the longest part.
Create a timeline for both the reporting and analysis and try to stick to it.

Data analysis





Do an early analysis on the data to determine the path to take.
Understand that there will be more data and reporting needed as you go along and you will
have to adjust as you go.
Take stock of your competitive situation and use it to inform your plans.
Overestimate the time you think the analysis will take and don’t waiver off that estimate
until you are finished with the data analysis.
Once you are farther into the data, run the analysis like it was a (near) final analysis for
publication.
Run a third (or fourth or fifth) final analysis a few weeks before publication. Try to anticipate
what the other side would say about your data and analyze it in that light. Try to poke holes
in everything you assume about the data.
Identify choke points in the reporting and data process. If for example, you can’t report
without your data analysis, do that first.
Think about the best allocation of resources. Some times this will me splitting up the work
so two things can be worked on at once. Other times large tasks will require the heavy
lifting of everyone on the team. It’s all about allocating resources.
Start writing something as soon as your story is beginning to take shape. You don’t want to
take six months to report and two days to write.
Let the data inform the reporting and vice versa. The two shouldn’t be in silos but should
help drive the other. For example, data can tell you where to go for shoe leather and
reporting can unearth gems in the data.
You want to be the one taking the hardest and harshest look at your data.
Take the most conservative projection that tells the story. Don’t worry about fighting over
the 10 % on the fringe.
Think about how your most unreasonable critics would react and use that mindset
Think about every possible limitation of your data.

The final gauntlet




Not making errors is a mindset. Create a robust fact checking process and will yourself not
to make errors.
Think about every possible limitation of your data while you fact check.








Take a day a week of publication just to spend with your data.
Take a day to stress test data in final week
Print out copies to check all facts, names, titles and numbers in the story.
A myriad of people are going to touch the piece. Make sure that you edit and fact check the
last version of the story and not the second or third last.
Fact check the data just as much or more than the reporting.
Make sure to fact check the interactives thoroughly as well. Be as obsessive with the data
and the interactive fact checking as you are with reporting. Many of the errors in big
projects can come in the databases or interactives because they have not been vetted
enough.

The basics












Assign the story:
Time peg?
Build the team: Story editor + reporter + lead producer
If bigger scope, + more researchers or reporters?
Will the data need to be fact-checked? Copy edited?
If there's video/audio or rich media content, video producer?
Tips for small newsrooms
Everyone's a data reporter.
Ask these questions early: What’s the story? Source, age,
reliability, time scope? Do we need to talk to an expert?
No data hand-offs.
Google Drive and Spreadsheets are our friends.
Empowering the newsroom with Skillz trainings.

Organize the reporting







Make a game plan:
Who's collecting what data?
Who's calling for comment?
Who's drafting the text? Who's writing what?
Who will keep the ball rolling? Assign a lead producer.
Don't fall into the traps of an evergreen timeline. Set
benchmark goals.

Vizualize the data
Interrogate the project:
 What’s the story we’re trying to tell here?
 Do we care about shareability?
 Is this story best told through a static or interactive
presentation?
 Is this a project we’ll want to open-source?
 Open-sourcing opens doors for others to help make your
process/product better.





Build the prototype
Design concepts and wireframing only take you so far.
Code or build the prototype as soon as possible.
If it works, polish, tweak, and user test until ready to publish.
If not, back to the drawing board.






No sleep till fact-checked
Source all your data.
Don't let fact-checking be an afterthought.
Expect fact-check errors and build in time to address them.
Don’t have a fact-checker? Try a colleague.

Reducing legal risk







Do not wait to “confront” the subjects of your story until end. Let them know what you are
working on early and make every effort to get them to participate. Keep making every effort
even if they are not receptive.
Consider a summary of what you are learning as an “FYI” even to subjects who won’t be
interviewed. Tell them you don’t need to quote them, but you do need to know if any facts
are wrong.
Consider registered letters or emails to verify data. “This comes from government database
so if it is wrong, we need to hear from you by XXX.”
Consider read-backs of key portions of your story to key sources. Develop a standard for
doing read-backs in your newsroom.
Reducing data risk













Enlist a Sherpa in the agency that is the source of the data. Ask them about caveats and
potholes in the data. Tell them how you plan to analyze.
Enlist an academic. Having an expert in the field review your analysis and citing them in the
story can boost your credibility.
Enlist your readers. Post the data and analysis and ask for feedback.
Think about how your harshest critic would attack the analysis. Is there any way to address
the concerns they would bring to the table?
Framing the story
Be rigorous about the frame. If the thesis is a table top, does every leg support the table? Is
every leg essential? Completely nailed?
Does your frame engage the most readers? Give the story the widest scope?
An investigative story should be an argument. A well-supported one, but not a question, a
case to be made.
Embrace the gray. It’s a stronger and more sophisticated story if it reflects the real world.
There are no clear-cut white hats and black hats.
That said, you need some partial black hats. If readers cannot see a failure of specific people
or systems, the story will just be mush.
Tell readers what you don’t know. If you leave it out without saying why, they will think you
didn’t realize it’s important.

Managing up and keeping on track






Be careful about sharing analysis too early. Outliers look like news. They are often
errors.
Still, don’t hoard information. Build excitement for your story by sharing interview
highlights, key conferment nuggets.
Use a backout schedule. If the schedule slips, so should the publication date.
Build in some go/no go deadlines. They should be early enough you can actually pull the
plug or delay the story. Practically, there becomes a point of no return with every story.
Share a “lessons learned” memo as high as possible after. Your readers demand
constant improvement. Show your editors you are fulfilling that.
