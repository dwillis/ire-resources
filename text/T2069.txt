Alan & Neil’s Most Excellent Top Tips
SEARCH ENGINES ARE EVIL
•
•

A search engine is like a “Hail Mary” pass. If you get lucky, you score a touchdown; if not, the
ball just sails away.
What do Yogi Berra, Niels Bohr, Samuel Goldwyn, Dan Quayle and Mark Twain have in
common? According to Google, they said: “Prediction is difficult, especially about the future.”

SEARCH ENGINES ARE THE GREATEST THING SINCE SLICED BREAD
•
•
•
•

If you’re really jammed up, they can bail you out.
But you have to know how to use them.
Learn to use one really, really well. But know about others, too.
If you really know how to use them, you can find most anything quickly

IT’S BETTER TO KNOW WHERE YOU’RE GOING
•
•

Learning to research is a lot like learning to drive. You start by driving around the block and you
practice a lot before you hit the Interstate.
In both cases, it’s a matter of practice.

TREAT THE `NET LIKE YOUR BEAT.
• When you get assigned to a new beat, the first thing you do is make the rounds. You talk to your
predecessor, check clips and “round up the usual suspects” as you get up to speed on sources and
issues. Do the same online.
• Spend as much time as you can on a few “hub” or “guru” sites that you are certain to use when the
pressure hits. Look for the best sites on a subject, locate the targeted directories and focused
crawlers that will point you directly to the guru or hub sites that are usually up-to-date, and loaded
with valuable material on specific subjects
• Examples: A business reporter must know how to use the Securities and Exchange Commission
Edgar Database www.sec.gov/edgar to background businesses. But the SEC site takes time to
learn and understand how to maneuver around. Likewise, police reporters should know their way
about www.fbi.gov, www.usdoj.gov and www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs, the Bureau of Justice Statistics

HAVE “READY REFERENCE” TOOLS AT YOUR ONLINE FINGERTIPS
•
•
•

But consider whether it’s worth it and whether you’ll get what you need
Learn when not to search. Sometimes it’s easier to reach for a dictionary or a telephone book; a
well-thumbed Almanac is a treasure-trove of useful information; the U.S. Statistical Abstract is
easier to browse in hard copy than online.
Memorize the URLs for a bunch of good reference sites – dictionaries, almanacs, encyclopedias –
and know how to use them.

BUILD ON OTHERS’ EXPERIENCES
•
•

People follow their passions – police work, business, public health, music, whatever. The result is
a growing archive of information –some good, some mediocre, some just plain wrong on any topic
that people get excited about.
Usenet groups like Google Groups, groups.google.com, and Yahoo Groups, groups.yahoo.com,
and lists of listservs like topica.net can help you find places where likeminded folks gather whom
you can use as sources.

DON’T FORGET PAPER.
•
•

Going online both enhances and restricts serendipity. You’ll find places you didn’t know existed.
But you can’t thumb through a bunch of sites the way you can a file drawer or book of documents.
When you walk into a courthouse you talk to people.
Often, especially on government or judicial sites, what’s online is an abstract or docket. You need
the full document.

DEADLINE ORGANIZING – BUILD A CHECKLIST
• Organize yourself first!
Build checklists of the kinds of information for which you’re searching: (articles, stats, company
websites, white papers.
• Use the web to identify ambiguities, pin down exact words, phrases and parameters to do your feebased search. Search for low-hanging fruit
• Use fee-based online services to find high-value material.
• If you are up against the deadline NOW, just go to the fee-based tool –but make sure you know
how to use it surgically and strategically.

SEARCHING A SUBJECT WHEN YOU HAVEN’T A CLUE
•
•

Got a project on a subject with which you’re entirely unfamiliar?
Pre-web, you would have called a librarian for help. You still can! That’s what librarians do;
makes friends with a good one.
Check sites like Glossarist http://www.glossarist.com/ a browsable and searchable directory of
web-based glossaries and subject-specific dictionaries.

GOT A LIBRARY CARD?
•
•
•

Get one.
Free advice and fee-based resources for nothing.
Nuff said.

NEW TRICKS ON GOOGLE
• Info operator
Brings up up additional information that can be really useful.
Type info:deadlineonline.com it will bring up the website, a cached copy of the site, similar and
related pages, pages that link to the site and also pages that mention the site.
• Webquotes
Find out what others are saying about a site. http://labs.google.com/cgi-bin/webquotes
• Site or Domain searches
Google will search specific sites or domains. Type atlanta site:census.gov to find everything that
the Census has on Atlanta. Type Atlanta domain:.gov to restrict your search to government sites.
• define:searchterm
Google will return definitions of the word or phrase from web-based glossaries
Remember to click through from the definitions that Google provides on the search results page to
the originating web site, which will be a dictionary or glossary or other terms within that topic or
industry.

OTHER SEARCH ENGINES ARE IMPORTANT, TOO
•

Know the difference between subject engines and search engines. One is created and organized by
humans; the other by software.
• Use subject directories if you’re not sure what you want but will recognize is when you see it or as
a way to find key words to plug into search engines.
• Learn to use one search engine well. But if you don’t find what you need quickly, try others.
There’s not as much overlap between them as you might think. (Dubious? Check out
http://ranking.thumbshots.com)

VALIDATE EVERYTHING
•
•
•

If your mother says she loves you, check it out…especially if it’s on a web site.
Trust no dates unless they’re in news stories or indicate the date of a posting in a Google Group or
on a listserv.
The unknown factor is what is a date on the Internet –it can be when it was created, when it was
published, the date it was first indexed by a search engine crawler, the date it was re-indexed by
the search engine, a revision date, an expiration date, a crawling date, an indexing date.

ALAN & NEIL’S MOST EXCELLENT SITES
SEARCH ENGINES/SUBJECT DIRECTORIES YOU SHOULD KNOW
•

Teoma www.teoma.com
has a unique capability to identify “hubs” and “authorities” sites that publish “link collections
from experts and enthusiasts.” While these resources are not often invisible web resources in
themselves, they often point the way to them. And since Teoma “discovers” these expert link
pages for each query you run (rather than using pre-computed relevance scores) you’ll find that
they serve as a great “mining” tool for finding incredibly useful guru sites. You run a search on
Teoma and in the bottom right corner of the page, you will see the resources links.

•

A9 www.a9.com
Combines Amazon and Google. It offers a powerful search engine and many of the “inside-thebook” features of amazon.com. Like the other toolbars, your searches are tracked. But Amazon
has also set up a site that won’t track your searches. http://generic.a9.com

•

VIVISIMO www.vivisimo.com
Innovative clustering technology, helps you sub-divide searches into categories. It also has some
topic-focused clusters on topics like medicine (uses pubmed) http://vivisimo.com/clustermed Will
also let you cluster from Ebay, Firstgov, and Scirus (science)

•

HOTBOT www.hotbot.com
This is not the old hotbot tool –its now a meta-search tool but is very useful because it lets you
quickly compare results from three of the deepest databases on the web –Google, Ask
Jeeves/Teoma and its own Inktomi engine. Think of it as a quick three-in-one tool.

•

KARTOO www.kartoo.com
For those who think visually instead of in lists, this is a great search tool. It maps the search
results by linking the keywords in a visual representation of your results.

•

Surfwax www.surfwax.com
Surfwax’s advanced search tool has some really useful time-saving features, including “my search
sets,” customized collections of sites from thousands of sites. Use it to build resources on subjects
you don’t know.

THE TOOLBAR DILEMMA
Hundreds of toolbars, no space left to look for anything on your browser.
Best solution: Groowe.com. The toolbar equivalent of speed-dating, with access to 17 toolbars in one and
all the advanced tools they provide.
Privacy warning –using many of these toolbars sends information about exactly what you are searching
for to the search engine. But you can also use that to your advantage –check out the
www.google.com/press/zeitgeist for an example.
Groowe.com doesn’t block popups, though. Google, Alexa and Yahoo toolbars do and you should install
one.
