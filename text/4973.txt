Doctors & Sex Abuse

There was no data

There was too much data

Enter Jeff: “Let’s get the
computer to do the
reading.”

100,000 became 10,000

So many shocking casees
Rapes by OB/GYNs, seductions by psychiatrists, fondling by
anesthesiologists and ophthalmologists, and molestations by
pediatricians and radiologists.
Victims were babies. Adolescents. Women in their 80s. Drug
addicts and jail inmates. Survivors of childhood sexual
abuse.
Again and again, reporters were shocked to learn that these
doctors were allowed to continue to practice, sometimes with
only a slap on the wrist.
(Ultimately determined half still practicing.)

“Not a numbers story”

Relentless organization
Violated while unconscious

Outrageous statements by regulators

Hospitals that didn’t report
Multiple victims

Not reported to police

Excuses doctors gave

Digitization

Digitization

Finding victims

Visually challenged
