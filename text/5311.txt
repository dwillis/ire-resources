Cultivating the Watchdog in your
newsroom
Investigative Reporters and Editors
Louisville regional workshop

Oct. 22, 2017

Why watchdog?

We do it because ...
It bolsters our credibility in a time when we need to
prove our value to readers
●

●

It makes us better storytellers

It inclines the people, businesses and agencies we
report on to take us seriously
●

How do we do it?

Make it structured
Make it streamlined
Make it intuitive
Make it reflexive

Some suggestions
Build watchdog components into the newsroom
structure you already have – make it part of the daily
budget meeting and the weekly long-term enterprise
planning session
●

Create a watchdog checklist that includes
backgrounding for people and go-to list of links for
businesses, agencies and nonprofits
●

Set up and maintain your watchdog inventory of
resources in a commonly accessible location, such as a
Google Drive account
●

Enlist help
Don't pretend the newsroom can do it alone. Develop
independent experts, in and out of journalism, you can consult
when in doubt:
●

–Accountants
–Lawyers
–Scientists

Reach out to journalism resources before you need them on
deadline and establish relationships — these could include
those helpful IRE experts, people from Harvard Shorestein,
SPJ, Pro Publica and the Center for Public Integrity
●

Answering the 'who'
Not everyone in you newsroom will embrace the sort
of work and methodology required
●

●

Find a champion for watchdog work

Give your staff time to interact and exchange ideas
and discoveries
●

Document your successes — you need to check your
progress occasionally and this will take some of the
guesswork out of the assessment. Have your champion
set up a timeline in your Google Drive account, and
make it everyone's task to keep it up to date.
●

Make it easy ...
List all the local governments you ordinarily deal with, and the
name and contact information for the person who is the
custodian of public records for each. Get to know that person.
Become familiar with the records retention policy so you know
what they've got.
●

Make regular, relatively simple FOIA requests to get the
agency accustomed to fulfilling them without being onerous.
●

Introduce your news organization to the state attorney general
office and personnel responsible for making decisions on open
record appeals.
