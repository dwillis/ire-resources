Google Drive
http://drive.google.com
Price: Free
An inexpensive alternative to Microsoft Office hosted in the cloud, Google Drive offers its own
versions of Word, Excel, Powerpoint and more with much of the same functionality. Can also be
embedded to share with readers.

Cometdocs
http://cometdocs.com
Price: Free
This free, Web-based file converter is useful for transforming PDFs into more useful formats, like
text or Excel tables. IRE members can get a free subscription to Cometdocs Premium, which
expands its limits on document sizes and includes optical character recognition for scanned PDFs.

DocumentCloud
http://documentcloud.org
Price: Free
This Web-based application offers a suite of tools to organize, annotate and analyze documents as
well as share them with both colleagues and audiences. Every document uploaded to
DocumentCloud is automatically processed with optical character recognition, allowing for
accurate searches, as well as entity extraction to pull out and track things like names and dates.
To get a free DocumentCloud account, you must be a working journalist.

Fusion Tables
http://tables.googlelabs.com
Price: Free
A beta project from Google, Fusion Tables allows users to mash up their data with other existing
tables, like maps of political boundaries or poverty levels, using simple joins. Users can map the
results and embed them in their websites quickly and easily.

Timeflow
http://reporterslab.org/timeflow
Price: Free
Timeflow is a visual tool for reporters looking to organize and analyze historical data on longterm stories. The downloadable java app makes it easier for reporters to tell in-depth narratives
by tracking trends and making sense of temporal data.

Overview
https://www.overviewproject.org/
Price: Free
This Web-based application automatically sorts thousands of documents into topics and subtopics by reading the full text of each one. Its interface also links with DocumentCloud, allowing
reporters to easily import, tag and scan these large document sets.

Open Refine
http://openrefine.org/
Price: Free
OpenRefine (formally Google Refine), allows rapid cleaning of data with the combination of Excellike formulas and text faceting/clustering. The downloadable application, which runs in a Web
browser, groups similar words together based on multiple algorithms and allows users to quickly
standardize names, businesses and other data.

mySQL
http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/5.6.html

Navicat
http://www.navicat.com/
Price: $100
Navicat’s $100 price tag can be worth it if you’re looking to deal commonly with mySQL. It
provides a user-friendly front end for the database service and reduces your need for knowledge
of SQL language. A free trial is available.

Muse
