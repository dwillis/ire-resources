How to track flights and get emails as soon as a specific plane takes off:

Ziva Branstetter, Projects Editor, Tulsa World:
This is probably not new to those who have covered aviation, but it was new to me. You can
track the comings and goings of someone's private plane through http://flightaware.com/. It
has a feature called flight tracker and if you register with the site, it will send you an email
every time a flight plan is filed for that plane. All you need is the N-number. Added by another
reporter:
FlightAware is a great site for tracking and it goes beyond just monitoring specific tail numbers.
It will tell you who owns the plane and is flight history. It will let you monitor specific airports,
and you don't even know the FAA codes. The limitations are: the site tracks only filed
instrument flight plans and while military flights file IFR plans, the site doesn't track them. It will
track NASA however. And, to be clear, VFR, even with flight following isn't tracked. Finally,
there is about a 6-minute lag on the information on the site.
(do this for all the state planes and for the TVA planes?)
(added by Paul Overberg
Any aircraft that's not flying commercial service can have its ID blocked through a registry run for
the FAA by the National Business Aircraft Association. Most major corporations participate
(including my employer). So if you know XYZ Corp. keeps a Falcon 300 at Podunk Airport, you'll
have to track all Falcon 300s there and then sift with other means. Depending on plane type and
airport size, it can be easy or needle in a haystack.
http://web.nbaa.org/public/ops/asdi/
Enjoy it while you can. The more popular services like FlightAware get, the more NBAA members
join the registry and look for even tighter security: "In 2005 NBAA participated in a thorough
review ...with the FAA. NBAA Member flight departments expressed increasing concerns
about the protection of their passengers’ privacy and security as well as the protection of
company proprietary information. This increased concern resulted from a proliferation of
ASDI vendors and vast improvements in technology since the late 1990’s that made it much
easier for the casual citizen to obtain flight information about aircraft that were on the
[blocked] list via legal workarounds. A primary result of this review was the addition of new
option for blocking ... at the FAA data source ... . Other changes are anticipated in the
future."

It's also fun to check out the airport in a university town on a game weekend to see what big
names come and go.
