Garey Higdon, the head of River City Properties, lives in a million
dollar home and drives a Rolls Royce. His tenants live in $400 a month
apartments plagued by mold, broken water pipes, busted air
conditioners, exposed wiring, rotting porches and cockroaches.
Using databases and public records, R.G. Dunlop of The Courier-Journal
found that during a five-year period, about one-fourth of all housing
complaints in Jefferson County, Kentucky, came from tenants of Higdon’s
17 apartment complexes.
You can read his series online at http://www.courierjournal.com/cjextra/rentingtrouble/
Here’s an outline of how the CJ did the stories:
1. Inventoried the properties Higdon owned through public records
• Property tax records
• Deeds and mortgages
• Lawsuits in state court
• Housing hearings
• Inspection records
• Property appraisals
• Tax appeals
• Secretary of State corporate records
2. Built a database to track information about him and his company
• Property locations
• Assessments
• Criminal cases
• Civil lawsuits
• Tenants
• Inspections
• Managers
• Partners
3. Interviewed sources
• Partners
• Tenants
• Advocacy groups
• Housing experts
• Friends
• Lawyers
4. Obtained and analyzed code enforcement databases
• The databases were obtained from the Louisville Bureau of
Inspections, Permits and Licensing and the Jefferson County
Health Department

The Health Department database required considerable cleaning,
including weeding out and fixing misspellings, duplicates and
other bad entries
The most significant problem was matching complaints to
properties. Many of the apartment complexes sprawled across many
streets, while ownership information generally just included the
main address.
o To get a complete list of addresses for each complex, R.G.
Dunlop spent a week visiting each complex, getting a
complete list of addresses by writing down numbers from
mailboxes, the sides of buildings, etc.
We queried the complaint databases for just those complaints on
streets where Higdon owned properties. We then went through the
database by hand to match complaints to actually properties, to
insure that we didn’t miss any complexes, and to insure that we
didn’t match any by mistake. This would have been difficult if
not impossible to do by using queries alone.

4. Hired a retired housing inspector to look at properties
• To get an independent appraisal at the current condition of his
properties
5. Mapped complaints and property locations
• Became a graphic in the series

Here are some things to consider should you embark on a similar
project:
1. Know what information you’re seeking
• Ask for a record layout or database schema describing what’s
there
• See the database in action, either by sitting down at a public
terminal, or by asking someone familiar with the database to
demonstrate to you how it works
• Examine official forms used to gather information, so you know
what is being entered
• Ask for standard reports produced from the database
2.
•

Know the records law
In Kentucky, agencies are required to provide electronic records
in their native format or in text “ASCII” format

3. Be willing to compromise
• Sometimes a protracted fight isn’t in your interests, even if you
may ultimately prevail. Your goal is to get the information you
need to do your story.
• In our case, we agreed to pay $600 for some programming to obtain
the information we wanted from the city of Louisville’s mainframe
housing complaint database. The city originally claimed it would
cost $100,000.
4. Mainframes aren’t PCs
• It can be difficult to get information out of old mainframe
computer systems in a format you can use on your PC. Officials

•

aren’t always lying if they say it won’t be easy to give you what
you want.
You do have lots of options to get what you want
o Ask if they can print reports to files instead of paper.
You can then convert the information into a form you can
use with Access or another program using tools like
Monarch, Perl or a text editor.
o Hire NICAR to convert the mainframe computer tapes into a
form you can use
o Hire a private data extraction firm that specializes in
converting database from “legacy” computer systems

5. Decide what’s important
• The databases we used included complaints about both interior and
exterior housing code violations
• We chose to concentrate on the interior violations, reasoning
those were most directly the responsibility of the landlord.
Exterior complaints typically involved such things as overgrown
grass, trash or vermin, which may or may not have been the
landlord’s responsibility.
6. Never trust the data
• Errors are a fact of life in any database. Your job is to weed
them out
o Perform queries to look for duplicates, multiple spellings
of the same name, dates that don’t make sense
• Go back to the creators of the database again and again until you
understand how the system works – both how it was intended to
work, and how it works in practice
o Ask what the database doesn’t include
o Ask how information gets in the database
o Ask if there are any quality checks to insure the
information is accurate
• Eyeball every record if you can.
o Summary queries can hide inconsistent or bad data.
Sometimes the best quality check isn’t automatic, but
manual
• Be conservative
o When in doubt, throw it out
7. Anticipate objections
• For every explanation there’s a counter explanation. What
evidence is there one way or the other?
o Never, ever choose only the evidence that supports
hypothesis. Let the facts determine the stories.
