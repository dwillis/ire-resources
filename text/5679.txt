The Never-Ending Chase for Stadium Subsidies
“We had to do a few things to put
pressure on the city and the state, but
our goal was to remain here in Pittsburgh
all the way. Those trips to Kansas City
and Vegas and other cities was just to
go, and have a nice dinner and come
back.“
Mario Lemieux, 2008
