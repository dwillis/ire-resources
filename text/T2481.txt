SOFT MONEY – This term used to refer mainly to unlimited contributions from corporations, labor
unions and wealthy individuals to the national political parties. Since the passage of McCain-Feingold,
which banned the national political parties from raising or spending soft money, the term now refers to
money raised to influence federal elections by 527 groups, 501(c) organizations, party nominating
conventions and presidential inaugural committees, among others.
527 Groups: Defined as organizations created under Internal Revenue Code Section 527, which applies
to “political organizations.”
Did you know?… Candidate committees, political parties and PACs are registered under Section
527, but we don’t refer to them as 527 groups. “527 group” is a term reserved for nonprofit advocacy
groups registered under Section 527, or groups that conduct at least some of their activities through a
527 account.

Limits and Prohibitions: 527 groups and others that raise and spend soft money are not currently
subject to the limits and prohibitions that apply to hard money. So they can raise unlimited amounts
from virtually any source, including corporations and labor unions. (They cannot raise funds directly
from foreign nationals or foreign companies, but they can collect money from U.S. subsidiaries of
foreign companies.)
Reporting Requirements: Since August 2000, 527 groups have had to disclose contributions of
more than $200 and expenditures of more than $500 to the Internal Revenue Service. (Congress
decided NOT to require disclosure to the Federal Election Commission.) Groups already filing at the
state level need not file with the IRS.
Reporting Schedule: Monthly for the entire two-year election cycle, or quarterly during election
years and semi-annually during off years
IRS: View images of 527 reports by visiting the IRS Web site (http://www.irs.gov/) and following
the steps below.

On the Horizon … More Regulation, Or Less?

527 Reform Act of 2005
Chief Sponsors: Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Russ Feingold (D-Wis.)
• Would require many 527 groups to register with the Federal Election Commission and
adhere to federal contribution limits (hard money). Groups focused solely on state or
local elections or ballot initiatives would not have to register with the FEC.
• Would mandate that activities affecting both federal and non-federal elections, such as
voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives, be paid for with at least 50 percent hard
money.
• Note: This bill has changed dramatically since it was proposed and its status is
uncertain.
527 Fairness Act of 2005
Chief Sponsors: Reps. Mike Pence (R-Ind.) and Al Wynn (D-Md.)
• Would repeal aggregate limits on individual contributions to federal candidates (currently
$40,000 per cycle) and to parties and PACs (currently $61,400 per cycle).
• Would repeal spending limits for the national political parties.
• Would allow nonprofits, trade associations and labor unions to use unlimited
contributions from individuals to pay for “electioneering communications” – broadcast
ads that mention a federal candidate just before an election.
501(c) Organizations: Groups registered under Tax Code section 501(c)(4) (social welfare), 501(c)(5)
(labor) or 501(c)(6) (business leagues, chambers of commerce) may devote up to half of their
expenditures to political activities such as lobbying and issue advocacy campaigns.
“Issue” Ads: Like 527 groups, 501(c) organizations can run print and broadcast ads that center on an
issue but also seek to influence people’s votes prior to an election.
As long as the ads avoid “express advocacy” (e.g. “vote for,” “vote against,” “elect,” “defeat”),
they can be paid for with soft money.
BUT, the McCain-Feingold law prohibits corporations and labor unions from paying for any
broadcast ad that mentions a federal candidate and airs immediately prior to an election.
Disclosure: 501(c) organizations do NOT have to disclose contributions or expenditures.
However, the 990 tax forms for tax-exempt, nonprofit organizations are available on Guidestar at
http://www.guidestar.org (free registration required).
Guidestar’s arrival in many ways superceded the widely used California AG’s Registry of
Charitable Trusts site at http://caag.state.ca.us/charities/. It is still good at some of the harder-tofind stuff.
The Foundation Center (http://www.fdncenter.org) has tax returns and financial info on
charities/trusts. Click on Foundation Finder (http://lnp.fdncenter.org/finder.html), which has
details and tax returns on 70,000 private and community foundations, or on the 990 search engine
(http://lnp.fdncenter.org/finder_990.html).

LOBBYING – The Lobbying Disclosure Act requires registered lobbyists and their clients to file reports
with Congress. The reports show how much the client paid (or the lobbyist billed) for lobbying activities

4 of 7

in the previous six months, the chamber(s) of Congress and/or federal agencies contacted and the issues
or bills lobbied on.
What’s Lobbying? In brief, lobbying is any oral, written or electronic communication to a covered
official that is made on behalf of a client, and any efforts in support of such communications. For a more
complete description, visit http://clerk.house.gov/pd/guideAct.html
Note: The definition of lobbying does NOT include grassroots activity or issue advocacy aimed at
the public.
Disclosure: The Secretary of the Senate’s Office of Public Records makes images of lobbying reports
available online at the following address – http://sopr.senate.gov/
Tips: Lobbyists and lobbying firms file separate reports for each of their clients. So if you want the
total amount spent on lobbying by a particular organization, you may have to add the totals reported
by each of its lobbying firms …
… UNLESS the organization has filed its own report. In that case, the organization is reporting its
internal lobbying activity AND the amount paid to outside lobbyists and firms. In other words, there’s
no need to add up the totals from different reports.
Other Sources of Lobbying Info:
The Department of Justice’s Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) Web site has information on
lobbyists and other agents of a foreign entity, who are required by law to register with the
government. Those required to register include foreign governments, foreign political parties, a
person or organization outside the United States (except U.S. citizens) and any entity organized under
the laws of a foreign country or having its principal place of business in a foreign country.
http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/fara/
Companies and nonprofits have taken this data and analyzed it many different ways. The Center for
Public Integrity has an online database that includes the names of all registered lobbyists, top clients
of all the lobbyists, issues and agencies lobbied.
http://www.publicintegrity.org/lobby/
One of the oldest companies to track federal lobbying is Columbia Books, which publishes
Washington Representatives, the bible of K Street. Wash Reps also has a Web site,
www.lobbyists.info. Unlike many of the other resources, which rely only on public filings, Wash
Reps contacts lobbyists and does extensive fact-checking of bios with lobby firms. It is a paid site but
offers free, limited trials and likely would negotiate its services.
http://www.lobbyists.info
American Law Media runs a Web site called www.influence.biz, which offers news, features,
analysis and surveys on the business of lobbying. The site includes search functions and offers free
trial passes.
http://www.influence.biz
PoliticalMoneyLine, also known as FECInfo, collects lobbying data. Access requires a subscription.

The Center for Responsive Politics collected lobbying data from 1997 to 2000. The data is searchable
by lobbying firm, lobbyist or client. Clients are broken down by industry, the same way the Center
displays campaign contributors.
http://www.opensecrets.org/lobbyists/index.asp
Professional Associations: Want more info on the major lobbying groups? Nearly every industry has a
trade group or professional association, often based in Washington and state capitals, to represent the
industry’s interests.
Look up industry associations in the Encyclopedia of Associations, available in libraries. It is online,
but not free, at http://www.galenet.com.
The American Association of Association Executives has a Web directory of associations at
http://info.asaenet.org/gateway/OnlineAssocSlist.html. The directory takes you to the site of each
association (about 6500 of them), but does not provide that neat blurb with info about each
association like the Encyclopedia of Associations does.
Law Firms: For a nationwide search, try Martindale-Hubbell at http://www.martindale.com, the useful
search engine by the publisher of the old Martindale hardbound books. If you want list of
clients, and they aren’t on the law firms’ own site (often they are), you can get them in the Martindale
print copy found in law libraries. Martindale charges to be listed, but also runs an ABA lawyer listing that
includes lawyers who have not paid to be in Martindale: http://lawyers.martindale.com/aba.
Congressional Travel: Privately funded trips are disclosed on paper at the Secretary of the Senate and
Clerk of the House’s Legislative Resource Center on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers are supposed to file the
forms within 30 days after returning from the trip. Unfortunately, the forms are not available online.
Check these links for more info on travel disclosure with Congress:
http://www.house.gov/ethics/Highlights2005a.htm
http://www.house.gov/ethics/Gifts_and_Travel_Chapter.htm
Last year, American Radio Works and Medill News Service, which is run by Northwestern
University’s Washington journalism program, gathered records on monthly congressional travel
reports and put them into a database. There are some errors in the database (e.g., some trips counted
twice), so double-check with the records filed with the clerk of the Clerk of the House and Secretary
of the Senate.
http://americanradioworks.publicradio.org/features/congtravel/
Privately sponsored travel also must be reported on members’ annual financial disclosure forms,
which contain a lot of other useful info. Like the travel reports, personal financial disclosure forms (or
PFDs) are filed with the Clerk of the House and Secretary of the Senate, and are not available online.
However, the Center for Responsive Politics makes them available at the link below for all lawmakers
and several executive branch officials.
