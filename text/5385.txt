Arcia, A. et. al. “Sometimes More Is More: Iterative participatory design of infographics for
engagement of community members with varying levels of health literacy.” Journal of the American
Medical Informatics Association. Jan;23(1):174-83. doi: 10.1093/jamia/ocv079. Epub 2015 Jul 13.

All but a few highly literate participants
interpreted the infographics in a
rigidly literal fashion resulting in
interpretations that were overly
specific. For instance, participants who
saw a version of Figure 1 with apple
icons instead of fruit cluster icons
complained about the monotony of
eating the same fruit every day.

Participants who saw both the
apple and fruit cluster versions
declared the fruit clusters a
great improvement, but those
who saw only the fruit clusters
again commented on the
monotony of eating those
specific fruits daily (“But a
whole pineapple!?”).

Why does it matter that charts may lie?
Because charts are everywhere
Because anybody can design them or share them in social media
Because charts are persuasive.

So we see more and more charts, and that’s great!
When done well, charts help us perceive patterns that may go unnoticed otherwise.

This is all great, but here’s my concern…

KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING?

A chart may lie…
1. Because it’s based on dubious data or assumptions.
2. Because it’s poorly built or not suited for the audience
it’s being shown to.
3. Because we journalists love to “simplify” when our goal
must be to clarify instead.
4. Because we humans love to lie to ourselves by coopting evidence to confirm our prejudices or agendas.
