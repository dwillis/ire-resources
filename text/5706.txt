SUBLIME TEXT EDITOR
1. Copy and paste the PDF contents into Sublime
2. To ensure the contents can be imported into
Google sheets or Excel, we must define where
to split the columns
3. CNTL + G to select (or CNRL + F to find first)
4. Add a delimiter such as *. It doesn’t have to be a
comma.
5. Save as TXT or CSV file

That’s IT.
