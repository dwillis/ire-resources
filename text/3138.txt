Investigating Ethnic Communities

Background: The Sun-Sentinel spent 11 months investigating the Seminole
Tribe of Florida and in November 2007 published a 6-part series, “Fast
Fortune, Big Spending.’’ The series revealed the story behind one of the
nation’s wealthiest tribes and how a handful of leaders had enriched
themselves at the expense of their own people.
Investigating ethnic communities, particularly Native American tribes with
no open meetings or public records, presents unique challenges. Some
approaches that worked well for us:
 Assign a reporter early in the investigation to begin cultivating
sources. Cover events and press conferences in the community,
mingle and ask for phone numbers. Break the ice with non-threatening
questions about lifestyle and culture and how it’s changed. Look for
people willing to let you spend time at their homes or jobs to better
understand life in the community. Whenever possible, take a
photographer/videographer and start building visuals of people, events
and lifestyles.
 Identify and then develop sources familiar with the inner workings of
the community, its leadership and any problems at the top. This can
include former employees, current and former elected officials and
candidates for office.
 With new sources, especially those with no experience talking to a
reporter, avoid sensitive topics initially. Have conversations that fit
their comfort zone. Once you build their trust, go for the harder
questions.
 Recognize cultural differences. Be aware ethnic communities do not
necessarily live by your standards and object to being judged by them.
This will likely be a defense to anything you might uncover. Example:
The Seminole Tribal Council members regularly voted for business

ventures benefiting themselves and their families. The defense: The
tribe has no conflict of interest rules and because of its size, all tribal
members know each other and their leaders. “If we don’t treat them
fair, they’re going to tell us,’’ one council member told us.
 Be patient and persistent. Keep in mind some communities have longstanding taboos against discussing their affairs with outsiders. You
may be stood up or turned away. Some may agree to talk and then
change their minds for fear of breaking ranks and being criticized by
others within the community. Building trust and relationships takes
time.
 Follow the money (as usual). Are the community leaders abusing their
positions of power? How do their lifestyles compare to the rest of the
community? Most tribes received federal and state grants, regardless
of their financial success. If they receive more than $300,000 a year in
federal funds, they must submit audits to the government. The Census
Bureau maintains a searchable audit database with information about
grants at:

audits are also available through FOIA requests to the Census Bureau.
