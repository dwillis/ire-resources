Authenticity: Investigating tipsters, bloggers, and Web sites
A great tipster has a position like assistant director of the
FBI and is priceless to reporters and the public interest.
A bad tipster is recommended by the Administration, has a name
like “Sideways,” and can bankrupt your credibility.
Between Deep Throat and Sideways are thousands of other sources
of news and investigative leads to help you – if you’re careful.
That means verifying. The most careful reporter might even say,
“If your mother says she loves you, verify it.” OK, believe your
mother, if it makes you feel good. But it is important to
authenticate tipsters, especially in a time of attacks on news
media credibility and sources’ motives.
To check them out, start with the basics. Circle the person:
think of every public record that may surround him or her.
Use public records to find other people with information, and
use people (including the tipster) to find public records.
Records may lie but they don’t change their stories.
Much of this work involves shoe leather. Here are ten of the
most useful places, including Web sites, to start checking
authenticity:
•

Google, obviously. Use the site:gov and site:edu delimiter
for more reliable results. For the latest web chatter, go
to Google Groups and sort by date.

•

Phone listings. Google offers rphonebook: firstname
lastname, city, ST and the same with bphonebook: (business
listings) or just phonebook: alone. These listings lead to
maps. Reverse directories will show who else lives there.

•

Court records. Not just federal court records indexed in
PACER (http://pacer.psc.uscourts.gov/) but also state and
lower courts.

•

Business records. Not just EdgarPeople
(http://access.edgar-online.com/people/peopleSearch.asp)
and the Securities and Exchange Commission
(http://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/srch-edgar) but also records
kept by the secretary of states and licensing department.
A plethora of such records is indexed by Search Systems
(http://www.searchsystems.net/) and BRB Publications
(http://brbpub.com/pubrecsites.asp). When obtaining state
business records, ask for all charter documents.

•

Vital records. Not just births or marriages or divorces
through VitalChek (http://www.vitalchek.com/), but also
check the courthouse for marriage license applications to
find close friends.

•

Real estate records from the county recorder, assessor or
title companies. Google Name-of-county Recorder Try to get
the full real estate recordings to find connections with
other people and develop a financial profile.

•

Licensing records. A good place to start is the state
licensing agency, SearchSystems or BRB Publications.

•

Compiled records. Accurint, LexisNexis, Autotrack.
Be careful: these public record brokers provide leads
but are not authoritative. The leads must be verified.

•

Web sites. Learn who registered a domain name at Who-Is
(http://www.networksolutions.com/en_US/whois/index.jhtml)

•

Web site changes. The Wayback Machine saves some past pages
(http://www.archive.org/web/web.php?PHPSESSID=5c929ae61f584
d1a0630efc665e7d455)
