Government Waste Initiative
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and WSB-TV and News/Talk 750 (WSB Radio) have teamed to examine
questionable government spending, inefficiency and waste. At least four times a week, the newspaper

carries an investigation into government spending. It might reveal a clear case of waste or fraud, or it
might just raise questions about whether tax dollars are being spent wisely. Either way, it's popular with
readers.

We are providing extensive training for all reporters who cover cities, counties, state government, and
educational institutions, as well as our 10-person Watchdog team. The newspaper is focused on
investigative and accountability reporting like never before, and leveraging resources with Cox-owned
partners.
During a recent training session, reporters identified documents, processes and reporting routines that any
reporter mining for government waste ought to master or pursue. The following page includes highlights
from a guide they developed.
