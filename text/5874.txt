Tracking advocacy campaigns across states

IRE 2019
Why look at multiple states?
Context ​- Maybe something going on in your state is also happening elsewhere
Illuminating detail ​- Maybe other states require more disclosure and thus their documents can
provide extra juicy details about a multi-state lobbying campaign
Regional or national stories
Tools of multi-state advocacy
Model legislation ​- “copycat” laws that get passed around from state to state as examples to
copy
Lobbying
Donations​ - to campaigns or nonprofits affiliated with politicians, for example
Astroturf, grassroots, grasstops campaigns​ - PR/lobbyist efforts to create relatively fake
shows of public support (astroturfing), muster public support that is actually there (grassroots),
muster support from key leaders and officials (grasstops
Conference sponsorships​ - Corporations and advocacy groups can sponsor certain dinners
etc. at conferences for state legislators or other public officials. This may give them opportunities
to get their message across or wine/dine officials
Group support ​- donations and sponsorships related to political groups like the Republican
Governors Association, for example, or nonpartisan groups like the National Lieutenant
Governors Association
Ballot measures​ - Very few restrictions in funding groups designated to support ballot
measures. The sky’s the limit!

Where to look: lobbying
Overall numbers and overviews of lobbyists
● National Institute on Money in Politics: ​https://www.followthemoney.org/
○ Campaign finance contributions, standardized and coded by industry
○ Lobbyist registrations and expenditures (where available)
○ Independent expenditures (where available)

What’s their agenda?
● Advocacy groups’ newsletters and websites - Search industry and advocacy groups’
sites for issues they are tracking, newsletters where they brag about their legislative
victories, which legislators are most supportive etc. Use Advanced Google to search for
PDF and other items on a specific site: ​https://www.google.com/advanced_search
● Lobbyists’ newsletters and websites
Using other states’ data
Triangulate by using states that have good data that can help you find similar players/issues in
your state but also more detail.
● States where lobbyists register positions on bills
○ IA - can search for all positions taken on bills by client or lobbyist
https://www.legis.iowa.gov/lobbyist/reports/declarations?ga=87&ba=SF48
1

https://lobbying.wi.gov/What/WhatAreTheyLobbyingAbout/2017REG

Digital Democracy, allows users to search all statements made in state
legislative hearings for California, Florida, New York and Texas so far:
https://www.digitaldemocracy.org/
Nevada allows you to search legislative committee minutes ​here​. You can
also easily find who testified on certain bills, etc., in the state’s ​NELIS
system.
Maine’s legislative website allows easy access to written forms of
committee testimony on bills. ​http://www.mainelegislature.org/
Illinois groups witnesses at legislative committee hearings into
proponent/opponent/no position. You can find those positions and
testimonies for committee hearings here: ​http://my.ilga.gov/
Best state legislative website for easy access to video of committee
testimony: Tennessee.

How are they doing the schmoozing?
● Lobbyists’ swanky dinners etc. In some states these would be indicated in
general lobbyist and/or expenditure filings. Also:
○ IA- “function reports” ​https://www.legis.iowa.gov/lobbyist/reports
○ MD - “event reports” ​http://search.lobby.ethics.state.md.us:8080/search
● Does your state have gift disclosures, lobbyist disclosures, online legislative
logbooks?
○ Sometimes you can pull those into Document Cloud to make them easier
to search. For example, we made the legislative journals for Michigan
easier to search:
https://www.publicintegrity.org/2018/04/26/21712/search-michigan-legislat
ures-official-logbooks
○ Consider asking for blank copies of the forms officials need to fill out so
you know the fields of data you might be able to use.
● All state legislators’ 2015 financial disclosures (searchable):
apps.publicintegrity.org/disclosure/

Where to look: group influence
Search national advocacy groups’ online materials for event agendas, guest lists for which state
officials attend, such as the Republican Attorneys General Association conferences, the
Democratic Governors Association, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners
conferences, ALEC meetings, etc. to see how special interests may be courting your officials.
Show up to these meetings to nab documents or witness the action in person.
