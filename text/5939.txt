Driveway moments: The art of long-form audio narrative
Tip sheet from Dave Cawley, host of the podcast Cold
“Lordy, I hope there are tapes”
Start with the spreadsheet
Don’t know what audio/video assets are available? Use public records requests to
obtain evidence lists or other inventories of available materials from agencies.
Don’t trust the transcript
Transcriptions of audio/video don’t always include the most interesting bits.
Police, attorneys, politicians, etc. transcribe for different reasons than storytellers.
Anticipate format frustration
Knowing the format of your source material is vital. Have the right playback gear
(analog) or software (digital) to access the tape or file handy.
Breathe life into documents with VO
Try the “Ken Burns Effect”
Using a different voice for direct quotations can help keep a listener’s attention,
but be sure to make clear what’s actual tape and what’s voiceover.
Maintain the context
Reading someone else’s words aloud involves interpretation. Inflection can
change the meaning. Strive to understand and convey the intended message.
Don’t overdo it
The goal isn’t to sound like a 1930s radio drama. Be selective in the use of VO.
The power of never-before-heard
Stand in for subtitles
Primary source audio can be difficult to understand, but sometimes worth the low
fidelity. It’s okay to explain to listeners what they are hearing.
Let it breathe
A moment or two of silence after a powerful piece of audio can lend extra gravity.
Listeners will lean in.
Every time is the first time
When tracking, try to remember how it felt to hear your best tape for the first
time. What might feel old to you after months of work will feel fresh to listeners.
