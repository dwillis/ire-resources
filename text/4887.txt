Before we begin.…

Let’s talk about the Terminal
Many of you know it as “the command line”, it looks like this:

So you might be asking, “why do we need to talk about this?
We’re here to learn about pdfs.”
Because some of the best tools for extracting data from pdfs
require a basic understanding/use of the command line.

The Terminal Continued
Most of you are familiar with clicking around & opening
programs on your computer.
The terminal is a more precise way to interact with your
computer (by typing commands).
Almost everything we do visually on a computer can be
done via the terminal with commands.

The Terminal Continued
For example to open a folder on your desktop via the terminal:
You would type: cd desktop

To list everything that’s on your desktop:
You would type: ls

To create a folder on your desktop:
You would type: mkdir

The Terminal Continued
The most important commands for this class will be
●
●
●
●
●

cd = which stands for change directory
ls = list
clear = which clears the screen
key which will automatically pull up the last command you typed
tab key which will automatically complete a filename for you

There are many other commands that are very useful.
I recommend these additional resources for you to explore.
●
●

Quick guides: 1, 2, in-depth tutorial
In-depth books: Unix/Linux, Unix/Linux, Mac, Windows

The Terminal Continued
Warning!!
●
●
●

There are NO friendly warnings to help you know when you are about to
screw up - i.e. accidentally delete an important file etc.
In other words, there are no ‘are you sure you want to do xyz’
So it is possible to completely delete everything from your computer and
cause lots of harm.

Never ever type: rm -rf in to your terminal
List of commands to avoid typing on your machine. Please read this!

So, Let’s make sure your computers are setup
1.

Let’s make sure you have all of the files:
● Hold the Command Key & Press Spacebar
● In the search type: terminal (hit enter)

2.

Inside the terminal type the following:
●
●

●
●

cd desktop (hit enter)
cd Hands (hit the tab key)
● you will see that it will auto complete the following “Hands-on\ Classes/”
● (hit enter)
cd PDFs (hit enter)
ls (hit enter)

4. You should see the following pdf files & 1 folder
●
●

Leave the terminal minimized for now (yellow jellybean button on top left corner of your window)

Part 1: Overview

Why do PDF’s matter?
- PDFs are everywhere
- Public agencies produce reports all the time -- usually in
PDF format
- Producing data tables in PDF format is the preferred
method of tormenting journalists
- Learning how to deal with them can help you turn
stories more quickly.

Types of PDFs
- Native: typically the most friendly
-

Mostly text-based
Produced from a spreadsheet or other electronic report
Many can be handled with open-source tools

- Image or Scanned: not always friendly
-

OCR is the way to go
Can be handled with open source tools, depending on quality

Important: So how do you know which is which?
Simple answer: Open the pdf, can you highlight text? If yes, then native.

Hands-On 0: Let’s discover if a PDF is Native or Scanned
On your desktop
●
●
●
●

Open Hands On Classes Folder
Open PDFS Folder
Now Open each of the 3 pdfs
Check whether they can be highlighted or not

So what’s the verdict? What kind of PDFs are these?

There are other ways to determine if a pdf is native of scanned take a look below.
Source, Source Source, Source

Workflow & Checklist for Grabbing PDF Data
Before you begin any project you should think things through.
1.

Take Inventory of your PDFs
●
●
●
●
●
●
●

How sensitive is the content in your pdfs? Is it locked/encrypted?
Are your pdfs native or scanned? What language(s) are they in?
How many pdfs are you trying to convert?
How large is each pdf?
Do you need all pages or just a few?
Are you looking for specific type of field/data/table?
How accurate do you need to be (fair - extremely accurate)?

2. Determine your budget/constraints (time, money, and computation wise)
3. Assess your skill level (clueless, command line proficient, can code, superstar)
4. Select tool & convert pdf (for scanned pfs there will be additional steps)

Part 2 Tools for Grabbing PDF Data

The Landscape
There are 3 dimensions for categorizing pdf tools:
● Native v.s. Scanned Images (non ocr v.s. ocr)
● Command Line vs User Friendly (command line vs graphic user interface)
● Free vs Paid (proprietary vs open source)

Part 3. Hands-on Practice

Hands-on 1
The story:
It’s 2013 you are working on a story about the election in New Jersey & you
need data from the following pdf:
“2013-official-general-election-voter-turnout.pdf”
Do the following:
●
●
●

Go to the terminal window that you minimized
Type: pdftotext 2013-official-general-election-voter-turnout.pdf (hit enter)
Now type: open 2013-official-general-election-voter-turnout.txt (hit enter)

But wait, what about formatting?
●
●

Type: pdftotext -layout 2013-official-general-election-voter-turnout.pdf
Now type: open 2013-official-general-election-voter-turnout.txt

Hands-on 1 continued
Let’s recap what we just typed:
pdftotext 2013-official-general-election-voter-turnout.pdf
pdftotext -layout 2013-official-general-election-voter-turnout.pdf
Software

specific command

file name

Breakdown:
pdftotext tells your computer to run pdftotext software
-layout maintains original physical layout of the file
2013-official-general-election-voter-turnout.pdf the file you’re processing

Hands-on 2
The story:
It’s Feb 2016 you are trying to predict which political parties will win in Nevada
on a county by county basis to do this you need data from the following pdf:
“Nevada_Voter_Reg_Feb_2016.pdf”
Turn to your neighbor (i.e. person next to you) and take turns teaching
each other how to do the following:
●
●

Extract the text without preserving any layout formatting
Extract the text and preserve the layout

Hands-on 2 continued
Who would like to volunteer which commands worked for
them?
Hint there’s a prize if you volunteer :)

Hands-on 2 continued
Let’s recap what we just typed:
pdftotext Nevada_Voter_Reg_Feb_2016.pdf

Hands-on 3
The story:
It’s 2013, you are reporting on schools in Springfield Illinois, they recently released their
annual report & you need data from this pdf:
“SpringfieldSchoolDistrict.pdf”
You are interested in the following:
●
●

The Statement of revenues & expenditures (page 37)
10 Years of School Building Data (pages 131 - 134)

Work with your neighbor on the following:
●
●
●

HINT: Before you begin you might want to try typing pdftotext -h into the terminal
there might be a command there to help you
Extract text from page 37 while preserving the layout
Extract pages 131 - 134 while preserving the layout and saving the file as
‘10_years_of_school_data.txt”

Hands-on 3 continued
Who would like to volunteer and share which commands
worked for them? Hint there’s a prize if you volunteer :)

Hands-on 3 continued
Let’s recap what we just typed:
pdftotext -layout -f 37 SpringfieldSchoolDistrict.pdf 10_years_of_school_data_file1.txt
pdftotext -layout -f 131 -l 134 SpringfieldSchoolDistrict.pdf 10_years_of_school_data_file2.txt

Breakdown:
●
●

pdftotext starts the pdftotext program
-layout maintains the layout of the file
-f first page to start extracting
-l last page to extract
SpringfieldSchoolDistrict.pdf your data source
10_years_of_school_building_data.txt file you are saving your data to

Hands-on 4
Now we are going to use a friendlier tool to do the same
things.
It’s called tabula.
Tabula was created by journalists for journalists who were
frustrated of working with pdfs containing tables.

Hands-on 4 continued
●

●
●
●
●
●
●
●

Open the hands-on folder on your desktop
○ Open the PDFs folder
○ Open the Tabula Folder
○ Click on Tabula icon (should look like a green pdf icon)
○ Double click to run the program (it will open in your browser)
Click browse
Locate the folder with our hands-on pdfs find the following file: 2013official-general-election-voter-turnout.pdf
Select it and click on import
Now let’s draw a box around the table we would like to extract
Hit preview & export data
From export format, select CSV
Hit Export

Hands-on 4 Continued
Now, do the following:
Use Tabula to extract data from the pdfs we used in hands-on exercises 1 thru 3.

Pretty neat, right.
So why can’t we use Tabula for everything?
Tabula has limitations, table quality limitation, language limitations, headers,
doesn’t handle ocr, etc.

Part 4. Conclusion

Final Thoughts
●
●
●

●
●

Always save original document(s) & create copies to work with
Understand the nature of your project
○ Use the pdf workflow/checklist
Study your PDFs
○ Are they native or scanned?
○ Address your constraints (budget, time, etc)
Play around with several tools to see what works.
Learn a tiny bit of command line & coding
○ Start by learning how to use the command-line / terminal
○ Then learn some very basic and intermediate excel
○ Finally learn some python

Optical Character Recognition (OCR)?
OCR software converts images of text into machine-encoded text (i.e. text files)

Used For :
● Data entry for business documents, e.g depositing money
● Automatic number plate recognition
● Extracting business card information into a contact list
● Quickly make textual versions of printed documents, e.g. book scanning
● Make images of printed documents searchable, e.g. Google Books

Quick Profiles of PDF Tools

For the next slides we have profiles of each tool
with some quick comments and ideas of their
use.

Cometdocs (free, mostly)
- Web-based with drag-and-drop interface
- Easier to use than XPDF
- Can be better for native PDFs
- Converts some scanned PDFs
- Converts to many formats: excel, text, word,
etc.

Tabula
- http://tabula.technology/
- Open source
- Converts to excel or CSV
- Works well for native PDFs
- Friendly interface

Adobe Acrobat Pro
- It costs money, a fair amount of it
- Check your organization for extra licenses
- Exports to excel or text
- If the PDF is native, fidelity is pretty high

Google Drive
- https://support.google.
com/drive/answer/176692?hl=en
- Open source
- Converts to pdfs to text
- Works well for native and scanned PDFs
- Friendly interface
- Free Hosting

DocumentCloud
- Great for processing documents and
enabling text search
- Better for blocks of text than for tabular data
- I’ve used it for 100,000s of pages of PDFs
- Pairs nicely with overview

Foolabs XPDF
- My first love -- and still works OK
- http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf
- Free, run out of the command line
- IRE Tipsheet 3440 -- shortcut
- Use for native PDFs -- text-based and clean
- Use -layout or -table for conversion
- Might want to learn some basic RegEx for
cleaning

Foolabs XPDF part 2
Most Typical Code / Commands:
pdftotext yourfilename.pdf
pdftotext -layout yourfilename.pdf
pdftotext -table yourfilename.pdf
pdfinfo -- dumps a PDF file's Info dictionary (plus some other useful information)
pdffonts -- lists the fonts used in a PDF file along with various information for each
font
pdfdetach -- lists or extracts embedded files (attachments) from a PDF file
pdftoppm -- converts a PDF file to a series of PPM/PGM/PBM-format bitmaps
pdfimages -- extracts the images from a PDF file
For batches of pdfs run : for i in *pdf; do b=`basename "$i" .pdf`; pdftotext "$i" "$b.txt" ; done

Tesseract
Awesome open source tool used by many
people to ocr images
DocumentCloud uses this as does google

Tesseract. But Wait !
You said Tesseract could be used to OCR
images.
Thats right images. But you have a PDF
So first you need to turn PDF into images

ImageMagick
Typical Code / Commands:
PDF to JPG - Simple pdf to jpg
convert demo.pdf demo.jpg
PDF to JPG - Single page
convert demo.pdf[2] demo.jpg
PDF to JPG - Specifying a page range
convert file.pdf[5-10] images/image.png
Clearing up text so its easier to read in output
convert -density 200 -scale x800 demo.pdf demo jpg

Tesseract
Code / Commands:
Basic image to text : tesseract filename.tiff outputfilename
More advanced image to text: tesseract input.tif output.txt -l eng -psm 1
Multiple images to Multiple TXT : for i in *tif; do b=`basename "$i" .tif`; tesseract "$i" "$b" ; done
Multiple images to Multiple HOCR :for i in *tif; do b=`basename "$i" .tif`; tesseract "$i" "$b" hocr; done
Turn a non-searchable PDF into a searchable one: tesseract -l eng input.tif output pdf
Output HOCR format which is HTML with bounding boxes representing the
coordinates of each word : tesseract input.tif output.html -l eng -psm 1 hocr

Mechanical Turk
Mechanical Turk is a microtasking service
Similar to taskrabbit. You can use it to
transcribe pdfs, especially good for handwritten
stuff.
Simple Guide & Academic Guide on Usage

Captricity
Captricity allows you to create a template from
a document and capture specific fields.
Then you can run a huge batch for similar
documents with the same fields.
Accuracy is claimed to be 99.9%

Mobile OCR
There are some apps for doing OCR from your
phone
