Look for the financial statement footnote labeled "INCOME TAXES."
Here's Home Depot's disclosure (p. 51):
The Company has not provided for deferred income taxes on approximately
$3.5 billion of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries because of
its intention to indefinitely reinvest these earnings outside the U.S. The
determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred income tax liability
related to the undistributed earnings is not practicable; however,
unrecognized foreign income tax credits would be available to reduce a
portion of this liability.
Search for similar language, phrases like "permanently reinvest" or
"indefinitely reinvest" or "undistributed earnings."

ETHICS WAIVER JUST PART OF RED ROBIN'S 'UNBRIDLED CULTURE'
Date: November 16, 2004
By David Milstead, Rocky Mountain News
Red Robin Gourmet Burgers tells Web site visitors that the company's core values "create an unbridled culture . . . Sometimes extraordinary things happen
as a result of our 'Unbridled' philosophy, we call these 'Unbridled Acts.' "
The company's board of directors created another kind of unbridled act recently when it waived its code of ethics for its CEO, Mike Snyder, and its senior
vice president of operations, Robert J. Merullo.
It seems that Snyder and Merullo, in addition to their roles as Red Robin executives, own just more than one-third of Mach Robin LLC. Mach Robin is a
company that operates 32 Red Robin restaurants in Illinois, New Mexico, Idaho and Nevada and Canada.
Mach Robin has the area development agreement for Boise, Idaho, and plans to expand into nearby Meridian, Idaho. To do this, Red Robin had to waive its
company code of ethics on "diversion of corporate opportunity" for Snyder and Merullo. Then, under the terms of the Sarbanes-Oxley corporategovernance law, it had to disclose the waiver in an 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The code, posted on the Red Robin Web site says this: "You may not take advantage of a corporate opportunity yourself or give it to another person or firm.
Your duty to the Company is to make sure that the Company knows of the opportunity and has a fair chance to decide whether to pursue that opportunity."
Chief Financial Officer James McCloskey said Red Robin, which has 130 company-owned stores and 116 franchised locations, "would never add one unit in
Boise in the middle of a franchise territory," so it's not interested in an opportunity to engage in that business. "Any time that franchisee adds a store, we're
going to have this waiver of the code of ethics."
What about the larger issue of having a CEO also be a franchisee? Doesn't Snyder benefit more from the dollars Mach Robin can keep away from Red Robin,
rather than from the dollars Mach Robin sends to the corporate parent? In 2003, Mach Robin and its Canadian affiliate paid nearly $1.8 million in royalties
to Red Robin.
McCloskey notes that Snyder was a franchisee before he ever joined the corporate parent. "What screwed it all up is they made Snyder the CEO," he jokes.
Why hasn't Snyder, who made more than $950,000 in salary and bonus in 2003, sold out his minority interest in Mach Robin? McCloskey says the Red Robin
board is "legally focused" on potential conflicts and since "every (franchisee) gets the same deal, there aren't a lot of (ways), if Mike wanted to favor the
franchisee, he could."
Also, McCloskey said that Snyder's Red Robin stock - he owns almost 10 percent of the company - represents a "much, much bigger risk" than Mach Robin.
"He's not going to screw up Red Robin to help his franchise." (I did the math: His Red Robin stock is worth more than $70 million at the company's recent
highs.)
This, however, is not an isolated example of Red Robin's insider ties.
The Red Robin proxy discloses that the company spent $273,200 in 2003 on an "indoor plant maintenance supplier," Tropical Interiors, operated by Brad
Snyder, brother of the CEO. Tropical Interiors provided services to the headquarters and the company's Colorado restaurants.
McCloskey said Tropical Interiors, owned by Brad Snyder's wife, Nancy, has a long-standing relationship with Red Robin and that the business existed before
the two married.
Brad Snyder declined to comment, saying Tropical Interiors does not talk about its customers.
Were it not for "so much grief from this environment of conflict of interest," Red Robin would probably use Tropical Interiors for all its restaurants,
McCloskey said.
Investors seem not to care about these matters. Red Robin stock topped $50 last week, a rapid return from its $12 IPO price in July 2002. It's up 60 percent
this year, and it's up 7.7 percent from last Tuesday, when the ethics waiver was disclosed.
You could even say it's "unbridled."

THERE'S GRISTLE IN ROBIN'S BEEF
Date: August 24, 2005
By David Milstead, Rocky Mountain News
Red-flag Robin?

If you were caught by surprise earlier this month when Red Robin Gourmet Burgers CEO Michael Snyder "retired" after racking up unapproved expenses
from the company, you weren't alone. Investors drove the stock down 24 percent in the first day they digested (or indigested) the news.
But the company provides a cautionary tale for investors who follow the maxim of buying stocks of easy-to-understand companies whose products they
themselves enjoy. Who couldn't take a bite of a Red Robin burger, see the happy families chowing down around them and recognize a money-making
opportunity?
The next step in that process, however, needs to be due diligence. And any investor who peeked into Red Robin's SEC filings could find some gristle in Red
Robin's beef.
In October 2004, the company's board waived its ethics policy to allow Snyder, who was also a franchisee, to open a new restaurant. I wrote a column
about that, noting the company said its core values "create an unbridled culture" that can allow "unbridled acts.”
Such as the company spending $273,200 in 2003 on indoor plants from a company operated by Brad Snyder, brother of the CEO. Chief Financial Officer
James McCloskey said if it were not for "so much grief from this environment of conflict of interest," Red Robin probably would buy all its plants from
brother Snyder.
You want grief? Here's what's happened since then. McCloskey made brain-dead comments about how the company doesn't like to hire "urban" workers,
then got moved to a new job a few weeks later.
Then the Snyder disclosure, which also was accompanied by McCloskey's resignation. After refusing to disclose the extent of the problem Aug. 11, Red
Robin came clean Friday in its 10-Q, saying Snyder spent $1.25 million since 2001 on unauthorized expenses.
It had to take a charge to earnings because the board had given Snyder the gift of accelerated stock options back in 2002.
Plus, the company disclosed two new accounting issues. It botched its cash-flow statement, and it admitted adding free employee meals to revenue. The
latter was not a small matter: 1.4 percent of Red Robin's sales were actually comp meals.
Add those two problems to a previous restatement for the way it accounted for leases for its restaurants.
It's reasonable to ask:
•
If a company can't figure out that its CEO shouldn't also be a franchisee, and that it shouldn't pay his brother almost $300K for plants, what other
"unbridled" acts might be taking place?
•
Have we heard the last of the Red Robin problems?
•
Is new CEO Dennis Mullen, who was part of the board's audit committee, the best person to deliver the solution?
Because Red Robin also simultaneously lowered its guidance on Snyder-departure day, the market reaction may have been primarily financial. At least one
analyst, however, asked "what message does it send" to have Snyder remain with Red Robin as a consultant.
"It's totally inconsequential in terms of financial basis," Mullen said. (The company later revealed Snyder would be unpaid.)
"No, I was thinking more from an ethical standpoint," the analyst replied.
"I wouldn't go out and make assumptions at this time on that basis," he responded.
Why not? Sometimes, when you think the worst of a company, you turn out to be right.

Non-GAAP earnings

So what is EBITDA, anyway?
Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation
and Amortization tries to approximate cash
earned in the quarter.

It also weeds out expenses that vary from
company to company due to past management
decisions and attempts to measure the
fundamental earnings of the business.

E-B-I-T-D-A
• Interest costs: A company that has financed its past
investments through debt will have interest costs
higher than one that has not.
• Taxes: A company that has losses in its recent past may
be using credits that lower its annual tax bill. A more
profitable company may be paying a higher tax rate
because it doesn’t have the same tax-advantaged
status.
• Depreciation and amortization are annual, non-cash
expenses that represent a long-term asset that’s used
year after year. In nearly all cases, the asset is bought
and paid for; it’s a “sunk cost.”

How do you calculate it?
EBITDA is, essentially, a company’s operating
income (which is income before interest and
taxes) with the non-cash depreciation and
amortization added back in.

So why not use cash flow?
As a strict measure of cash in and cash out,
operating cash flow must account for changes in
accounts payable, accounts receivable,
inventory, and other items under management’s
control.
- Slow down in paying your bills? More cash.
- Acquire more inventory? Less cash.

When EBITDA is not good enough
What kinds of things are companies leaving out?
Some of the major categories:
• Asset impairments
• Stock-based compensation expense
• Restructuring or other “non-recurring”
expenses
