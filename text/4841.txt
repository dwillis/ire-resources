Excel is great for...

Excel is great for:
● Quick calculations
● Exploring and interacting with data
● Filtering and sorting small- to
medium-sized data sets

Excel isn’t great for...

Excel isn’t great for:
● Handling large data sets
● Complex filtering and sorting
● Remembering how you created that
one cell that is off on its own, and why
you created it in the first place.
● Keeping your original data intact.

Databases
● Fast
● Powerful
● Easy to reproduce
● Transparent
● Don’t alter your data

If you have experience with Excel, you
are more than ready to start using
databases and SQL.

Speed + power

Easy to reproduce

Pointing and clicking: nice for short-term
exploration, but bad when you have to
do it more than once.
Data diaries are helpful, but you still
have to rely on slow, error-prone manual
work.

With SQL, your analysis is
your data diary.

Save your time by writing a
SQL query once, then reuse
your work in the future.

Build your own SQL
“cookbook” that includes
recipes for common queries.

Transparency

Because all of your analysis is
written down as code, you can
easily share your methodology.
