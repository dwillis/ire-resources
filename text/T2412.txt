Understanding Military Aviation

Within the continental United States, military aircraft often are in contact with FAA controllers and follow civilian
rules. Military aircraft have exclusive use of restricted military-only airspace. Military Operations Area (MOA)
airspace is shared with civilian aircraft, but military has right-of-way. Military aircraft have both civilian (FAA)
and military-only radio frequencies.
Phases of typical military flights:
1. Takeoff/Departure (typically lasts until reaching 10,000 feet, high workload)
2. Enroute (the “cruise” portion of the flight, usually has the lightest workload)
3. Aerial Refueling (on long flights, high workload, close formation flying)
4. Mission (the actual or practice military purpose of flight, high workload)
5. Repeat 2 or 3 or 4 as necessary (depends on flight distance and duration)
6. Approach/Landing (typically below 10,000 feet descending to land, high workload)

Crash rules of thumb: Multiple factors usually involved. More likely during the high-workload phases of flight.
Bad weather or poor visibility magnify the impact of aircraft problems and pilot errors.
Aircraft problems are often the culprit: Crash on takeoff. Crash enroute. Single aircraft crash in daylight and good
weather.
Pilot errors are often the culprit: Crash on approach/landing. Crash in low visibility. Crash in bad weather. Crash at
night. Crash refueling. CFIT – Controlled Flight Into Terrain. Multi-aircraft crash.
(Note: these are the author’s personal opinion based on experience as civilian pilot and journalist.)
Basic questions to ask in event of a military plane crash:
Single or multiple aircraft involved?
Flight phase?
Day or Night? - Weather/Visibility?
Was aircraft in contact with FAA?
Focus questions on both pilot qualifications and aircraft condition.
Obtain as much crash detail as possible from as many sources as possible.
Check military safety center website for statistics and safety magazine articles.
Class A accidents: Military classification for any loss-of-aircraft or fatality accident. Annual statistics for Class A
aviation accidents are available on-line. (Class B & C incidents may indicate problem trends.)
