 The growing business of Pet Leasing
Pet stores lure consumers in with cute puppies and prices posted on Facebook. Once in
store, the prices go up. Pet store employees tell the consumers they can get approved
for a loan, without disclosing the interest rate or the fact that they are actually signing a
lease. In some cases, there are 2 or 3 loans taken out for one dog when the consumer
cannot get approved for the full price of the dog. One of the leases for one of the
consumers we spoke with came with a 130% interest rate.
Pet leases are now illegal in California, Nevada & NY. If you live anywhere else, this
type of predatory lending is likely unregulated.
https://www.click2houston.com/news/investigates/is-pet-leasing-more-bark-or-bite
Tips/ resources: Look for victims by requesting complaints to your state Attorney
General’s Office or local Better Business Bureau against some of the most well known
pet leasing companies: Wags Lending, My Pet Funding and Easy Pay Finance. Stop by
local pet stores to see if the signs are posted inside for any of these lenders.

Toilet Trouble
Faulty toilet tanks crack with no warning, causing thousands of dollars in damage to
homes

Vortens toilets are manufactured in Mexico. They are sold all over the US and many
prominent home builders installed the toilets in new homes. We discovered thousands of
the tanks spontaneously cracking in 2016. As the water leaks, the toilets continue to run
to try and fill the tank back up. In many cases, the homeowner was at work or on
vacation for days. They came home to a flooded house. The manufacturer refused to
take responsibility until a class action lawsuit was filed. They just settled in May 2019,
agreeing to pay to replace only the toilets made in 2011 with 2 specific model
numbers. There are many consumers though with Vortens toilets made in other years
that have also failed and cracked.
https://www.click2houston.com/consumer/large-toilet-manufacturer-agrees-to-payhomeowners-up-to-4000-for-faulty-toilets-after-lawsuit
Original story in 2016: https://www.click2houston.com/news/investigates/companysfaulty-toilet-causing-thousands-in-damages
“When one of the toilets cracked… up to outcue: “and all throughout the Houston area.”
Tips/ resources:
https://www.vortenssettlement.com/
The Plano, TX attorney filing the class action: Scott Carpenter
(https://www.cstriallaw.com/) can tell you if he has any clients in your area; but many
people who have these toilets in their homes may not even realize there is a potential
problem.
Carpenter is waiting for the judge’s ruling on whether he can add Vortens toilets
manufactured from 2004 to 2012 to this suit.
Use social media like NextDoor to find people who have the toilets and any victims
whose home may have already flooded.

AT&T Fiber project- damaging plumbing, underground electric lines across the
country
AT&T is installing fiber optics all over the country to increase its internet speeds. It has
hired hundreds of contractors who hire subs to do this underground drilling. In cities all
across the country, they are hitting underground plumbing, electric and other utility
lines… and then sticking homeowners with the repair costs.
https://www.click2houston.com/consumer/att-project-bringing-faster-internet-leavingdamage-headaches-in-its-wake
We did this story in Feb. 2018, but the AT&T Fiber project is ongoing across the country.
You will notice the digging if it is happening in your city.
Tips/ resources:
Fortunately, AT&T has an interactive map that shows us where the company has
already installed fiber lines… and where the work is in progress:
https://www.att.com/shop/internet/gigapower/coverage-map.html See your area?

Some news outlets have asked local municipalities how much damage AT&T has done
to city-owned lines and wires underground. You could contact city officials or submit an
open records request to get this information.

Counterfeit Amazon/ Ebay items (How to do the testing yourself)
https://www.click2houston.com/consumer/consumers-duped-by-fake-products-onamazon-ebay
In Jan. 2018, The Government Accountability Office released a study that revealed 20
out of 47 products its’ investigators ordered online were fake. Here is their study:
https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-18-216
We took that a step further when we discovered a business in our own backyard
advertising & selling counterfeit Macbook chargers on Ebay. We were able to send the
charger to a forensics lab to test it to determine that it was fake.
We also tested cosmetics & an As Seen on TV product we purchased on Amazon.
Tips/ Resources:
We used Pro Quality Labs in Cartersville, GA. http://www.proqualitylab.com/ to test
make-up & toothpaste. We used Verite Forensics in Conroe to test the charger.

Jacuzzi Deaths in tubs marketed to seniors
This story by Joel Eisenbaum of KPRC Channel 2 revealed that Jacuzzi tubs marketed
to senior citizens are deadly. A product testing lab in Houston discovered a major flaw in
the tubs that has led to the death of more than one person, but Jacuzzi is not recalling
the tubs.
https://www.click2houston.com/news/jacuzzi-tubs-pose-safety-concern-for-elderly
Tips/ resources:
Joel found this story by connecting with a product testing firm in Houston. They test all
sorts of products in product liability cases. You can check with your local BBB for
complaints against Jacuzzi to find other victims. Set up a meeting with a product testing
company in your city so they will contact you when they have newsworthy cases they
can discuss.
Overbilling & Inaccurate Medical Bills
This is one of those topics that will almost always generate more tips and leads when
you do one story. In February, we did a week-long series on our morning show that we
called “Wake up 2 Health Care Savings.” The stories were short, but helpful. By the end
of the week, we could have easily done 2 weeks of stories just following up on all of the
emails and calls that came in to our newsroom.

Link2Labs can help uninsured hepatitis C patients get free medication if they do some
pretreatment labs. Tests that normally cost about $2,000 are just $64 on Link2Labs.

Temporary License Plates Sold for Cash Online
https://www.click2houston.com/news/investigates/temporary-license-plates-being-soldfor-cash
You see temporary paper license plates on vehicles everywhere. They are meant to be
used when a car is being titled before a permanent plate arrives. But Channel 2
investigative reporter Joel Eisenbaum found people selling bogus paper plates online.
Criminals use these bogus tags so law enforcement can not trace vehicles used in
crimes back to them. They are also not paying taxes on the vehicles.
Tips/ resources:
Check Facebook Marketplace & Craigslist for people selling “paper tags.”

Secret Toll Court
If you have toll roads in your viewing area, this is a story worth checking out. What
happens to those drivers who don’t believe they owe the fines that have been levied
against them? In Harris County, they are remanded to Toll Court. Unlike a regular
courtroom, the cases, outcomes and fines are not public information. In Harris County,
the Toll Road Authority contracts with a private law firm to handle debt collection. That
private law firm is not subject to the same laws as debt collectors that require them to
show evidence that you owe a debt, etc.
https://www.click2houston.com/news/investigates/expired-credit-cards-leavehoustonians-with-expensive-toll-payments
Tips/ Resources:
Ask about the process for contesting or appealing a fine from the toll road. Just show up
to the courtroom and observe. You can talk with consumers & collect names and
numbers in the hall outside.
How often does my family need dental x-rays? What are warning signs you need a
2nd opinion?
This story comes from Joe Ducey, a consumer investigative reporter at ABC 15 in
Phoenix. He does daily consumer stories. This one came from simply asking his vi ewers
on social media what they wanted to know about. His daily stories are often 1 minute to
1:30.
https://www.abc15.com/news/let-joe-know/is-your-dentist-over-selling
Flipping is one of the most prevalent towing scams across the country
This practice is when a tow truck driver tricks a consumer (usually flustered after an
accident) into letting them tow the vehicle to a body shop that they either own or get
kickbacks from. They ask the consumer to sign paperwork “authorizing the tow.” But the
paperwork is actually giving the body shop authorization to “tear down” the vehicle.
When the consumer’s insurance adjustor comes to see the vehicle, they learn the body
shop is already charging thousands of dollars for nonsense “tear down” and “make
ready” fees.
https://www.click2houston.com/consumer/houston-tow-company-accused-of-deceivingdrivers-into-costly-auto-repairs
Tips/ resources:
Ask your state’s department of insurance and local regulators of towing and storage
companies who the biggest offenders are. In Houston, there is a special unit at HPD that
investigates this fraud. Towing companies are also licensed by the Texas Department of
Licensing & Regulation. Find out who regulates the businesses in your area. You can
also ask the BBB for complaints against tow companies.

Consumer Quickies and Long Form - Nydia Han and Chad Pradelli,
WPVI-TV

Revenge on Robocalls - Robocalls enrage all consumers. Show your viewers how to silence
robocalls and make some money in the process. The Federal Telephone Consumer Protection
Act or TCPA says telemarketers cannot robocall your cell phone unless you’ve specifically
consented to it in writing. And if they violate the TCPA, you’re entitled to $500 to $400 per
violation, meaning per illegal call. We featured a guy shot by the Pittsburgh ABC station who
won a $300,000 judgement. A 23-year-old man in the Philadelphia area recently won a $33,000
judgement.
Tips/Resources:
-Call consumer attorneys to find plaintiffs in your area..
- Good resource to start: http://www.creditlaw.com/

Craiglist Cars - About a third of all used cars are now sold online and by private
individuals. And with 63-million cars in the U.S. with unaddressed safety recalls, we expected
we might find some questionable advertising claims. But we did not expect the explanations we
received! The Troubleshooters went undercover for this one - posing as buyers for vehicles
listed on Craigslist.
Tips/Resources:
-The folks at www.Carfax.com are always willing to help with stories and can be a great
resource. If you haven’t used them yet, give them a call.. You’ll get at least a few good stories!
-We looked at cars that were listed as being in “good” or “excellent” condition. Carfax then
provided reports for those vehicles and we confronted the sellers of vehicles that had open
recalls, branded titles, salvage titles, etc..

Home Inspector Undercover - Potential home buyers entrust home inspectors to look for
flaws to help avoid buying a money pit. But our hidden camera investigation found that some
are not as reliable as you think.
Tips/Resources:
-This investigation got huge numbers online and on our website.. But guess what, it was an
investigation by www.checkbook.org that they shared with us..
-For its undercover investigation, Checkbook rented a 3-bedroom house and then hired twelve
random home inspectors to check it out. Checkbook identified 28 problems that it thought were
just too obvious for home inspectors to miss. Their investigation found that nine inspectors
never raised a ladder to look at the roof. Seven inspectors missed a major leak, plus a defective
garbage disposal with faulty wiring. And four inspectors failed to record obvious signs of water
damage. Checkbook magazine said as a group, the inspectors caught the 28 obvious problems
only half the time.
-Checkbook Magazine has been a great resource for us in terms of information and hidden
camera video the magazine is willing to share. It publishes magazines specifically for Boston,
Chicago, the Delaware Valley, Puget Sound area, Twin Cities area, and the Washington DC

area but also has a national component. If you don’t know Kevin Brasler at Checkbook
Magazine yet, get to know him!
Our story:
https://6abc.com/realestate/hidden-camera-investigation-home-inspectors/3483263/
We also partnered with Checkbook Magazine for this one:
Bogus Bargains: Stores are always advertising sales, but are they really offering you a great
deal? As it turns out, a nearly year-long test has found potentially disturbing pricing policies at
more than a dozen national retailers. Checkbook Magazine found that, too often, sale prices
aren't offering you special savings at all. Instead, they're creating a bogus sense of urgency to
buy. Over the course of 10 months, Checkbook Magazine's undercover shoppers tracked
prices of select items available for at least five weeks at 19 major retailers. They found in most
cases, the advertised sale price was actually the routine price: the one the store charges more
than half the time. Of course, you could do this investigation on your own!

Ugly Side of Cheap Cosmetic Procedures - Discount internet sites often offer deals
seemingly too good to pass up. But an Action News Investigation warns of an ugly side to
cosmetic procedures on the cheap. Advertisements claim up to 91% off for liposuction, Botox,
and even Brazilian butt lifts. Action News dug into the background of two dozen area doctors
providing deep discounts on Groupon. We found nearly 1 in 4 had been disciplined or charged
by their respective state medical boards within the past decade. These included a chiropractor
who did time behind bars for health care fraud, and doctors disciplined for watering down Botox,
and another for administering improper drugs.
Tips/Resources:
-Do an internet search for Groupon and “cosmetic procedures” in your area
-Check the doctor’s medical records and put findings in a database
Our story:
https://6abc.com/health/investigation-dark-side-of-cheap-cosmetic-procedures/4599398/
Bogus Online Reviews- Consumers put a lot of trust in online reviews. They believe real
people are providing the real scoop on products and businesses. But beware - many reviews
are paid for by companies to make themselves look good - or by a rival business to make their
competitors look bad! We highlighted clearly bogus reviews for a local plumber and a fitness
trainer. The reviewers were posted by the same trio that posted positive reviews for a bail
bondsman in San Diego and a psychic in Canada.
Tips/Resources:
-Check out www.Reviewfraud.org and talk to website operator, Jason Brown
-Using his leads on companies to investigate, we put every review in a database and then
cross-referenced to look for patterns and suspicious posts on Google.. You could also try Yelp
and other sites.
-Create a page for a business on Facebook or elsewhere and hire someone from Task Rabbit
or Fiverr.com to post bogus reviews. We were able to hire someone to post reviews on our
Facebook business page within 24 hours!

The Dark Side of the Solar Industry:
Sales:
The sales pitch for solar panels can be pretty tempting: save money on electricity at little or NO
cost to you.. But our Troubleshooters investigation reveals the deals can be pretty confusing
and some consumers complain savings didn’t materialize. We have complaints and hidden
camera video to help you cut through the jargon.
Damage:
Consumers claim solar panels caused major damage to their homes.. and companies are failing
to fix it. We look at allegations of shoddy work, damage, and a failure to repair.
Tips/Resources:
The companies we highlighted operate in markets all across the country. If you look for
complaints, you’ll find them. Check with your state Attorney General or local BBB or put a call
out for complaints on social media.

Construction Crisis - The Action News Troubleshooters have been shining a light on a
construction failure of epidemic proportions since 2016. Water intrusion is impacting hundreds
of homeowners across the Delaware Valley. There are entire neighborhoods suffering from this
defect, which can cost upwards of six figures to fix.
This is also happening in homes and entire developments all across the country. After the
Troubleshooters' initial push for more protection for homeowners, there is finally a glimmer of
hope for those affected in the future. But people who already dealing with this construction
defect need help now.
Tips/Resources:
-Talk to construction attorneys in your area to see if they have any cases
-Look for Facebook groups talking about big builders and residential developers in your area
-Reach out to reputable home inspectors who specialize in water intrusion and get video of
them opening up the walls of a home. This can have dramatic results. But DO be careful about
the home inspector you use! Our best expert specializes in stucco and home inspection,
thermal imaging, and does building envelope forensic consulting.
-Talk to legislators to better protect homeowners. We finally got legislation introduced this past
year.
Our latest story with videos to our previous pieces:

Elevator Dangers - An Action News investigation found an alarming number of elevators have
expired certificates of operations and had not been inspected in the time required by
law. Records from the state showed more than 1600 elevators in our five-county region had
expired Certificates of Operation. One major college had an elevator that hadn’t been inspected

since 2015. We also interviewed a sheriff deputy who is now paralyzed from the chest down
after an elevator accident. As a result of our investigation, the state agency in charge of
elevators is now going through its inspection records and issuing warning letters to business
owners out of compliance.
Tips/Resources:
-Find out what your state rules are regarding elevator inspections
-In PA, the Department of Labor and Industry oversees elevator inspections and elevators are
required to be inspected every 6 months for a valid certificate of occupancy.
-We did a Right to Know request for all certificates of operation for our 5-county region then
looked to see who is non-compliant. We then reached out to all the places, including schools,
churches, and malls, listed as non-compliant and asked them to provide us with a certificate
within the required time period.
-What we found is the state wasn’t keeping up with inspections. The onus is basically on the
building owner to make sure elevators are inspected in a timely manner and buildings are
compliant.

Abuse in Nursing Homes - A federal audit found an alarming number of nursing homes are
failing to report suspected abuse, including sexual abuse. We decided to investigate local
nursing homes. We looked at every state inspection report in the 5 county region for 2016 and
2017. We found dozens of cases where nursing homes failed to properly investigate and report
neglect, abuse or possible abuse both physical and sexual.
Tips/Resources:
-PA puts nursing home inspections, known as surveys, online (Right to know to your state
asking for all nursing home inspections) http://sais.health.pa.gov/commonpoc/NHLocatorIE.asp
-We went through every inspection of every nursing home in our region and put the info in a
database (Warning - the database was 300 pages online and this was labor intensive and timeconsuming)
-Sorted and filtered violations to find trends and info to highlight
Our story:

Driver Beware of Hertz - A national rental car company is being forced to pay tens of
thousands of dollars after mistakenly reporting some of their vehicles as stolen. The issue with
its computer system has led to the arrest of and even jail time for paying customers. We
identified a half-dozen Hertz Rental Car customers who claim this happened to them.

Tips/Resources:
It’s worth checking for cases in your market. The attorney we interviewed cites cases in
Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Kentucky, Texas, and Indiana.

Sports Memorabilia - An estimated 60-70% of of sports memorabilia is fraudulent. We bought
some items from a local sports memorabilia store accused of selling fraudulent items. We took
those items to authenticator Kevin Keating with PSA, a company the FBI has used during
investigations into the industry.
Tips/Resources:
https://kevinkeatingbooks.com/meet-the-author/ - He’s based in Virginia
Our story:
https://6abc.com/business/local-company-accused-of-selling-phony-sportsmemorabilia/4729423/
Uber/Lyft Safety - The proliferation of ride-sharing services has some parents using Uber and
Lyft to taxi their children around, however, it's against the policy of both companies and can
prove to be unsafe. We interviewed a local mother who says an Uber driver abducted her
daughter and the driver continued to work for the company for months even after he was
charged.
Tips/Resources
-We had a 14-year-old sign up on both apps with parental permission.. Then we had him call
Uber/Lyft drivers from various locations
-We monitored his travels on the app..
-Three times he was able to get an Uber driver to pick him up with no questions asked. A Lyft
driver did the same.
