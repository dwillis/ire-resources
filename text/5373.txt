Panel Description
You understand how you processed your data. Does your editor? Your reader? You, in six
months? Without a replicable approach to extracting, transforming and loading data, we are
often frustrated in our efforts to share or update our work. Join us for a panel discussion of
reproducible data workflows. We’ll talk about why we use standardized processes for collecting,
cleaning and analyzing data, and share practices that work for us. We’ll also discuss strategies
for smart human intervention (i.e. reporting, logging and documentation) in automated
workflows.
