The USA TODAY Diversity Index was invented
in 1991 by Philip Meyer of the University of North Carolina
and Shawn McIntosh of USA TODAY.

This graphic, published when the first wave of Census 2010 data
emerged in March 2011, showed the index on several scales.

The USA’s diversity has been rising sharply.

A searchable interactive, embedded in many participating newsrooms’ coverage,
showed any county’s trajectory compared to that of its state.
A “farthest-neighbor” function retrieved the most distant counties
with the same index, prompting users to think nationally.

Enrollment data collected by the National Center for Educational Statistics
allowed users to discover the diversity index across 20 years for almost 100,000 public schools.

One installment in the package focused on high levels of diversity
in the Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., using the diversity index
at census tract (neighborhood) level.
Also shown: native countries of students from one elementary school in Alexandria, Va.

Many of Gannett’s TV stations did local reports using the data,

including KARE in Minneapolis (shown), WUSA in Washington, D.C.,
and KUSA in Denver.
Several Gannett newsrooms built custom interactives
to map diversity data at the census tract (neighborhood) level,
including The Journal-News in New York.

Contributions to the project took many forms. A staff artist
at The Journal-News in New York created an animation to explain the index.

10

Many newsrooms created detailed maps with the data,
including the Des Moines Register and the Cincinnati Enquirer.

In 2015, the Vancouver Sun adaped the USA TODAY Diversity Index
to Canada’s racial statistics system to examine diversity trends
at the neighborhood level in Vancouver, British Columbia.

The index can be adapted to measure diversity in
many areas of local news coverage.
