Tip Sheet - The most significant problems in the life insurance industry occur in its marketplaces, during the sales
process when annuities, life, disability, and LTCI get sold. To document such problems, one needs to get into the
marketplace, to do more than the WSJ's 1997 book, Lifetime Guide to Money, which regarding life insurance states,
"There are lots of problems in the way it is sold." Find out how transactions/sales actually occur, what gets said.
Inadequate disclosures of financial products prevent consumers from learning about aspects of the product to which they
might have serious objections. Potentially, there can be serious objections to every aspect of a product, and there in fact
often are valid bases for multiple objections. Broadly speaking about life insurance, consumers need to be provided with
Truth-in-Life Insurance. Very briefly, consumers have always needed and deserved to be informed of the annual costs of
the handful of a policy's basic operating components: sales, administrative, premium taxes, claims, and capital charges.
For policies with investment components, consumers need information about such and their tax privileges' impacts.
Be aware: Different types of misrepresentations are made depending upon the seller's objectives (type of policy, .i.e.,
whole life vs. UL-GNL vs. Equity Indexed UL vs. 30 Yr Level Premium Term) and the buyers' situations ("knowledge"
preferences, etc.) Regarding buyers' "knowledge" please research Americans' financial, risk, and insurance literacy.
Readers and viewers need financial and risk-management education. The life insurance industry is a goldmine for an
investigative journalist who has done the necessary research. The learning will fascinate both journalist and audience. It is
vital that any journalist or journalist team covering the life insurance industry have (or develop) strong mathematical and
financial knowledge and insightful understanding (preferably extensive experience) of business transactions, that is, sales.
