Use Tor Browser!
Download: ​https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en
● Allows users to browse the Web while leaving a misleading metadata trail.
○ Normally your IP address will connect directly to a website, and the connection
may or may not be encrypted. Tor browser routes your connection through three
servers around the world before connecting you to the destination website, so
you will appear to connect from a remote location.
○ You should avoid putting personally identifying information into Tor Browser.
○ If you are trying to connect in a region that blocks Tor traffic, launch the
browser, and click ‘Open Settings’ -> ‘Configure’ -> ‘Yes’ -> ‘obfs4’ ->
‘Continue’ -> ‘No’. This will allow you to disguise your traffic and bypass the
block.
○ If your connection to the website was encrypted going in (e.g., with an HTTPS
connection) it’s encrypted when it leaves the Tor network too. If it’s unencrypted
in (HTTP) going into the network, it’s also unencrypted leaving the network.

Want to log into websites safely?
First, stop using the same password across multiple websites. It seems that recently we see a
new, massive dump of passwords every week. When one website gets hacked, hackers will use
the passwords from one website on other websites to see if they can get into users’ accounts.
This is why it’s important that you do not reuse the same passwords. Simultaneously, we reuse
passwords because it’s difficult to remember them. Password managers can help us solve this
problem. Two-factor authentication adds another layer of security, requiring access to device
before anyone can log into your account.
Use password managers
With password managers, you only need to remember one password in order to access your
password vault, which stores your other long, randomly-generated passwords. Password
managers can also help you to automatically fill passwords in your browser, which will save you
a lot of time.

For a simple free and open source alternative, consider Padlock: ​https://padlock.io
○
For now, Padlock only works on Chrome + iOS / Android.

If a hacker manages to get your password on one account, but you’ve randomized and stored
each unique password with a password manager, you can isolate a breach while still getting
easy access to all of your accounts.
Use two-factor authentication (2FA)
Two-factor authentication refers to generating a temporary, second “password” (a second
factor) before logging in. This password is typically sent through an SMS text message or a
mobile app.
You should add two-factor authentication everywhere, but in particular, your email. If your email
is compromised, your other accounts can be easily stolen as well. If a hacker steals your
password and you have 2FA installed, they are most likely locked out of your account.
First, go here: ​http://twofactorauth.org/
Look into services that you want to secure with two-factor authentication. You can add 2-factor
authentication with SMS or an app. An app is generally recommended, because SMS can be
more easily intercepted by third parties.
● Google Authenticator.​ Download for iPhone
(​https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8​) or Android
(​https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2​)
● Authy. Download for iPhone (​https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/authy/id494168017?mt=8​)
or Android (​https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en​)

Want to protect your personal data? Use disk encryption
If you lose, or if someone takes your unsecured device, it’s easy to access your files or copy
your disk drive and read the files. Luckily, it’s also pretty easy to encrypt devices so that no
one can read them except us.
● If you own a newer iPhone and have a passcode, there’s a good chance your phone is
already encrypted. Read more: ​https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202064
● You can also learn how to encrypt your Android device:
https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/2844831
● If you use Mac OS X, you can encrypt your drive using FileVault:
https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837
● If you use Windows, some versions allow you to encrypt your drive with BitLocker:
http://www.pcworld.com/article/2308725/encryption/a-beginners-guide-to-bitlocker-wi
ndows-built-in-encryption-tool.html
● For most Linux distributions, users must set up disk encryption when installing their OS.

Encrypt your files over the cloud
If you want to protect your data stored on remote cloud services, Google Drive and Dropbox
are very easy to use, but can be decrypted by the company. For your sensitive data, it’s
generally wise to encrypt your data so the service provider can’t read it.
● For “zero knowledge” encrypted services that allow you to sync cloud data on
convenient
mobile
and
desktop
applications,
consider
SpiderOak
(​http://spideroak.com​) or Tresorit (​http://tresorit.com​). Each service offers a range of
payment plans for your personal or organization’s needs.
● Cryptomator (​https://cryptomator.org/​) can help you encrypt files on other cloud
services (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox). Cryptomator has a “pay what you want” model.

Want to talk to colleagues and sources securely?
Want to talk securely over desktop, or concerned about metadata? Use Ricochet!
Download: ​https://ricochet.im/
● Assigns a random chat ID per install (e.g. ricochet:vlsh4iw4n5ga5des)
○ If you have ricochet on two computers, ​you’ll have two different chat IDs
○ Give someone your ricochet:id and they can add you
○ You can give IDs local nicknames so you know whose it is
● Uses Tor
○ You don’t have to install Tor separately
○ On setup, when it asks what connection type you want, hit “Just use connect.”
Need mobile text messaging, video and voice calls? Use Signal!
Download: ​https://whispersystems.org/​ (click link to Apple or Android store)
● Drop-in replacement for phone calls and text messages.
● Uses contact list from your phone to find other users.
● Verification on voice call:
○ Two words shown: you read one to your partner, they read the other to you.
○ If their two words don't match yours, the connection is not secure.
Want to get started with Signal? Take a look at this guide on Signal for beginners by Martin
Shelton (@mshelton): ​https://medium.com/@mshelton/signal-for-beginners-c6b44f76a1f0
Want to make secure video or voice calls? Use Jitsi Meet!
Go to ​https://meet.jit.si/
● Jitsi Meet runs in your browser. It’s essentially Google Hangouts, minus data mining.

Want to learn more about encrypted communications?
There are a couple of options. If you want to use Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) email encryption…
Desktop Email with PGP: Use Thunderbird (+ Enigmail + GPG)
Detailed instructions (required reading): ​https://securityinabox.org/en/thunderbird_main

Use PGP without email integration
Getting started guide from Matt Mitchell (@geminiimatt):
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zn62XjVRkt6_nvtgUvWO4WLo4VTQ3WQ98WKc5gkPb
8w/edit
Alternatively, use ProtonMail for straightforward encrypted email
● Email is only encrypted between ProtonMail users.
● You must use another tool (e.g. GPG) to secure messages to and from non-protonmail
addresses.
● ProtonMail offers Android app, iOS app, and a browser app.

Important terms
●
●
●
●

●
●

“Cleartext” / “plaintext”: An unencrypted, human-readable message.
Encrypt: Scramble a message so it can't be read.
Decrypt: Reverse the encryption process to make an encrypted message readable.
Verification (sometimes referred to as "authenticating"): Ensuring that the person you’re
speaking with is the person you think they are. More about this important process:
https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/help/authenticate.php
Logging: Saving chat conversations on your device.
"End-to-end" encryption: Most web services (e.g., Skype) are designed to allow the
service to unscramble the message. An end-to-end encrypted conversation means that
the encryption is designed so that no one except the intended conversational
participants can unscramble the message.

PGP/2-key encryption terms
● Pretty Good Privacy (PGP): An email encryption tool from the early 1990s. PGP is the
inspiration for GPG.
● Gnu Privacy Guard (GPG): Free and open source version of PGP. GPG is now widely
used (not PGP). The terms​ ​“PGP” and “GPG” are often used interchangeably.
● Public key cryptography: Encryption using one key to encrypt, and another to decrypt.
● Public key: The key used to “lock” (encrypt) a message. Give your public key to people
so they can encrypt messages to you.
● Private (or “secret”) key: The key used to unlock (decrypt) a message. You want to keep
your private key to yourself, so no one else can decrypt messages meant for you.
● Message signing: Signing allows other users to confirm that a message, in fact, came
from you. Signing a message means generating a cryptographic code that corresponds
to the combination of your private key and the message. Other PGP users can verify
that
a
signed message came from the right source. More info:
