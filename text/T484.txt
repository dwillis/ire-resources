Was the Great Flood Likely?

Bible says "all the high hills that were under the whole
heaven were covered.''
Let's assume highest peak around was 5,000 feet
Rain: 40 days and 40 nights
= 960 hours
Rate: 2-3 inches per hour now considered heavy rain
So let's assume 1 foot/hour
Amount: 960 feet, not accounting for any runoff
How hard would it have had to rain?
5,000 feet divided by 960 hours = 5.21 feet per hour, not
accounting for any runoff

Percents
A standardized way of expressing a fraction, where the
denominator (the bottom number) equals 100.
So 114 is 25 percent, 113 is 33 percent, etc.
Percent Change
Percent Change = "change" 1 "old"
1996 budget = $500,000
1997 budget = $600,000
"Change" = $100,000
Percent increase = $100,000 1 $500,000 = 0.2 = 20 pe ent
Choosing a different reference point can alter the outcome
What percent of spending in 1997 is "new" spending?
New = $1OO,OOO/$6OO,OOO = 0.1666... = 16.7 percent
General boundaries on percentage change to check your work
Percentage change can be negative:
1996 budget =$500,000
1997 budget = $400,000
Change = -$100,000
Percent change = -$lOO,OOO/$5OO,OOO = -0.2 = minus 20 percent
(we frequently say something declined by 20 percent)

Note that if the budget were cut by $100,000 this year and restored
next year, that would be a 20 percent, followed by a 25 percent
increase. Lesson: You can't just add percentages to compute an
overall percentage change.
In general, quantities cannot decline by more than 100 percent,
because there's nothing left. However, there is no upper limit on
how much something can increase, in percentage terms:
Michael Jordan's 1986 salary: $1 million
Michael Jordan's 1996 salary: $8 million
Change: $7 million
Percent change: $7,000,000/$1,000,000 = 7 = 700 percent
Percentage points
Usefbl when comparing two numbers already expressed as
percentages.
March unemployment = 5 percent
April unemployment = 6 percent
Change: 1 percentage point
Percent change = 1 (the change) divided by 5 (the old) = 20
percent

Compound percentages
School district signs a contract giving teachers 8 percent raises in
each of the next three years. What's the percentage increase in the
contract?
Note that the percent increase is applied to a bigger base each year.
Assume the average teacher made $30,000 under the old contract.
First year: $30,000 * 0.08 = $2,400 so new salary is $32,400.
Second year: $32,400 * 0.08 = $2,592 so new salary is $34,992.
Third year: $34,992 * 0.08 = $2,799 so new salary is $37,791.
Total percent change:
$37,991 - $30,000 = $7,991 (change) 1 $30,000 (old) = 0.2597 =
25.97 percent

Mean vs median
Mean is arithmetic average taught in grade school. Add up the
values and divide by the number of values
Median is the middle value in a group, where the values have been
ranked from top to bottom. (If there are an even number of
members in the group, the median is the average of the middle
two.)
How they can differ:
Assume there are 100 workers at a company, and 95 make $30,000
a year, while 5 make $300,000 a year.
Mean = ((95 * 30,000) + (5 * 300,000)) I 100 = $4,350,000 I 100 =
$43,500
Median: $30,000 (the average of the 50th and 5 1st highest salaries)
Which is more reflective?
What if there are 20 students in a class and 10 score 40 on a test
and 10 score 100. The mean score is 70. The median score is 70
(the average of the 10th and 11th highest scores). Which tells you
more about the students in that class?

Context
From the pages of the Mercury News:
"More than 125 million American households have dogs or cats,
and 65 million pets will become permanently disabled at one point
in their lives."
"Allen Ginsberg, poet laureate of the Beat Movement, has
accumulated enough stuff during his life to fill 750 bookshelves -about as much as all 14,000 titles on the fiction shelves of Palo
Alto's main library branch. "
"California led all states, with 3,379 more (unemployment)
claims.''
"Gary Grabert, who began selling products fiom the Hidden
Camera Store on-line six months ago, said he receives more
inquiries fiom California than any other state."

ADJUSTING FOR ~NFLATION
It's the thing that everyone knows is the right thing to do. But many media
outlets often mislead because they do not adjust data to reflect the impact of
inflation. Charts and stories still can refer to the unadjusted data. They also
should show the adjusted numbers.
If beginning teachers started out a t $12,000 a year in 1975 and 20 years later
were making $34,000 a year we could stir up readers by talking about how
teacher salaries have skyrocketed so much that they've nearly tripled in the
last 20 years. However, if we adjust the $12,000 for inflation, the $12,000 in
1995 dollars would be $33,996 - far from skyrocketing.

How do you present both adjusted and not adjusted numbers? The chart
above accurately and dramatically shows how fast the teacher salaries
increased over time - and how inflation affected those increases.
Adjust everything. Even if you don't use the data, it will help you to visualize
the "true" peaks and valleys in salaries, government funding, etc.
Unadjusted dollars have several names, including current dollars and
nominal dollars. Adjusted dollars also are called real or constant.

The Consumer Price Index (All-Urban), reported monthly by the Bureau of
Labor Statistics1U.S. Department of Labor, is used to adjust data. You can
get updated CPI numbers on the Internet at: http:~hnmn.b~s.gov.
(click on data, click on most requested series, click on consumer price indedall urban)

The CPI is an index. Prices were set a t a "base" of 100 between 1983-84. The
index ranges from 9.8 in January, 1913 to 156.3 in April, 1996. This means
that, over this period of time, prices as measured by the Consumer Price
156.3
Index, have increased by a factor of nearly 16. (= 15.95). Thus, if
9.8
burnished flywheels sold for $2 each in 1913, they would be expected to sell
for $32 each in 1996 if they had exuctly kept pace with inflation, as measured
by the Consumer Price Index.
It is important to note in a story or graphic somewhere that you are using the
CPI as your adjustment method. There are other indexes, but the CPI is the
most-widely used. Keep in mind that the CPI measures inflation among
consumers (and a very average consumer a t that). If you're trying to tell
whether the budget of a city is going up suspiciously fast, you're applying a
consumer marketbasket to the city's purchases. Most consumers don't pick
up asphalt, gravel or bulldozers on a trip to the market. There are other
indexes, but in general most will show the same results as the CPI.
To adjust for inflation, select the "base" year and divide the index for the year
in question into that base year. In our example above, the base year is 1995
(it is adjusted in "1995 dollars"). And the year in question
is 1975. So the
152.4
base year index divided by the 1975 index is -- 2.833.
53.8
The attached sheets have the annual average (and December-to-December)
multipliers already calculated. For example, if the town budget were
$1,394,245 in 1990, what would it be in 1995 dollars?
First, the math-and-calculator approach:
152.4
- 1.166. This is the multiplier.
130.7

--

1.166 x $1,394,245 = $1,625,690.

Now, using the sheets:
First find the earlier year, which is 1990 in this example. Draw your finger
across the 1990 line to the Ann. Avg. Mult. Column. The multiplier is 1.166.
Multiply that by your 1990 budget total.

What if the earlier year were 1970? Go to the 1970 line to the Ann. Avg.
Mult. Column. The multiplier is 3.928. Multiply that by the 1970 budget
and you have it in 1995 inflation-adjusted dollars.
Should you always use the annual average index number? Generally, yes.
If you can pin spending or a dollar amount down to one month, you could use
that number. If a certain amount of money is spent every April, you might
want to then use the April number for adjusting each year. But city budgets,
salaries, etc. are paid out over the course of a year.
Some people prefer the December-to-December number. Keep in mind that
when you use a one-month index number you are focusing on any statistical
error or other anomalies that occurred in collecting that month's data. When
you use an annual average, the impact of a problem from a single month of
data is spread out over 12 months.
In adjusting, you can go the other way, too. Going back in time you use the
reciprocal of the multiplier. For example, a worker paid $40,000 a year in
1995 would have been paid what in 1920? The index for 1995, again, is 152.4
and the index for 1920 is 20 (really).
152.4
-- 7.62

1
Reciprocal: -- 0.131 0.131 x 40,000 = $5,240.
20.0
7.62
The $40,000 salary in 1995, then, is comparable to a salary of $5,240 in 1920
when adjusted for inflation.

You're looking a t a municipal budget that was $25,000,000 in
1980 and $41,000,000 in 1990.
The overall change is 64%. You can divide 64% by 10 years and
come up with an average of 6.4% a year. Many reporters, then,
would want to write that the "budget increased by an average of
6.4 percent a year ...." But that would be wrong.
This reporter has ignored the effects of compounding.
Divide $41,000,000 by $25,000,000. You come up with 1.64. Now
go to the 10 years row in the table and find the number that
comes closest to 1.64.
Annual Percentage Rate
Period (Years) 0.01 0.015 0.02 0.025 0.03 0.035 0.04 0.045 0.05 0.055 0.06
1 1.010 1.015 1.020 1.025 1.030 1.035 1.040 1.045 1.050 1.055 1.060

You discover that the number that comes closest is 1.629 in the
0.05 column. Now you can say with accuracy that "over the 10year period, the budget increased by about five percent a year."
(In general, it is fine to round percentages off with no decimal
points. Decimals actually serve to confuse the reader and suggest
a degree of accuracy that just is not there.)

The Effects of
Compounding:

Optional: The Math Behind Growth Rates
r = growth rate
t = time (usually in years)
Now = The value today (i.e. "this year's budget")
Then = The value a t the beginning (i.e. "the budget then")

From our example above: A budget of $41,000,000 in 1990 (NOW) and a
budget of $25,000,000 in 1980 (THEN). A total of 10 years (t). (The 10 in the
radical sign below means you need to calculate the 10th root of the number.)

If you're doing this on a spreadsheet - let's say an MS Excel sheet - here's
the formula:

The "^" sign is Shiftl6. The "=" sign tells Excel a formula is coming (just as
the "+" does the same in Quattro or Lotus). Using the example above:
=((41/25)"(1/10)) -1

The answer in the spreadsheet cell will be 0.050714.

What Compound Growth Rates Don't Show

Generally, teacher salaries and similar numbers show consistent
growth. At least they tend not to go down.
However, many numbers do fluctuate - some of them wildly.
Keep in mind that when you calculate a compound annual growth
rate you are showing the trend, but based only on two numbers
(the NOW and the THEN).

The two main columns in this table are ( I ) the D to D Mult. and (2) the Ann. Avg. Mult.
The first is the multiplier to adjust data using the December-to-December average for the CPI.
The second is the multiplier to adjust data using the Annual Average for the CPI.
Which to use? I favor the Annual Average (which is about equal to the June or July CPI number). A budget is spent over the
course of a year, not at year's end (December).

1lThe formula is simple. The index for 1995 (152.4) divided by the index for the year in question. If you're looking at a 1985
I budget: 152.41107.6 = 1Al6. If the budget were $12 million in 1985 and $17 million in 1995, did it increase? Let's adjust the
1985 amount: 12,000,000 X 1.4 16 = $16,992,000. In "real" or "inflation-adjusted"terms, the budget showed no increase.
.What if we want the 1995 budget in 1985 dollars (not advised in most cases; use the most-recent year as your base period):
]Find the reciprocal of the multiplier. 111A16 X 17,000,000 = 12,005,650.
