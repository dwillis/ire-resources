No interview, no problem. From the FBI to a suspected serial killer, here are tips on how to convince
the most difficult subjects to talk.

VICTIMS AND WHISTLEBLOWERS –

•

Find Motive: Everyone has a motive or reason to want to speak; ego, anger, revenge, the desire to
help others, etc. Figure out what your subject’s motive is and tap into it.
Show Compassion: We’re all passionate about our stories and therefore, we care about the people
affected. Make sure you convey how much you care; put yourself in their shoes.
Move Fast: If you give someone too much time to think, you may lose that person. Be prepared to
move fast to get your subject on camera.
Face‐To‐Face: What you say and how you say it matters, so does how you carry yourself. Be aware
of your body language; the more open you are, the more comfortable your subject will feel.
Make No Promises: Be up‐front. You’re offering your subject a platform to speak out, nothing more.

GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS –

Transparency: Tell the subjects of your story what it’s about and why going on camera is critical to
presenting a balanced report. They may not like the subject, but will respect your candor.
Accountability: A written statement is never as strong as an on‐camera interview. This is their
opportunity to address a controversial issue that would not be possible without an interview.
Backgrounding: Subjects should be able to check you out through LinkedIn or other social media.
Send them links to stories you’ve done that show how going on camera would be beneficial.
Patience: If you can’t get the top official to talk, ask about who knows the subject best to respond
to the allegations. That person may turn out to be a better fit for the story.
Persistence: Government agencies will try to wear you down. It may take months to get that on‐
camera interview, but it will be worth it.

CENTRAL CHARACTERS –

•

Ask First. Chase Later: Make them understand immunity is not an option.
Strip Away Excuses: Great salespeople do this all the time to get a commitment from a hesitant
buyer. Listen to the reason behind their ‘no’ and then offer to alleviate that concern.
Apply Pressure: Convince their family and friends that it’s in the main characters’ best interests to
explain, add to, participate.
Arrange The Interview Setting To Maximize Opportunity: Plan location. Use surveillance to
understand daily patterns. If you think the person might try to avoid your camera, make sure you
first approach them in the open. Cold door knocks are a last resort. Knock, back away, make them
decide to hide or come out into the open.
Create An Interaction: For approach TV interviews, the reporter and character need to be together
in a medium shot. Your questions and their non‐reaction might be the best sound you get.
