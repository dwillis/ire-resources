Scope of the problem? Many states have “opioid dashboards” calling out overdoses, deaths,
prescriptions, by geographical region. Centers for Disease Control has detail and big picture.

What kind of treatment is offered in your state? Most treatment in the U.S. is still AA-based,
12-step peer support. Research has shown that medication-assisted treatment is more
successful at keeping people off drugs and helping them get lives, but it’s controversial (“same
addict, new drug”).

Does your state run its own health insurance exchange under the Affordable Care Act?
 Get special enrollment data – i.e., sign-ups that occur outside the regular enrollment
period. Can be gamed.
 Complaints and enforcement actions from state Department of Insurance can help identify
scams.
 Federal marketplace special enrollment – https://www.healthcare.gov/
What happens to the children of users?
 Dependency court case openings and closings by county through the years are available from
the Judicial Council of California. How does your county stack up against others? How has it
performed over time?
 Federal data from US Department of Health and Human Services’ Children’s Bureau. There is
SO MUCH here it can take weeks to pore through. National reports summarize state and
county data – but the source data is available from your county, and reporters can ask for it.
 AFCARS is the federal Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System, which
collects information on children in foster care and those who have been adopted.
 NCANDS is the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System, a voluntary data collection
system that gathers information from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico
about reports of child abuse and neglect.
 California no longer has a statewide Child Death Review Team, but many individual counties
do. If yours does, get the reports going back several years and take a look at what’s
happening.
 Get more detail about deaths and injuries of kids in your county. In California, ask county
Social Services for SOC 826 and SOC 826A forms. Then double back with your county
coroner for detail.

 Take advantage of those IRE tip sheets! Search “opioid” on ire.org and you’ll get some
great stuff.
 There are many more links to data sites in the Powerpoint, which will be available on
ire.org as well.
