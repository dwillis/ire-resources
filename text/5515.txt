Tip 2: Spending is always more interesting

Payment was marked as “contract labor” = “paid interview”
This was for a PAC called Committee to Restore America’s Greatness

Tip 3: Know your LLCs
This goes for both contributions (super PACs) and spending.
With super PACs, this is where you’ll see some attempts to mask the
source of contributions, though there are easier ways to conceal dark
money.

Examples:
TMCV #2 LLC
NG Montana LLC
IGX LLC

Tip 3: Know your LLCs
Tracing LLCs back to owners (or as far as you can)
_ Look up addresses and pull local records
(County recorders and assessors are your friends)
_ Check for other donations
_ State corporation registries (Secretaries of State)
_ OpenCorporates

_ Nexis

Tip 3: Know your LLCs
On the spending side, this also can be revealing:
_ Green Monster LLC = Corey Lewandowski
_ Bade LLC = Rick Gates (Later came up in federal indictment)
_ Jamestown Associates = Jason Miller

Tip 3: Know your LLCs
And show who’s getting rich off the campaign.
