Criminal records in Colombia
Sometimes translation doesn’t really work as we expect.
In this example, the literal translations of “criminal records” and
“court” don’t work because Colombians use other words (Latin
America follows the Roman legal system)

Then what?
You have to do research on how the countries work in the high
level. For example:
Google
JUDICIARY OF COLOMBIA
