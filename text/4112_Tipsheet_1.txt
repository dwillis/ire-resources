Local/regional story ideas using FRED®
1. Take a look at local unemployment:
• Track the Phoenix metro area unemployment rate in a chart or in Microsoft Excel*:
http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=jvG
• Compare the Phoenix rate to the national rate:
http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=jvH
• You can also do this for counties**. See the Maricopa County unemployment rate:
http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=jvX
2. Look at county-level population to find trends over time; for example, compare Maricopa
County with Pima County: http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=jAQ
3. For a story on how the local housing market is recovering:
• See New Private Housing Units Authorized by Building Permit for Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale,
AZ (MSA): http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=jzv
• See the Phoenix MSA’s home price index: http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=jvN
• Look at statewide numbers for building permits:
http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=jvp
• Look at statewide numbers for construction employment:
http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=jAY
4. You can see how many people are working in individual sectors in the Phoenix area to identify
areas of growth or decline: Educational and Health Services; Financial Activities; Government;
Information; Leisure and Hospitality; Manufacturing; Other Services; Professional and Business
Services; and Trade, Transportation and Utilities.
• Compare all of them in a chart or Excel: http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=jzx
• You could also see how a sector’s percentage share of total employment has changed. For
example, you could find out how the Education and Health Services sector’s share of total
nonfarm employment has changed: http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=jzD***
5. Take a look at Arizona’s economic growth:
• Use the state’s real GDP: http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=jvs
• Compare to other states by combining in the same chart:
http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=jvt (For either the individual state or
comparing multiple states, you could select “Percent change” in the drop-down menu under
“Units” to show percentage change from one year to the next.)
6. For stories about changes in health care laws, to look at where the U.S. stands now, see Health
Insurance Coverage Rate: http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=jzz
7. For a story about the decline (or increase) in tourism dollars flowing in from visits to the Grand
Canyon, you want numbers to show Americans’ spending on vacations:
• Real Disposable Personal Income: http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=jvw
• U.S. Gas Prices: http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=jzB

8. For a story about a potential major commercial development and the ambiguity surrounding
when the developer will break ground, look at how retail and food services sales are performing:
Real Retail and Food Services Sales: http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=jvx
9. For a story about how families are feeling about their financial stability in the midst of our
economic recovery, for national context, look at the Personal Saving Rate:
http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=jB4
10. For a look at where the Arizona state government stands in a fiscal sense, you could check out
several indicators:
• Overall state tax collections: http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=jvP
• State corporation net income taxes collections:
http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=jvR
• State individual income tax collections: http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=jB0
