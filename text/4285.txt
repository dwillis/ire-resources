Data used for Shadow Campus series on student overcrowding:
● Enrollment/housing data on US colleges from the Department of Education’s IPEDS
database.
● Allowed us to see whether colleges were adding housing units as fast as they were
adding students (most were not). We got assistance in pulling the data from the
National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)
● Property assessment data for the city of Boston for 10 years (allowed us to see how owner
occupancy was changing around college campuses)
● Electronic log of housing complaints filed with the city from Boston Inspectional Services
Division (obtained through public records request)
● List of housing court cases brought against landlords in student neighborhoods; obtained
through a combination of court records and city records.
● Log of 911/police calls from the Boston Police Department
● Log of 911/fire calls from Boston Fire Department
● Database of citations issued by the city to landlords from the Boston Inspectional Services
department
● US Census data (allowed us to identify areas with highest student-age population)
● Complaints to city filed through 311 line (Mayor’s Hotline)
● Survey of 266 students who lived off-campus. (Conducted in person by
intern/correspondents going door to door with survey on iPads and uploaded to
quicktapsurvey.com.).
● Reports filed by private colleges on student enrolment with City of Boston (Each college
filed a spreadsheet showing how many students they had and where students lived off
campus). We supplemented that by collecting data directly from public colleges.
Other types of data:
● Vendor payments for public colleges
● Payroll database for public colleges

● Selected fields from IRS tax filings

schools are generally not required to pay property taxes)
