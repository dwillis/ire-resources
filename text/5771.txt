Teaching the computer to identify patients’ deaths...

...to ﬁnd cases in which the events were misclassiﬁed

The data can have its own challenges
FDA’s Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database

Duplicates
Dirty

Diﬀerent ways of
presenting device names
and manufacturers

Some approaches:
● We looked for unique identifiers and product codes
● We gathered more than 40,000 manufacturer’s subsidiaries to explore events
linked to specific devices and/or manufacturers

Underreporting

Data source: MAUDE (FDA)
Death reports (2013-2017): nearly 64,000
Number of reports (2008-2017): +5.4 million

2,100 cases in the last five years in which device patients had died,
but their deaths had been classified as a “malfunction” or “injury.”
(2013-2017)

220 reports indicated that devices may have caused or contributed to the deaths.

An initial set of phrases from expert + reporter

Classification: Malfunction
Description: “It was reported that the patient expired”

“Patient expired”

...based on real death reports in the data

“The patient had a dead battery”

“He noted that his father passed away”

Beware of false positives!
