Background like a boss
Cody Winchester, IRE/NICAR
@cody_winchester

General approach
● Become a student of your subject’s life (be nosy and curious)
● Anything you find online is just a lead -- might be true, might not -- that must
be verified with primary-source reporting
● You will sift through a lot of hay to find your needles

General approach
● Determine scope and deadline
○
○

How much time do you have? Is this a two-day turn or a two-month investigation?
Is your subject a public official? A company that does lots of business with the government? A
random person on the street?

● Every person and institution you include in your story needs a basic scrub, but
not everyone needs the $12 wash and wax

Make it a habit
● Background yourself to test website accuracy
● Background relatives, dates, babysitters, neighbors
● Develop a set of newsroom protocols (checklists are good)

Keep in mind
● There is no “magic” website that will give you all the goods for $19.99, sorry
● People aren’t that creative
● Extensive backgrounding is key for one-shot interviews

Keep in mind
● Good backgrounding can lead to a story
● Back up online sleuthing with shoe-leather reporting -- verify and extend what
you find online
● Always ask: “Is there anything in your background I need to know about?”

When you’re searching
● Use bits of information as keys to unlock new data (e.g., DOB)
● Expand your search to family, business partners
● Tip: Log dates/facts/sources/notes in a spreadsheet -- instant timeline!

Think through your subject’s life
● 911 calls: They get the cops/fire/ambulance called to their homes and
businesses
● Property/tax records: They buy and sell property
● Obituaries: They have siblings and other relatives listed in family obits
● Wedding registries: They get engaged
● Wedding license records: They actually get married

Think through your subject’s life
● Crowdfunding campaigns: They ask the Internet for money
● Social media accounts: They are social on the Internet
● Corporate and UCC filings: They own or have a stake in a business, or they
are party to a transaction that typically involves buying goods on credit

“What is the Uniform Commercial Code?” (“A law governing commercial transactions, sales and
leasing of goods, transfer of funds, commercial paper, bills of lading, secured transactions, etc.”
-- Colorado SOS)

Think through your subject’s life
● Court filings: They sue, get sued, are charged with crimes, get divorced, go
bankrupt
○

County and district courts
Federal/bankruptcy courts
U.S. Tax Court
Divorce files are a (sad) gold mine of information
Court files can yield key bits of data, e.g. DOB

● Tax liens: They owe money to the government

Think through your subject’s life
● Military records: They served or are serving in a branch of the military
○

Check enrollment in local property tax deferral programs for members of the military, too

● DMV records: They have a license to drive, they get tickets, they own one or
more cars
○
○

Every state has different laws about what information is available
Colorado DMV: “Privacy laws prevent us from providing you with a driving record (other than
your own) without that person's permission.”

● Patents and trademarks: They invent things or have ideas

Think through your subject’s life
● Campaign finance: They give money to candidate committees, PACs, etc.
● They vote
○
○

$50 for a copy of the statewide voter file
Denver gives its voter data away

● Fines/administrative orders/consent decrees: They are part of a regulated
industry and get in trouble with that regulator

Think through your subject’s life
● Clips: They were mentioned in a story by your news organization
● Professional licensing records: They are licensed to do some occupation
(check for discipline records with the licensure board, too)
● Government contracts: They do business with the government

Tapping the power of Google
● The basics (h/t):

○
○
○
○

Full name (in and out of quotes) plus organization
Full name (in and out of quotes) and city/state
Last name and organization
Full name in quotes + “mugshot”
Always go a few pages in

Tapping the power of Google
