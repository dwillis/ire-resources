Question 8. Section 106(b)(2)(B)(x) of CAPTA requires states to provide for the
public disclosure of findings or information about a case of child abuse or neglect
which results in a child fatality or near fatality. Under this provision, is there
information that a state must disclose to the public?

Answer
Yes. States must develop procedures for the release of information including, but
not limited to: the cause of and circumstances regarding the fatality or near
fatality; the age and gender of the child; information describing any previous
reports or child abuse or neglect investigations that are pertinent to the child
abuse or neglect that led to the fatality or near fatality; the result of any such
investigations; and the services provided by and actions of the State on behalf of
the child that are pertinent to the child abuse or neglect that led to the fatality or
near fatality.
