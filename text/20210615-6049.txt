It depends… and it could involve a lot of angles.

Government -- federal, state and local
Law enforcement -- federal, state, and local
Data on attacks

What’s domestic terrorism?
Federal criminal law deﬁnition:
●
●

●

“acts dangerous to human life that are a
violation of the criminal laws …”
appear to be intended—
○ (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian
population;
○ (ii) to inﬂuence the policy of a
government by intimidation or
coercion; or
○ (iii) to aﬀect the conduct of a
government by mass destruction,
assassination, or kidnapping; and
occur primarily in the U.S.

International terrorism deﬁnition:
●
●

The same, except it happens outside
the U.S.
Acts “occur primarily outside the
territorial jurisdiction of the United
States, or transcend national
boundaries.”

What’s domestic terrorism?
FBI’s deﬁnition:
●

●

“Domestic terrorists are individuals who commit violent criminal acts in furtherance of
ideological goals stemming from domestic inﬂuences, such as racial bias and anti-government
sentiment.”
“International terrorism includes cases in which subjects are members of designated FTOs
[foreign terrorist organizations], state sponsors of terrorism, and [homegrown violent
extremists]. The latter are individuals inside the United States who are inspired by international
terrorism who have been radicalized to violence primarily in the United States, and who are not
receiving individualized direction from FTOs.”
(Source: congressional testimony)

It can be from the right or left, motivated by variety of ideologies
- Motivations:

Racial
Political
Anti-government
Environmental
etc.

In recent years...
●

Vast majority of violent attacks and
killings were perpetrated by those with
far-right ideologies, such as white
supremacists.
○ 2019 El Paso Walmart shooter
targeted Latinos
○ 2018 Pittsburgh synagogue
shooter targeted Jews

Rising threat
●

●
●
●

Attacks + plots are at highest levels in
more than 25 years (CSIS)
Elevated threat from white supremacists,
militia extremists (U.S. intelligence)
From 2014-20, there were more than 60 terrorist attacks
annually in the U.S., which include shootings, assaults
and bombs, a trend not seen since the early 1980s
(START at the University of Maryland)
People with far-right ideology were responsible for the
largest share of these attacks. (START).
FBI also says it’s investigating more cases.
(Chart to right come from this WSJ story from Sept.
2020.)

U.S. challenges
Inherently political and thorny

Lawmakers may exaggerate threats or focus on political foes. Ideologies espoused by violent
extremists may overlap with mainstream views.

No statute
No broad charge for domestic terrorism. May be easier to bring charges against someone inspired
by ISIS than white supremacy.

Not a crime to be a member of a U.S. extremist group
The right to express abhorrent views is protected by 1st Amendment.
