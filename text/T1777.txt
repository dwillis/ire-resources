I.

Getting Access to the System
• Ask whether there are information and photo release
forms on file for some kids so you can use names,
faces. If not already on file, ask the agency to set that
up.
• Conduct informal interviews in advance to determine
what sources of data exist, what fields are in the
databases and how the system works.
• Review your state’s laws on juvenile records and court
access. If judges are allowed discretion, ask them for it.

II.

Data Sources

• Your state office of juvenile affairs or the agency
overseeing the juvenile justice system.
• Redacted database kept by your state. If they remove
the names, ask for a unique identifier to be put in place
of the name.
• Existing database of prisoners in the adult correctional
system. Does it have a field indicating contact with the
juvenile system?
• Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention
website has searchable databases with case statistics on
33 states. Data can also be ordered:
www.ncjrs.org/ojstattbb/njcda
• National Council of Juvenile and Family Court judges
• Lawsuits against the state, employees in the system
• Criminal charges against employees. Get electronic
payroll records.
• Reports to or by state lawmakers regarding the system
and how well it functions.
• Police, ambulance calls to facilities.

• Deaths at facilities. Check with the medical examiner’s
office.
• American Correctional Association audits of the
system.
• Minutes, reports of any boards or oversight agencies
that have jurisdiction over the system.
• Incident reports from facilities, especially use of force.
• Copies of policies to see if they are being followed.

III. What we asked for

• County-by-county stats on # of petitions (charges) filed
each year for four fiscal years, # of cases ending in
probation, # of cases ending in adjudication
(conviction), type of punishment received, # of cases
ending in probation, # of cases dismissed. Stats for each
fiscal year were kept in a separate sheet in an Excel file
and the fourth year was a master sheet allowing us to
tally activity over the four sheets with the following
formula (where each sheet was named after the fiscal
year): =SUM('1998'!B2,'1999'!B2,'2000'!B2,'2001'!B2)
• Average length of stay in each facility in the system.
• List of all facilities with addresses.
• Policies and procedures
• Statistics on number of youth in the system with
substance abuse problems, mental health issues.
• Demographic breakdown of youth in the system by age,
sex, race, educational level, county of residence, crimes
committed.
• Statistics on youthful offenders: youths in a bridge
program between the juvenile and adult systems.
• Monthly reports on how long youths are held in
detention center, listed by center
• If kids were being held in county jails, statistics on how
many and where. Incident reports from those jails.
• Copies of audits by the American Correctional
Association.
• Statistics on restraint use, assaults at facilities.
• Three years’ worth of line-item budget data

• Average caseload per OJA worker, broken down by
district.
• Tort claims naming OJA and any settlements.
• A list of fields contained in the agency’s database and
code sheets describing what they are.

IV. Advice

• Team up with a photographer from Day 1.
• Understand the system before you plan your project.
• Find out what sources of data are out there and fight for
them.
• Get as much access as you can. Don’t assume you can
never photograph faces or use names.
• Carry a permission form or release with you to get
access to kids in the system.
