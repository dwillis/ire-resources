STEP 1: Deciding that a pollution investigation is necessary
When there is no database to answer your question
Clues/Hints an investigation may be needed:
· Previous coverage based on anecdotal, not quantitative evidence
· Lack of published scientific research on this topic in your coverage area
· Exhaustive research of available databases at state and/or federal level finds
none with information you are looking for
· Area loosely regulated by state or federal agencies/authorities
· Disparate views of the situation: something doesn’t add up
· Community has long been seeking answer to similar question
STEP 2: Designing a pollution investigation
Methodology is the most important aspect of the independent-testing effort. This is what
you will have to defend and where most of the criticism will be focused. Planning before
commencing the testing will prevent you and your editors from saying, “We wish we had
done that” after the fact. There will always be limitations in the methodology. The key is
to ensure those limitations don’t undermine the conclusion completely.
· Talk to a large group of people from every side of the issue with knowledge in
monitoring or testing the same media. Don’t ask a water quality expert about air
monitoring. This group should include:
· academics
· government scientists
· industry specialists
· environmentalists with experience in pollution testing
· Ask these individuals about different testing techniques and their validity,
acceptance by various groups. List pluses and minuses and cost of various
technology, including analysis cost
· Other questions to ask: sample size, when and where to sample (generally), other
information needed to be collected to analyze the data.
· Review other self-testing efforts by journalists. Some good ones:
· In Harm’s Way, Houston Chronicle

· Mercury Taints Seafood, Mobile Register

· The Willamette’s Poisoned Heritage, The Oregonian, Dec. 17, 2000
NOTE OF CAUTION: Many people you will talk to will have a different standard for
methodology. Remember that you are not doing an investigation worthy of publication in
a scientific journal, so filter the suggestions to make them a better fit for a mainstream
publication.
STEP 3: Use existing databases to focus research
While there may not be data out there to answer your specific question, there will be
information available giving you an idea of where to look for the answer. Don’t be
arbitrary…if you are, you may waste time and money and come up empty.
· Databases that can show you where the pollution is, or what pollution is like at
a specific location:
· Toxics Release Inventory (quantity reported by industry)
www.epa.gov/tri
· EPA’s National Air Toxics Assessment (modeled ambient
concentrations): http://www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/nata/
· EPA Superfund Site: www.epa.gov/superfund/
· General air data: http://www.epa.gov/air/data/
· USGS Water Quality data: http://water.usgs.gov/nawqa/
· Fish consumption advisories, with local links:
http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/fish/
· Possible local databases:
· Air quality
· Water quality
· Complaints compiled by local government or by state agency about air,
water and other pollution problems
pollution problems
· Spill, accident, and upset records
· Routine inspections, compliance investigations
· Don’t forget to check non-environmental databases:
· Census.gov
· Court records – lawsuits, toxic torts
· Questions to ask of all databases. Need to understand what they do in order to
ensure that investigation if necessary and filling a gap:
· what specific chemicals are tested for, reported
· how often
· techniques used
· where is monitoring/inspections/complaints coming from
· how is data analyzed
STEP 4: Conducting test
Chances are you are only going to be able to do this once. And things will go wrong. If
there are multiple sites, start with least important first so you can work out the kinks by
the time you get to what you want to test. If single site, you may want to do a dry run by
collecting the samples, without analysis, before doing the real thing.
· Keep organized. Be methodical. Follow design to the letter and when something

goes wrong, take notes.
· Take detailed observations. Time sample taken, duration of sample, any
unexpected conditions
· If taking to lab, follow scientific protocols, such as cooling if necessary
STEP 5: Making sense of the numbers, the analysis
A number pertaining to pollution is meaningless to a reader unless you put it in context.
Is that number good or bad? Should I be concerned? In order to answer this question, you
must be able to compare your data to something meaningful, and it may not be the same
number the state or federal government uses. (This in itself could be a story!)
· What guidelines should I use?
· Check if there are federal standards for the amount of the chemical found
in fish, water, air. Make sure you use the correct route of exposure. If
fish is what is contaminated, don’t use guidelines based on inhaling the
chemical. Some examples:
National Ambient Air Quality Standards: http://www.epa.gov/air/criteria.html
Drinking Water Standards: http://www.epa.gov/safewater/standards.html
· If not, check with your state, non-profits, researchers about what
guidelines they use to interpret pollution data. Make sure you understand
how they are set, how they are used and their corresponding level of risk
EPA Integrated Risk Information System: http://www.epa.gov/iris/
Texas’ Effects Screening Levels for air toxics:

EPA’s Screening Levels for Hazardous Waste Sites
http://www.epa.gov/Region6/6pd/rcra_c/pd-n/screen.htm
· If don’t have a baseline, or universal standard, it helps to find data for
an unpolluted waterway, airshed, or property for comparison. Is this
more polluted than other places? Is it worse or better than the most
contaminated Superfund site? This type of work will help you with the
lede and nut graf, and summarizing the findings
· How to use guidelines:
· Determine if the chemical detected is a long-term or short-term health
risk
· Be careful of units. Make sure you convert the data you have into the
same units as the guideline that will be used.
· Getting data ready for comparison:
· Calculate maximum, minimum, average, and median
· Decide what you will do with values below detection limit. What is
typically done by researchers?
· Determine how to portray numbers above baseline
· Initial analysis:
· How many results above or below guideline chosen? How much above?
· May want to map where samples taken. Are they near a source of
pollution? Do you find a contaminant in one area you don’t find in
another?
· Compare to any available data from near site or from similar site to

determine if values you found within normal range
· Ideas for further analysis:
· Organize a “peer review” panel of experts different than those that
helped in design of study. These people should be foremost experts.
Supply them with a document highlighting results, and set of questions
· Provide those implicated by investigation/study with a report on how the
investigation was conducted and the results, giving ample time for
review
