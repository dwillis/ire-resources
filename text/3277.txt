"The Art of Source Development"
Sources, old and new, were crucial to the Detroit Free Press' Pulitzer Prize-winning
investigation into Kwame Kilpatrick, the Detroit mayor who was charged, convicted and
forced from office in 2008. The newspaper obtained nearly 14,000 text messages
between the mayor and his chief of staff that proved they had perjured themselves in a
civil lawsuit about their sexual affair and the firing of a police official. Furthermore, the
Free Press revealed -- using sources and the Freedom of Information Act -- that the
mayor had authorized the payout of $8.4 million from tax coffers, in part, to cover up his
misdeeds. Without credible sources, these revelations never would have come to light.
How do you get sources like this?

Tried and true methods
--Play by the rules, but also take full advantage of the rules
--We don't pay sources, but we do buy them lunch. And coffee. And beers. Lots of
beers.
--Use that expense account, liberally. Make your editor tell you you're spending too
much.
--Never assume someone won't talk.

How d o you get a new source to trust you?
--Play to your strengths
--If you're a good salesman, be one. If you're a flirt, be one. If you're selfdeprecating, work it. Don't try to be something you're not. Bring another reporter with
you sometimes. Make him or her play the good cop. Or the bad.
--References
-- "YOUcan ask so-and-so about me."
--Research sources before you approach, even if it's just a quick talk with another
reporter or a cursory Google search. Sources are easily flattered that you know something
about them.

--Be up front about the rules. Explain at the beginning what "on background" and "off the
record" mean.
--Pass their tests (Did the reporter live up to "off the record?" Was I quoted accurately?)
--No surprises. Tell them what to expect in the paper or the broadcast.
--Follow up the next day, ESPECIALLY if you are making a source look bad.
--Be visible. Go to the next day press conference. Mingle in the courthouse. Don't hide.
--Knock on doors instead of calling. People are naturally more polite in person, can't
hang up on you and are more likely to appreciate the seriousness of your efforts.

How do you build your own confidence in a source?
--Test their sincerity. Ask a question with an answer that you already know.
--Let them know that you will be corroborating their information. This is a warning to
them to be truthful.
--Ask them for references.
--Over time, remember how the: performed for you. Did they ever make mistakes? What
are their weaknesses? Do they exaggerate?
--Find out why they are talking to you. Ask them up front. Are they grinding axes? That's
OK but find out their motivations.
--Ask them if they will take a lie-detector test, just to gauge their reaction.

Long-term relationships

-- Very tricky. It's human to grc w close over time.

-- Don't call them your friend. Be very careful with this. Explain up fiont that the source
should like you because you are fair and trustworthy (not because you are a pal).
-- Get used to writing tough stories. One of the hardest fears to overcome is writing
critical stories. Learn that when one door shuts, six more might open.
--Targets of critical stories sometimes become your best sources. When they have a story,
they go to the reporter who can get it done.
--Don't buy them gifts; do send them cards and e-mails. Note their achievements and
their failures. Stay interested in them.
--Call, write, stop by when you DON'T need something. Sources get tired of needy
reporters who swoop in like vultures on deadline.
--See them away from the office. This puts sources more at ease.
