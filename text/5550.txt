10 TIPS FOR
INVESTIGATING
DAM SAFETY
By Ralph K.M. Haurwitz, Austin American-Statesman
Dams provide flood control, drinking water, fishing opportunities and other benefits, but they can threaten homes, businesses and roads with a catastrophic release of water if they fail.
An investigation published in November by the Austin American- Statesman found that several hundred dams upstream of
populated areas in Texas violate state law because they could be
breached by severe floods. The law requires such dams to be capable of holding up against a worst-case flood or, in some cases, a flood half or three-fourths as severe, depending on the size
of the dam and the number of people expected to lose their lives
if it collapsed.
Here are 10 tips for investigating dams in any community:

1. Scope out the big
picture. The U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers
maintains the National
Inventory of Dams, and its
interactive website (nid.
usace.army.mil) has
information on more than
90,000 dams, including
city, county, creek or
river, purpose and even
the name of the U.S.
House member in whose
district a dam is located.
The Federal Emergency
Management Agency
(fema.gov/dam-safety)
and the Association of
Dam Safety Officials
(damsafety.org) are
also good sources, as
are the websites of state
agencies that regulate
dam safety.

2. Scout the territory.
You can’t miss the Hoover
Dam, but the vast majority
of dams are much smaller
earthen structures, many
of which blend into the
landscape. You can
locate some dams by
using online programs
such as Google Maps to
look for bodies of water.
For example, zooming
in on a wide stretch of
Brushy Creek at the
eastern edge of Cedar
Park, Texas, reveals the
label “Soil Conservation
Service Site 7 Reservoir,” a
telltale clue.

3. Expect obstacles.
After the 9/11 terrorist
attacks, some federal
and state agencies
have sharply restricted
the ability of news
organizations and the
public to obtain certain
information on specific
dams, citing security
concerns. The restricted
information includes
whether dams are
classified as high-hazardpotential — meaning
their failure would
threaten human life — and
whether such dams could
withstand half, most, or
all of a worst-case flood
as generally required.
You can often obtain a
considerable amount of
aggregate information
from regulators, although
in some cases it might
require filing an open
records request.

4. Seek out local officials.
Cities, water districts and
other local government
units that own dams are
sometimes willing to
share details state and
federal regulators won’t
divulge, in part because
disclosure can build public
awareness and support
for improvements. In
Texas, the Upper and
Lower Brushy Creek
Water Control and
Improvement Districts
helped us by granting
interviews, conducting
tours and sharing some
site-specific information,
such as engineering
reports on dams that fall
short of meeting safety
standards and dams that
have been upgraded.
The city of Austin also
provided site-specific
information, including
a list broken down by
dams that have been
modernized to meet
state standards, those
in need of preliminary
engineering for upgrades
and ones that have
yet to be evaluated.
Because the list included
addresses, we were able
to produce a map.

5. Bone up on the rules.
Laws and regulations
can be eye-opening. The
Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality, in
a departure from national
norms, applies stricter
safety standards to dams
whose failure would be
expected to cost seven
or more lives than it does
to dams whose collapse
could cost up to six lives.
A little-known Texas law
exempts more than 3,000
dams from inspections
and other safety
requirements because
of their relatively small
size and rural location —
including more than 200
whose collapse could
cause fatalities.

6. Craft questions
with precision.
The Texas environmental
commission declined to
make anyone available
for an interview, but took
written questions. I sent
an extensive list and the
agency responded to
each question and, later,
my follow-up queries. The
commission’s answers
included a wealth of
aggregate data. For
example, it said 80
percent of dams whose
failure would put people
at risk — not counting the
exempted ones — had
been inspected in the
last five years, and 77
percent of dams under
the agency’s oversight
have submitted required
emergency plans. The
commission declined
on security grounds to
identify specific dams
at issue, and a previous
ruling by the state
attorney general backs
that stance.

7. Look into disaster
preparedness.
The owners of dams
whose failure would put
lives at risk are generally
required to have
emergency action plans,
but more than 4,800 such
dams nationwide lack
those plans, according
to the Army Corps.
Enforcement is spotty.
Some dam owners will
share emergency plans,
but they are generally
exempt from open
records requests. Some
plans include maps of the
inundation zone, the area
that would be flooded if
a dam collapsed. Some
local officials will let you
look at these plans but
not copy them.

8. Interview those in
harm’s way.
Residents, business
owners and neighborhood
association leaders in
areas downstream from
substandard dams add
a human dimension to a
story that might otherwise
be heavy on data and
policy. Some people we
talked to were living near
a dam and weren’t aware
of its existence, much
less that they could be
in harm’s way if severe
flooding breached it.

9. Work closely with a
photographer and editor.
It helps to have another
set of eyes and ears to
gather impressions and,
of course, to document
the story visually, which
the American-Statesman’s
Ricardo Brazziell did with
skill. I discussed reporting
strategy with investigative
editor Robert Eckhart,
and he made sure I had
enough time to do the
necessary digging. The
project took about two
months, although I wrote
several articles on other
topics during that period
as well.

10. Follow up.
Many elected officials
don’t know there are
substandard dams in
their jurisdictions. The
mayor of Austin, the
city’s state senator
and three chairmen of
legislative committees
pledged to look into the
need for dam repairs
and stricter regulation.
Also worthwhile: circling
back to regulators and
dam owners to see if
your report has effected
change. I wrote about
dam safety in Texas 20
years ago, finding an
alarming state of neglect
with nearly two-thirds of
dams above populated
areas uninspected for at
least five years. The state
subsequently increased
the size and budget of its
regulatory staff.
