Homeownership rate has returned to 1990s levels…

25

When Zillow asked hundreds of current renters why
they don’t own, they said…
Income affordability (53%):
·
Because I can’t afford the maintenance, taxes and monthly payments of
homeownership (18%)
·
Because I can’t qualify for a home loan (16%)
·
Because I don’t have a down payment saved for a home (13%)
·
I receive government assistance with my rent (6%)

Lifestyle/preferences (26%):
·
I simply prefer to rent (20%)
·
I could afford to buy a home, but not the size or style or location that I would want
(4%)
·
I like the amenities in my rental community/complex (2%)
Uncertainty (15%):
·
I’m not certain how long I will live here, and/or I’m only living here for a short time
(14%)
·
I recently sold my home and have not yet found another to buy (1%)

Other: 4%
