Toolkit
Scripts and files to help you get started using the IRS's electronically
filed non-profit returns in XML format
https://github.com/tranquilli/irs990_xml_tools
The toolkit contains pre-written scripts to process the XML returns for
the years 2011 – 2016 and extract data into three separate tables:
-­‐ Basic data from the header and main return and a record of which
schedules were filed. (table irs990__returns)
-­‐ Trustees and directors (table irs990_td)
-­‐ Highest paid employees (table irs990_hp)

What about the 2017 return?
2017 returns haven’t started coming in. Once they do, you’ll need to
check two tags in the header: return type and tax year. If the tag
names are different from previous years you’ll need to update the
script read_xml_structure.php on lines 83-93.
<Return xmlns="http://www.irs.gov/efile" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.or
g/2001/XMLSchemainstance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.irs.gov/efile" returnVersion
="2012v2.3">

Some cautions
One of the biggest challenges in working with the IRS 990 XML data
is dealing with tag names that may change every few years or by
form type.
For example, in the 2014-2016 returns Trustees and Directors are
found in the main return of all form types but each type uses different
tag names:

990	  -­‐	  Form990PartVIISectionAGrp
990PF	  -­‐	  OfficerDirTrstKeyEmplInfoGrp-­‐>OfficerDirTrstKeyEmplGrp	  
	  
990EZ	  -­‐	  OfficerDirectorTrusteeEmplGrp

And this is how they appear in the 2011-2012 returns:
990	  -­‐	  Form990PartVIISectionA
990PF	  -­‐	  OfcrDirTrusteesKeyEmployeeInfo-­‐
>OfcrDirTrusteesOrKeyEmployee
	  
	  
990EZ	  -­‐	  OfficerDirectorTrusteeKeyEmpl

You will find scripts in the toolkit to help simplify this process and
make it easier to identify other data you want to capture. It also helps
to download and read over copies of the print returns.

https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-990ez
https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-990pf

If you add new tables to the database, make sure you set fields for
dollar amounts to bigint.

IRS990 XML
https://aws.amazon.com/public-datasets/irs-990/
The XML returns are listed in large master indexes by the year filed.
The indexes are available in in .json or .csv formats. These are large
files. I recommend using the command line to download. DON’T try
opening the .json files in your browser!
The json contains the complete URL for each XML return. If you’re
working with the csv you’ll need to build the URL yourself using the
OBJECT_ID column
https://s3.amazonaws.com/irs-form-990/OBJECT_ID_public.xml

Schedules for Form 990
https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-990-schedules
The links to the schedules are broken (as of March 6, 2018). You
can still get them by correcting the URLs from

https://prod.edit.irs.gov/forms-pubs/{…} to https://www.irs.gov/formspubs/{…}
Not every 990 type uses every schedule. Here’s the breakdown:
Schedule

990EZ

990PF

A
B
C
D
E
F
G
H
I
J
K
L
M
N
O
R

As you can see, forms 990EZ and 990PF have fewer schedules than
990. They may still contain some of the same data but it will be in
other places. For example, highest paid employees are listed in
Schedule J for 990 but are in the main returns for 990EZ and 990PF.
