EVERYTHING IN GOVERNMENT IS A NUMBER/LIST
If you don’t know where to start, get a list of something.

-Participants
-Staff Lists
-Police Calls For Service
-Former Staff Lists/Terminations
-Campaign Contribution/Expenditures
-Fuel Pumps Locations/Inspections

THE MOTHER LODE: LICENSES/INSPECTIONS
-Check out the good, the bad and the awful among your
license holders. Nursing homes, contractors, bars, schools,
funeral homes, day care, home health companies, nail
salons, etc.
-Go beyond the number of bad inspection reports.
Did bad conditions cause death? How many? How frequent?
-Map your regulated providers. Are they located in one
area of your city/town/region/state? Why?
-Look at bare minimums/entry points
Are the shadier ones a problem for law enforcement?
How many different types of licenses for the same category
of facility? What's the easiest license to get? Possible
Outcome?
