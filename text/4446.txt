SUMMONS DATA
• Import SAMS
• Import Precinct demographics
Make sure all your data types are correct:
• In SAMS, precinct and county should be strings and dimensions because they are
attributes, not numbers we would use for calculations. Also, you can’t join with a
number. Drag them both into the dimensions panel, right-click and select “change
data type” and change to string
• In Precinct Demographics, Precinct should be a string
• Always double-check to make sure your data imported properly — count your number
of records, drag some of your dimensions into the rows shelf, etc.
• Notes about the data — there are seven precincts that send summonses to
community court, which is a separate dataset. For the purpose of this exercise
we’re ignoring this fact.
Creating relationships between data sets:
• Go to “data” in the menu bar, and select “edit relationships”
• Join the “precinct” field in SAMS and Precinct Demographics
• Test your joins — Precinct and Precinct Name now gives you the name of the police
precinct
• If you drag “precinct name” from the precinct demographics table into the filters panel
and uncheck “null” it will only give you the precincts that join.
• In the SAMS data window, drag “number of records” from measures into the table and
you will get a count of the number of summonses written out in each precinct.
Calculated fields:
• Say we want to look at a rate per 100 residents, to see if the rate is higher in black
and Hispanic precincts. We need to write a few formulas:
• Count the number of records per precinct. Go to the SAMS data, right-click in
measures, and create a calculated field called “count pct”:
⁃
COUNT([Precinct])
• Go to Precinct demographics, right-click in measures, and create a calculated field
called “per 100 residents”:
⁃
[SAMS 2001].[count pct]/(sum([Population])/100)
• Note that we needed to “sum” the population because you can’t mix aggregate and

non-aggregate arguments.
• Check your work! From SAMS, Drag “precinct” into rows, number of records and
count precinct into columns — it’s the same number. Now from precinct
demographics, drag population and per 100 residents into columns. The rate is
correct.
• Add a filter for the year and the arresting agency (NYPD) to get a more accurate/
meaningful rate.
• Say we want to calculate a percentage point spread to, say, refute the police
commissioner’s claim that blacks and Hispanics are getting more tickets only
because cops are concentrating their efforts in the areas with the highest crime.
First we need to calculate the percent of summonses that go to blacks and
hispanics in the SAMS data:
⁃
((COUNT([Bh Nbh]))/(COUNT([Race Eth])))*100
• Note: I created a new column in my underlying data that returned “BH” if the race/
ethnicity was black or Hispanic and nothing otherwise because I knew I would
need to use this a lot.
• I multiplied this formula by 100 because my “percentages” in the precinct
demographic table are actually not percentages. These tend to work better in
Tableau for some reason.
• Tableau won’t count “nulls” in the total.
• Now you need a formula to subtract the percent black and Hispanic of the precinct
from this figure. Create this calculated field:
⁃
[Percent BH]-SUM([Sheet1 (Precinct Demographics)].[%PopBlkHisp])
• You can explore this by charge, year, etc.
• You can then create a calculation for the percent not black or Hispanic:
⁃
100-((count([Bh Nbh]))/(count([Race Eth]))*100)
• And then calculate a percentage point spread to quickly identify the charges with the
greatest disparities:
⁃
[Percent BH]-[Percent NBH]
• The average number of days until a disposition:
⁃
DATEDIFF('day',[Issuedate],[Dispodate])
• Drag “county” into rows and the calculation into the table, then right click on the
calculation pill in the marks panel and format it to an average, so you have the
average days until disposition for a case by county.
• An IIF statement that classifies arresting agency as “NYPD” or “Other”:
⁃
IIF([Arresting Agency]='NYPD','NYPD','Other')
• A rank of the number of records, so you can easily filter to only look at your top
charges:

⁃

RANK(COUNT([Charge Description]))

Quick linear regression:
• From the SAMS data source, drag “number of records” into the area of the y-axis —
this is the dependent variable
• From the precinct demographics data, drag “%PopBlkHisp” into the area of the x-axis
— this is the independent variable
• If you get an error message — follow instructions and click that broken link icon next
to “Precinct” in the dimensions pane
• Now drag precinct into the table — it’s plotting the precincts based on the number of
summonses issued and the percent population that is black and hispanic. You
can see that the more heavily black and Hispanic precincts are getting hit with
more summonses.
• You can drag “precinct name” into the tooltip box in the marks panel so you can see
the actual precinct name when you hover over the point for each precinct.
• If you want to look at only a specific charge, from the SAMS data, drag “New
Description” into the filters pane and select a group of charges, such as
“disorderly conduct.”
• Also drag “Arresting Agency” into the filters shelf and select only those summonses
issued by the NYPD.
• In order to see the trend line, go to analysis and select “trend lines” and “see trend
line”
• More on how to read these later, but if you right click the trend line and select
“describe trend model,” you’ll see the p-value and the r-squared value.
• Replace “number of records” on the rows shelf with “per 100 residents.” That big
outlier is Central Park, which apparently has 25 residents. Right-click it and
choose “exclude.”
