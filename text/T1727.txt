The Press as Government Watchdog
Let Your Browser Do the Walking

More and more government agencies have created Web sites to serve the public, boast of their
accomplishments, spend taxpayer dollars, etc. Other organizations, in turn, have created national
directories of such sites, potentially easing your searches.
• State constitutions and official web sites: www.constitution.org/cons/usstcons.htm
• State statutes: www.prairienet.org/~scruffy/f.htm
• State and Local Government on the Net: www.statelocalgov.net/index.cfm
• State and Local Governments via U.S. Library of Congress:
http://lcweb.loc.gov/global/state/stategov.html
• FirstGov.gov (Federal): www.firstgov.gov
• Census of Government: www.census.gov/govs/www/index.html
• Project Vote Smart: www.vote-smart.org
Once you find your state’s official website, look for and bookmark any index of state agencies as
well as any directory of state employees. Search out comparable resources for your county or city.

Read What Your Sources and Subjects Do:
