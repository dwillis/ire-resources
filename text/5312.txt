Why are we talking about this?

❧

Documents and data help you tell a story
❧
❧

Provides facts and material for narrative writing
Makes individuals’ stories more broadly relevant

❧

Reduces the amount of “he said, she said”
reporting

❧

Cuts through lies

❧

Leads you closer to The Truth

❧

But BEWARE: Documents and data are not
infallible

Open records laws
●

●

●

The concept:
○ Taxpayers pay for government, so activities of public officials &
agencies should be transparent.
Each state has it’s own law. Learn yours.
○ How much can your state charge for copying costs?
○ Did you know that they must provide you with documents in their
“original format?” No PDFs of spreadsheets.
○ Don’t assume public officials know the law, or will apply it correctly
Federal government has it’s own law:
○ The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
○ Nine exemptions

Kentucky
Open Records Act
●

●

Applies to:
○ State and local government agencies, officials, school and special
boards
○ Bodies that receive at least 25% of their funds from state or local
authority
○ Access to public meetings (Open Meetings Act)
14 exceptions include:
○ Personal privacy, proprietary information, testing materials before
administered, some law enforcement information

With each story …

Develop a “documents state of mind”
(or data state of mind)

Step one: Find out what exists
❧

Ask people
❧
Understand how a process works, what is written down

❧

Looks at forms
❧

❧

Paper and online: If it’s collected, it’s kept (most likely in a database)

Read and look for clues
❧

GAO reports, meeting minutes, inspector general reports, footnotes

❧

Ask for a “record layout” or “data dictionary”

❧

Do not give up if at first people won’t tell you OR say it’s
complicated
❧

This is “Stalling Tactic No. 1” for government officials

How to get what you
want
❧

❧

Be reasonable and polite, yet firm
❧
❧

Use simple logic
You are not a superhero or a vigilante. Do not act like one.

Ask for their help
❧
❧

Don’t be afraid to explain what you’re seeking
Negotiate

❧

Keep track of all requests and follow-up
❧
They are hoping you forget
❧
Think of these as “data orders” rather than requests

❧

Consider limiting the scope of your request
❧
File three requests instead of a single, major one
❧
Remember: You can always circle back for more
❧
State monetary limit in writing: “Contact me if request exceeds $100.”

When you’re stuck …
❧

❧

Have you reached the correct person?
❧
❧

Don’t be afraid to go above someone’s head
Think about who is ultimately accountable

What other agency might have the records/data
you are seeking?
❧
❧

Local agency reports to state. State agency reports
to feds.
Triangulate the topic: Make a list of all agencies
and records that might touch it

You have the data/documents.
What can you do with it?
❧

Find facts

❧

Corroborate what people tell you

❧

Establish what people won’t tell you

❧

Tell a story

❧

Add detail to your work

❧

Give context

Hundreds of juveniles accused of crimes in the Jacksonville area in recent years have
been locked up in detention for longer than Florida law intends and longer than
children in any other part of the state, a Times-Union investigation has found.

And some of the children are serving these unofficial jail sentences — in a facility filled
over capacity more often and with more reported fights than any other center in
Florida — without ever being formally charged with a crime.

To state officials and psychologists, there’s no question that the son of Reggie Reeves and Crystal Allen needs
focused therapy and other mental help.
Reeves’ and Allen’s son has been diagnosed with several mental health conditions including oppositional
defiance and attention deficit disorder.
He has been in an out of the juvenile and mental health systems for years. He was involuntarily committed for
mental health concerns, or Baker Acted, 14 times in a 14-month period that began last year. He has been
arrested for crimes such as criminal mischief and multiple counts of battery against a school board employee.
He’s 11 years old.
“We all want him to get help,” Kelly told Gooding in the same August hearing. “He desperately needs it. If he
doesn’t, I think it’s clear the results are going to be disastrous for [him] and possibly somebody else.”

A migrant from El Salvador gets her
chance in immigration court
The fact that Garcia has legal representation is rare and
could be pivotal. A study by the Transactional Records
Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University (TRAC)
analyzed more than 26,000 asylum proceedings of
adults with children last year, and found that less than
one-third had legal representation. About 26 percent of
the applicants with lawyers successfully won permission
to stay in the US, whereas only 1.5 percent of those
without won their claims — 98.5 percent of migrants
with children who did not have lawyers were deported.

A migrant from El Salvador gets her
chance in immigration court
This is the first time Garcia has had a chance to make a
case for herself and her children before a judge, apart
from hearings to schedule court appearances. This is
also the first hearing for both of Garcia's lawyers, who
are third-year law students. The lead, Kelsey Krier,
studied this judge’s track record nervously before today.
Judge Rosalind Malloy seems to have softened up over
the years. According to TRAC’s analysis, she denied
over 60 percent of the asylum cases that came before
her in 2010. But by 2014, the most recent numbers
available, her denial rate was just 20 percent.
