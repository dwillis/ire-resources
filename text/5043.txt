Introducing Klaxon
Monitor the web for newsworthy changes
Tom Meagher, @ultracasual

The problem...
● How often does a website I care about on my beat
update?
● Does it change enough for me to mine it for data for
reporting or an interactive?
● How can I get alerts for a site that doesn’t offer RSS?
● What if we only care if one small piece of a page
changes?
