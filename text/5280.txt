Backgrounding People

●

Who is this man?

●

We think it’s David R. True a retired
ATF agent from Kansas City,
Missouri, but how do we verify?

Backgrounding People
Start broad -- what’s Google tell us?

Backgrounding People
Reverse Google Image Search?

Backgrounding People: Try other search engines
besides Google!

Backgrounding People -- Now what?
Nexis can be wrong!
Most county property records are online
Marriage certificate -- might have to file a records request
Don’t forget about clip searches
Rapportive to hunt down an email address
Know what public records you can get - Court Reference

Backgrounding Businesses
Wayback Machine: Find old versions of sites, or save pages you want to be able to access later (in
case they take something down). Find old boards, old news, etc.

SCORE!

Backgrounding Businesses
Google Scholar: Can search research, articles and patents. Useful for finding associates and
tracking the future interests of a company.

Backgrounding Businesses
SEC’s EDGAR database: Find filings from public companies. Things like quarterly reports (10-Q),
annual reports (10-K), proxy statements which have info on executives/board members and pay
(DEF 14A), correspondence between company and SEC (CORRESP).

Backgrounding Businesses
PACER: Public Access to Court Electronic Records allows you to look at U.S.
district, bankruptcy, and appellate court records. Has the company been
sued?
● Costs 10 cents per page! :(
Sqoop: A free service for journalists that lets you keep tabs on federal court
cases, SEC filings & patents. You can see what kind of results you might get
in PACER before paying the 10-cent fees to download docs. Can also set up
alerts for specific search you’re interested in.
● RECAP browser extension: Online archive of PACER documents,
available for free. Donate your documents to a public repo.

Backgrounding Businesses
USAspending.gov: Government contract information

Backgrounding Businesses
OpenSecrets: Information on political donations and lobbying. Who are they giving money to? Who’s
contributing to their PAC? What issues and bills do they care about?

More options!
●

●

LinkedIn (kinda) and Facebook to find employees
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
Establishment Search for inspection data.
whois domain searches - and reverse searches!
SmartProcure, the largest government purchasing database.
○ Requires a fee, but IRE members get a discount.
Federal Procurement Data System, another option for looking at
government contracts. Less user friendly than USAspending.gov.

Background Businesses
Ask yourself:
● Where does this business cross paths with the
government (local/state/federal)?
● What documents and records do those
connections yield?
● Are those records online, or do I need to put in a
records request?

Final tips from the librarian
●

Have a researcher’s frame of mind.

●

Use your eyes

●

Start broad and narrow results on what you find

●

Keep a spreadsheet of each search you conduct

●

Don’t be afraid to let go of pieces you can’t confirm

●

Use operators -- Boolean (NOT AND OR -- in that order),
truncation, wild cards, parenthesis

●

Utilize the Help page on databases -- they should help!

Final tips from the journalist
●

Don’t be afraid to ask for help – journalists (and
non-journalists) are more generous than you think.

●

Develop a template for yourself and/or your newsroom.

●

Backgrounding isn’t just for big investigations and
elections.

●

Don’t get distracted by shiny things. Gather all your
findings, then process them.
