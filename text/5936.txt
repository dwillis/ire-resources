DEEP GOOGLE SEARCH
Use your initial Google search to find useful documents, possible data or
human sources and other reporting leads (We usually start every
investigation with this)

different possible spellings, etc.

filetype:xls, etc. (Example: “nursing homes” filetype:xls)

●​ ​Can search specific kinds of websites, such as government sites by
searching site:.gov, site:.org, ny.gov, etc. (Example: “nursing homes”
site:cms.gov)
Tips for requesting government emails
● ​Pick keywords and narrow time frame to start
● ​Find out who owns and operates the servers
● ​Use sources to give you tight windows or even the date emails were sent
or received (or ideas of what keywords might be best)
