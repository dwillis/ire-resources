Warnings
Audio & other laws
Federal law does not allow a third party to listen in on audio tape. Even if your state
allows one-party consent, it may not protect you with a wireless camera. Don’t stream
audio with the video unless your lawyer is comfortable with it. Check state laws.
This law protects your rights to use the camera
US Code Title18, Part1, Chapter119, Section 2511
(c) It shall not be unlawful under this chapter for a person
acting under color of law to intercept a wire, oral, or electronic
communication, where such person is a party to the communication or
one of the parties to the communication has given prior consent to
such interception.
This statement should make you use extreme caution:
Justice Department: “The person in the van monitoring the video/audio transmission IN
THEORY could be considered a “third party”, not one of the communicating parties.”

Warnings (Continued)
Assume YOU are on hidden camera- conduct yourself accordingly.
