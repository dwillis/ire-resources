My Friend FRED®: The St. Louis Fed’s Free Tool for Economic Data
What Is FRED?
Short for Federal Reserve Economic Data, FRED is the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’
signature economic database. Journalists can use it to tap into more than 61,000 frequently
updated data series to add context to their stories about the economy. It imports data directly
into graphs and Excel spreadsheets, allowing users to easily compare local, national or
international data over periods of time. The data series come from 53 public and private
sources.
