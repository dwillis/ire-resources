Goals
● Build watchdog reporting into your daily routine
● Develop organizational strategies to help you juggle daily and project work
● Every reporter should develop a watchdog mindset

Investigative/watchdog/accountability reporting
● Offer your readers quantifiable evidence, not just anecdotes
● Don’t take things at face value
● Follow up

Can Investigative Journalism Save Your Newsroom?
Check out this IRE/AR&D survey (2013)

Survey says ...
● Two-thirds of respondents said investigative
reporting builds trust in a news organization
● Six in 10 said it’s a reason to regularly follow a
news organization

Survey says ...

“I think it’s one of the main purposes of
journalism. Journalism is more than just saying
what happened; it’s putting things into context,
making connections to similar occurrences in the
past, not taking things at face value.”
— Respondent to AR&D survey

The problem
Newsrooms are broke, and investigative reporting
can be expensive and time-consuming

The solution
Create a culture of everyday investigative work:
●
●
●
●

Build good habits
ABR: Always Be Requesting public records
Maintain an arsenal of deadline data
Commit to training and professional
development
● Celebrate wins

Generating watchdog content
● Be curious — ask the extra questions:
○
○
○
○

Is that true?
How do you know that?
How are those records kept?
Can you send me the report/data?

● Follow paper and database trails
● FOIA all the time -- build a continuous pipeline of records requests
● Story pattern: Quantified evidence, supportive anecdotes

“Regard the press conference as the scoop you
did not get, but the opportunity to corner the
high-ranking authority avoiding you.”
-- “The beat as investigation,” Paige St. John, Los Angeles Times

Generating watchdog content
● Don’t just attribute facts — verify them!
● Be the arbiter of truth to the extent possible -- get beyond he said/she said
● Understand how something is supposed to work -- laws, rules, standards -- and
compare that to how things actually work
● Background everyone in the story to some extent

Generating watchdog content
Build it into your routine:
● Obtain and check resumes of key hires by entities you cover
● Regularly check for lawsuits involving agencies, officials and companies you
cover
● Source up people with oversight responsibilities within the companies and
public agencies you cover: auditors, inspectors general, etc.

Generating watchdog content
● Follow relevant rules/laws as they’re made: Track local ordinances, state and
federal regulations, state and federal legislation
● Who’s pushing for or against rules/laws/regulations and why?
● Follow the (election) money: Contributions, expenditures, ethics filings
● Who’s lobbying?

Generating watchdog content
Follow up!
● A company is getting a big tax writeoff as part of an economic development
program that requires them to do X. Did the company actually do X?
● A new regulation promises to stop some kind of abuse in the industry you
cover. Was it actually effective?
● A federal consent decree mandates that City X undertake specific police
reforms. Did that happen?
If not, why not? Go down the rabbit hole until your questions are answered.

Generating watchdog content
Background everyone
● Create a standard protocol for backgrounding subjects of news stories
○
○
○

Elected officials, candidates for office, business owners, other power players
People-on-the-street interviews
Any quoted by name or who provides information as a source

● Fit research strategy to time limits and story scope
● Sometimes, the backgrounding process unearths an untold story

Build: Three levels of stories
1. Straight news story (good): "John Doe, a board member at XYZ Company in
Honolulu, was indicted Tuesday on eight counts of insider trading."
2. Trend/pattern story (better): "Federal prosecutors in Hawaii have brought
more insider trading cases in 2018 than they had in the previous three years
combined, according to data from the U.S. District Court for the District of
District of Hawaii."
3. Explanatory analysis (best): "Interviews and public documents show that
federal prosecutors in Honolulu are taking a gloves-off approach to charging
corporate board members for financial crimes."

The watchdog pitch: Is the juice worth the squeeze?

How often does this happen?
Why is this still a problem?
Who’s responsible for fixing this?
What’s the fallout from all this?
What’s the context?

The watchdog pitch: Is the juice worth the squeeze?
A good litmus test for solid investigative enterprise:
●
●
●
●

Affects everyday people
Plows new ground
Has victims
Offers room for reform

Build an arsenal of deadline data
Be ready when news breaks. Obtain -- or know how to quickly obtain -- key records
on your beat:
●
●
●
●
●
●

Audits, annual reports
Phone directories/organizational charts (go back a few years)
Voter rolls (source finder)
Regulatory filings
Budgets, payroll records
Special fund and travel records

How to begin
● Start slowly
● Spin off everyday stories
● Set aside time each week for source development
○
○
○

Get past the flacks
Talk to everyone
Understand the lingo (and translate it for readers)

How to begin
● Every day, try to understand the institutions you cover a little better -- chip
away!
○
○

When news breaks, you’ll have a more complete map in your head of where to look for key info
Carve out bits of time to fill in the gaps in your knowledge

● When developing your project, go deep, not wide
● Run down tips (or at least make a phone call) -- start a newsroom-wide tip log

Ask the extra questions
● Listen for keywords: “data,” “our analysis shows,” “we have found,” etc.
○
○
○
○

How do you know that?
Can I check your figures myself?
How does that form get into this database?
How far back do you keep this information?

Ask the extra questions
● Be curious
● Follow your gut
● Keep pulling that thread

In the beginning
●
●
●
●

What’s my minimum story?
Do enough reporting/analysis to write a solid pitch memo
Focus on central questions of your story -- don’t get bogged down
Start with a hypothesis, but be ready to be proven wrong

People sources
Data sources
Documents and records
Asset list (or wishlist): Timelines, maps, photos, graphics, videos, interactives

Juggling a project and a daily beat
● Bite off only what you can chew
● Be realistic about time expectations
● Communicate with your editor -- have a solid pitch before you make the ask

Juggling a project and a daily beat
● Use time-management tools:
○
○
○
○
○

Lists and calendars (set reminders => “check on records request”)
Trello
todo.txt
Slack/Howdy.ai
Whatever works for you

Juggling a project and a daily beat
● As your skills develop, lead newsroom training brown-bags (free training!)
● Come up with a routine to prioritize your work (I like the “Eisenhower matrix”)

IMPORTANCE

URGENCY

Keep a list of “off my
back” stories

Handling upset sources
● Always be fair: No surprises, give them plenty of time to respond/rebut/spin
● Call them soon after the story runs, offer to have coffee (maybe wait a day if it’s
a really tough story)
● Mix beat reporting/features with watchdog stories

Handling upset sources
● Be relentless. Some people will dislike you ... and that’s OK! It’s not your job to
make friends
● Be accountable: “What did you think of the story?”
● Keep lines of communication open -- sometimes angry subjects become good
sources

Now what?
● Start right away
