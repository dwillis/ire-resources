Mining for Gold in County and State Government
* Find out the specific regulatory body responsible for policing and/or regulating the issue disclosed by your victim
or tipster. The more obscure the agency, the less likely the particular agency officials are used to dealing with
reporters. The less experienced they are in dealing with you, the more fun you will have.
* Make inquiries simple and direct. Attempt to get information without formalized public information requests.
Get the information informally whenever possible. Try to set the information sharing standard, before the officials
do.
*Search the agency’s on‐line website for data about other similar cases or victims. Agencies will frequently not
know what's in their own data base. They often don't know their own policies. Use their inability to
connect‐the‐dots to your advantage.
* Check agency meetings, scanning the minutes for possible reports or even recorded video of meetings. You may
find meetings that highlight the issue you are investigating. Determine what officials may be sympathetic or critical
of a respective issue.
* Ask for complaint and compliance/enforcement histories related to a particular issue.
* Make an agency disclose not only the quantity, but the overall quality of their enforcement. Determine if the
enforcement solves the problem, or if it is merely window dressing.
* Stories often are enhanced by comparing enforcement and/or performance with other counties or states.
* Aggressively hold agency officials (ii. e. directors and commissioners) accountable. Make sure they know you
are contacting them and requesting answers. Always give a deadline.
* Agency heads are NOT used to being held accountable by reporters, they insulate themselves very well.
* Give them ample opportunity to respond, then show up at their agency meetings or offices. Be prepared to
catch them at the dais or on their way to their cars.
* Know the answer to the questions before you ask. Focus on the key points you need answered.
*** Engage elected officials in the conversation and in the possible solution. They are always looking for a cause
and a headline.
* Exposing a problem is only half of a powerful story series. The other half of a series should include pointing out
possible debate of agency actions, along with solutions or amended responses to an issue. Ultimately, your
stories will show that includes possible change or reforms.
* Don't give up until you get results.
