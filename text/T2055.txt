Investigating airline safety
Many databases can help reporters make sense of airline safety
problems.
Here are some of them:
-For information on serious airline accidents, consult the National
Transportation Safety Board's aviation accident database, which is
available
for download or online query - http://www.ntsb.gov/ntsb/query.asp
-Use the FAA's Accident/Incident Data System to get information about
non-fatal incidents that aren't included in the NTSB's database. To
query
this and other FAA databases online, go to
http://afs600.faa.gov/AFS620.htm
-Service Difficulty Reports typically provide information about
mechanical
malfunctions that aren't serious enough to wind up in the NTSB accident
database. If you have a plane's tail number, the SDR database can yield
information about whether the aircraft has had past safety problems.
The FAA
requires airlines to file these reports. But it's hard to compare one
airline to another using SDR data because reporting practices vary
widely.
-The FAA's Enforcement Information System is a database of information
on
FAA actions against people and organizations in the aviation industry.
It's
in the NICAR data library.
-The FAA's Program Tracking and Reporting Subsystem database includes
information about FAA inspections of contract repair stations and
nonmajor
airlines. This data is available through the Freedom of Information
Act.
-For statistics on airline spending, departures, revenues, etc., use
the
Bureau of Transportation Statistics' TranStats database:
