Consumer Investigations: Stories that Make a Difference
IRE 2018
Orlando, Fla
A few places to look for good investigative stories
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau:
https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/
• Complaints about student loans, mortgages, credit cards, debt
collectors, credit-reporting agencies
• No names, limited narrative of the issue
• May become very unhelpful under the current administration.
Federal Trade Commission
• Collects complaints from Better Business Bureau, Attorneys General
offices, law enforcement and consumers
• Tracks fraud, identity theft and unfair business practices
• Need to file FOIA
• No names but can get detailed narrative of the problem
• Also search here to see if the company has been any enforcement
action taken: https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings
Attorneys General
• Complaints public in at least 25 states
• Most of those states provide name and contact information for
consumers
• Find complaints on dating services, breeders, travel-related services,
vitamins, toys, landlords, etc.
• Tracks identity theft and unfair business practices
• Also tracks charities and charitable gaming (i.e. Catholic schools’ Las
Vegas nights, bingo, etc.) and investigates wrongdoing

• And serves as debt collector for public universities including schoolissued student loans. How aggressive are they? Ironically, AGs offices
often go after rogue debt collectors for violating the law.
Food Inspections
• Local health department
• Story ideas: Stadiums? Food trucks?
Housing Code Violations
• County or city has them
• Complaint driven often coming from the mayor’s “action hotline” or a
311 call.
• Story ideas: slumlords, off-campus housing, bed bugs, shadowy LLCs
State Education Discipline
• Maintains data on every licensed school personnel from bus drivers to
coaches to teachers
• Teachers who have been sanctioned – licenses revoked, suspended,
put under a consent agreement. Requires action by state board.
• Bus drivers – they may have terrible driving records
• Coaches sanctioned by the state sometimes end up as Little League
coaches

• Regulated by the state (Here’s Ohio as an example:
https://www.puco.ohio.gov/)
• Complaints about electric, gas, telephone, water, wastewater, rail and
trucking companies
Doctors
• State licensing boards provide discipline information online. Who’s
been sanctioned and for what?

problem.

potentially problem products.

Data Breaches
• No single governmental agency tracks this
• Privacy Rights Clearinghouse pulls from news accounts and other
sources to track data breaches. Most comprehensive data available.
Easy to download. https://www.privacyrights.org/data-breaches
• Great local stories – schools are lousy at keeping sensitive material
under lock and key
Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration
• Regulates trucks and buses
• Tracks crashes and takes enforcement actions
• https://nccdb.fmcsa.dot.gov/nccdb/home.aspx
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
• Tracks complaints online at www.safercar.gov
• Can search by year, make, model. Names are redacted by there is a
narrative of the problems.

• US Department of Transportation issues a monthly report (PDF,
unfortunately) of flight delays, lost luggage, bad TSA experiences,
death of animals, etc.

• https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/air-travelconsumer-reports

the airplane that landed in the Hudson River.
Nursing Homes
• https://www.medicare.gov/NursingHomeCompare/Resources/StateWebsites.html

making it public. Shows three years of inspections and fines, if
applicable.

• Tracks problems with all kinds of consumer goods.
https://www.cpsc.gov/Research--Statistics
• Unverified complaints can be found here and also, sometimes include
a company response. www.saferproducts.gov
• Good news you can FOIA for complaints. Bad news, they are redacted
by the company first.
• Complaints can be exported!
Smokers
• Virtually every state has an office that collects complaints and
violations of smoking laws. Here’s one example: http://www.smokefree.illinois.gov/complaints.htm
Disney World
• Actually, if you want to investigate Disney World’s ride safety record,
you won’t be able to through state records. But you can for fair rides:
https://www.freshfromflorida.com/Business-Services/Fairs/FairRides-Inspection
• Many states have ride-inspection programs. In Ohio, two of the
largest non-Disney amusements fall under a state law that requires
state inspections by the agriculture department. Here’s the link:

State Agriculture Departments
• Investigate an array of issues including food safety and meat
inspections
• In Ohio, the department also weirdly inspects/investigates issues
with weights and measures such as retail scanners are accurate. And
auctioneers. www.agri.ohio.gov
State licensing boards
• If a professional has a license, it is regulated by the state
• Appraisers, Realtors, social workers, veterinarians, nurses, hair
stylists and barbers, accountants, architects, funeral directors, etc.
