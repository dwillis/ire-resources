Use a formal open records requests (FOIA in federalese and in many
states) as a last resort​. I am an advocate of old-fashioned, shoe-leather, beat
reporting, and fear it is becoming a lost art. You can get a lot of information by
talking to the people who hold the records or documents you think you need. Go
talk to the custodian of the documents and others who know what is in them. This
could be the clerk of the court, city council clerk, a knowledgeable person in a
government office, and an elected official or two. Also, check out the agency’s
website to see what type of information they may already be posting. And ask if
there is a log of previous requests, to see if they already have gathered up what
you are seeking and can easily replicate it. Try to find someone who could help
you get the records you need without filing a request.Then, if you need to, follow
up with an official, written request for what you want. Get advice from the record
keepers about how to frame it so that they and you can avoid delays or denials.
Follow up! ​If you can’t get what you want informally, be sure to keep track of
your requests, and call, write, email, show up in person every few days to find out
the status of your request. Get ready to file an appeal if your request is rejected.
If your request is rejected. ​Find out ahead of time what the appeal process is,
and try to get a written and verbal explanation for the rejection. File your appeal.
Track your requests ​Know the timetable in your jurisdiction for the government
to respond to a request, understand what “respond” can mean - yes we have
your request is often considered a sufficient response - and keep talking with the
record keepers to see what can be done to speed things up.
State FOIA data base ​I developed this database with students from Marquette
University. Although somewhat dated, it gives you links to each state’s law,
timetable for responses, information on appeals and penalties.
