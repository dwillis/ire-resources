Consumer Investigations
The Ultimate Tip Sheet

2008 IRE Conference - Miami, FL
Good consumer stories use thorough reporting from documents and CAR plus looking at the
people behind them. Here are some of the basics I’ve used in researching consumer stories.

Nexis. My best Nexis moment so far was finding the criminal background of a top executive at a
home remodeling company I’ve been writing about. At first I thought it must be just someone
with the same name, but when I got his mug shot I knew it was him. An assistant statewide
prosecutor is currently coordinating possible criminal charges against the officers of the business.
Better Business Bureau. http://welcome.bbb.org/.
I usually run firms through my local Better Business Bureau to get a sense of how many
complaints they have against them. Get to know the head of your local Better Business Bureau.
Regulatory agencies. Find out what agencies regulate what you’re writing about. I’ve gotten a lot
of help from the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation on various stories. I
also discovered that Florida has an agency that regulates oranges (makes sense) when I was
writing about a citrus dealer. It turned out the agency had a file on him including a letter where
he was called an embarrassment to the industry.
Court records. Always a good source of information. I run people through Brevard County’s
online court records to see what lawsuits they have against them. I looked at the divorce records
of the citrus dealer. I also found that he had been sued by other citrus companies and prosecuted
by the state Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.
Look for good anecdotes. Find interesting people. I talked to a man who was dying from brain
cancer when he was ripped off by an unlicensed contractor selling hurricane shutters who also
happened to be one of our advertisers. For the citrus dealer story, I talked to the couple he had
sold land to on eBay for $9,200 although its appraised value was $276.
Improvise. Don’t be afraid to look at your story in a different way. I visited the stand of the citrus
dealer and became curious about the orange juice it was selling. He had asked me not to return to
his property so I asked my husband to swing by the place to pick up some orange juice after he
picked our kids up from school. According to the label, it was organic. I was suspicious of this
because of his past troubles so I figured out who regulates orange juice in Florida and asked them
about it. They paid him a visit and found that he was buying orange juice from someone else,
taking their label off and putting his on. We put a pdf on our web site of the agency’s order to
stop selling juice.

How to Tame The
Consumer Beast

2008 IRE Conference
Miami, FL
Consumer Investigations

The consumer beat is unlike no other beat – because it’s constant. Everyone is a consumer
and there is an insatiable hunger with your viewers and readers . . as well as your news
directors/editors. In many cases, reporters on the consumer beat have to juggle the daily
drive for stories as well as produce consumer investigations.
Here are a couple of points to help you . . tame the consumer beat beast . . and find the
balance . . and your sanity.
Organize . . Organize . . Organize . . .
I can’t stress the importance of this. You have to find a system that works for you.
♦ Maintain a system of daily stories – quick turns and long term. Start the process – filing
FOIA’s, gathering interviews on your long term, while you’re working your short term.
♦ Always have a “Perculating” file – keep stories perculating and pitch them ONLY when
they’re ready. Once it’s out there . . managers have a tendency to want it NOW.
♦ Organize your work so that someone else can help you . . . Those that need research,
editing, writing, etc. If you stay organized, and know what you need – it’s easy for
someone to step in and lend a hand.
♦ Organize your research/writing days vs interview days. Once you get a rhythm – you
will be more effective and manage your time better
Planning and Scheduling
Work stories ahead . . Don’t just work a week out – set up a calendar (see attached example)
that you can slot your stories weeks in advance. It helps your team to get things edited ahead
of time based on their priority; it helps show producers/EPs to know what’s coming up.
Biggest Asset – You’re not living by the seat of your pants on a daily basis – and it allows
you to have things ready to feed the daily beast – so you can be free to work on your longer
investigations.
Help to Manage the work Flow
If you have a producer – work out a system that works for you. When I worked as a
consumer producer in Florida – the reporter would work on the daily beast and I would
handle the tip line and work on longer investigations. Find the system that works for you.
If you don’t have a producer/assistant – then request a continuous stream of interns. You will
have to train each one, but they can help make calls, do online research, help write smaller
packages, help with undercover. They are a great asset – use them, teach them and you’ve
got a win . . win.

Taming those Tips:
At the end of the day, tips are your bloodline on the consumer beat – but it can be
overwhelming to manage.
Tipline -- Have an online tipline vs a phone number. Online is faster to review and identify
stories. In your online design, ask for contact information and quick summary of what story
is about – but also add mandatory topic buttons that will help you sort/manage those tips
later. i.e., car repair, car sales; contractor, AC/Heating, plumbing, etc.
It can work to your advantage later when you’re trying to define patterns for your
investigations.
Interns – This is a great place that you can use interns – to call these tipsters back and find
out more information – while you work on other things. Should be handled daily.
Volunteers – This can be a gold mine to help you handle the volume – but it’s also
sometimes a challenge to manage. The elderly are a great resource for this. Many are now
retired and want to be involved. Set up an effective team of volunteers:
♦ One Chief Volunteer – Paid position that coordinates and trains other volunteers.
♦ Volunteers – (3 or more Unpaid volunteers) Work with local groups like AARP and they
can help provide seniors who want to volunteer and get involved.
o Volunteer team should:
Review complaints
Call consumers back
Get more detailed information on problems
Contact local agencies/business to help get problems resolved.
Be a resource for the reporter to identify complaints that make good stories
Utilize Feeds/Other sources:
Consumerism is across the board. Find a feed source or other consumer sources that you can
tap into for the daily grind – but also feed your ideas for ideas for longer term investigations.
Testing. . . Testing . . Testing
Test everything from the water to toy audio levels, test products, etc. It’s a good way to
expand your story base.
Team Up and Expand Your Reach . . and Your Resources
Expand your Investigations by utilizing a partnership with newspapers and other
broadcast stations owned by your company. You can expand your resources, cut down
on cost and expand the reach of your story. We used this technique to expand our stories
for tasers malfunctioning in huge numbers, across the country . . for grocery stores
returning resold meat to the shelves; hotels that didn’t wash glasses and our latest –
restaurants that advertise low fat menus – but in reality many entre contain high calories
and high fat. We were able to hit multiple locations across the country and create
national scope and national change in some cases.

How to Dig Out Good
Stories
And Keep Your Audience
Asking for More

2008 IRE Conference
Miami, FL
Consumer Investigations

Through surveys and focus groups newspapers are learning that consumer issues are hot
topics for readers. But think about it: we are all consumers. Whether is a defective product or
a loophole in the system, consumer issues affect all of us. The beauty of covering consumer
issues is that your best sources are around you. Talk to your friends, neighbors, relatives and
co-workers. Look at consumer advocate Web sites and keep an eye on what’s going on in
government. But before you get started consider this:
Be available: Sometimes the best tips come from readers. Establish a tip line online to let
readers know you are there for them. You might need to go through a lot of bogus stuff, but it
will be a matter of time before you get some good tips.
Consumer advocates and experts: Keep constant communication with these folks including
your local consumer affairs office. These agencies take complaints from consumers and the
records will be useful as you cover stories. Other sources include: attorney general office,
consumer services at the state level, and state agencies, but also your local economics crime
division and white-collar crime investigators.
Know the problem: Sometimes consumer issues are very complicated. Perhaps you found
the existing laws don’t protect people or the issue has never been addressed. This will be a
constant challenge. Keep a dialogue with your sources because they will be the ones who can
direct you toward the right track. For example: As I was investigating a business I
discovered how a scrupulous contractor with a history of defrauding consumers had
managed to use a loophole in the system, which allowed him to operate a business by using
another licensed contractor. He was on probation at the time I was looking into his business
yet he hired a license contractor to qualify his company.
Regulate the Regulators: A lot of the best consumer protection stories come from taking a
hard look at the government agencies that are supposed to keep us safe (contractor business,
foreclosure rescue firms, nail salons, restaurants and dog kennels). Take a look at any public
records agencies keep relating to their investigations, such as inspection records. How often
do they find problems? What is their caseload? Is it so high that they are more likely to
overlook violations? In short, are they doing their jobs?
If it looks gray, move on: Don’t waste your time on what it seems to be confusing. If the
scam story is not clear chances are someone is not being honest with you. Sometimes is
better to walk away from what it seems to be a story. There are plenty of stories to go around.

Do your research: The Better Business Bureau might seem like a good resource at times, but
be aware that the BBB is a membership organization. I found that their records are not
reliable and that in many cases consumers think the BBB can help them with their problems.
The BBB is not a government agency. Look through your state’s incorporation records and
licensing agencies. Check your local or state licensing rules and databases because almost
every business needs a license. Also, keep in mind that blogs could be a source even though
their reliability is as good as the author. But most blogs provide resources so it could be a
useful tool. Use google and other searching engines to see what’s out there on the topic you
are researching.
Learn about the bad guy: Use Lexis\Nexis, criminal background check, civil lawsuits,
divorce files, corporation records of current business but other businesses he might have
owned. If he/she is out there to make a buck more than anything else, chances are that other
businesses he/she had before went through the same problems. Also, check association the
business belongs to, its competitors, including former employees and enemies.
No promises: Don’t make any promises as you begin delving into an issue. This is
something I do from the beginning. I look into the problem and I’m honest with the
caller/reader from the beginning. Sometimes you get results, but sometimes you don’t. My
job is to write the story not to work as a problem-solver or mediator.
Databases: Look locally first. The consumer affairs office might keep complaints
electronically, but you should also look at your county electronic records and then move up
to the state. Licensing, inspections, occupational licensing, state corporate records, civil
lawsuits and other electronic records are great resources when investigating an issue or
problem.
Put the data online: Say no more. Readers love to search inspections on their favorite
restaurants, pet food recall and nail salons. But don’t stop there, offer other tools to your
readers like studies you mentioned in a story and you have on a PDF format, why not post it
online too. Note: When planning to post a searching database online, you should keep in
mind the data could be dirty and it must be cleaned. Talk to the online folks to develop more
efficient ways to working together on this.
Offer a solution or useful information: When you write the story try to give something to
the reader whether is what to do if he/she is in a similar situation and where to go for help. I
try to get a tip box with each story. Sometimes is dreading, but I’ve learned to appreciate this
because it helps me to write the story. I concentrate on some areas and leave the other
information for the tip box. Try to give readers telephone numbers, Web sites and
organizations.
Looking out for the consumer: Think outside the box. Ask yourself: How can I tell this
story differently? Listen what people have to say – you’ll be surprised at what they might
offer. Once you identified what the topic/problem is, look for a consumer advocacy group.
They are everywhere. More importantly, keep an eye on government agencies because their
regulatory role is crucial on consumer stories. And hold them accountable when
government agencies are not doing their job. That’s our job.
