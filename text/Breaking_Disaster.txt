Putting it all together
Breaking news and disaster coverage

Jaimi Dowdell & Doug Haddix, IRE

Have a game plan
 Identify one person that runs the show technically
 Have another whose job it is to handle enterprise and digging

 Get them involved in preparation

 Have an emergency kit prepared – don’t waste time later

tracking down batteries, radios, water, etc.
 Have a meeting point or a call-in number (think back to
childhood)
 Send anyone who is able to cover the basics, but make sure
you have a couple of bodies digging deeper at the same time.
 Get a story up ASAP.
 Have game plan meetings at the end of each day – no matter
how tired everyone is.

Be prepared for breaking news
 Think now before you need to act.
 Identify disasters that might happen in your coverage area.
 What data and documents might help you cover that?

 What data and documents exist?
 Who is in charge in the case of a disaster (not your newsroom)
 What sites might help you track down information?

 Who are the watchdogs?

 Request your local area emergency response plan (typically

county level).
 Practice using data for breaking news before it happens.

Before the disaster
 How are warnings conveyed? Are they effective?

 Tornadoes
 How often have sirens been tested? Results?
 Where are sirens located.

 SBA Disaster loans
 See what disasters have cost the area money.
 Use this as a predictor and also follow-up.

 Floods
 When is the last time levees were inspected?
 Are the standards current – i.e. do they take into account

sprawl?

Once something has happened, what
do you do?
 Be creative.
 Ask yourself, what’s next? What do you want to know about

the situation?
 Think about angles that can help you stand apart from your
competition.
 Think about the standard. What should happen vs. reality.
 Consider watchdogs.
 Ask questions.
 Don’t necessarily follow the pack.
 Listen.

When disaster strikes (and it will)
Breaking news

A piece of an airplane falls out of the
sky and lands in a mall parking lot.

What do you do?

 What can you do now? What can you do later?
 The facts first
 Analysis second

 What do you know?
 Reports that the aircraft belonged to Atlas Air
 What resources are available?

 NTSB, FAA, NASA

FAA Accidents and Incidents data

Special thanks to Stephen Stock for his help with this example.

A dam fails washing away a family’s
home

What do you do?

Things to consider
 What is the standard? What should people reasonably expect?
 Dams shouldn’t fail.

 What is in place to keep this from happening?
 Were those regulations followed?

 Inspections can help for first day and follow-up stories
 When was the last time it was inspected? What did they find?

 Should the public be scared of other dams?

 Talk to experts in the field. If you can’t get someone locally

or in your state to give you advice, go elsewhere.

Questions to answer (breaking news
and otherwise)
 How often does this happen?
 Why is this still a problem?
 Who’s responsible for fixing this?
 What’s the fallout?
 How do we compare statewide or nationally?

Quick-hit stories

Manage your time
 ALWAYS have a story you’re excited about reporting.
 That will force you to streamline time on routine tasks.
 Write as you report.
 Get others involved.
 Ensure success with the minimum story.
 New to watchdog reporting? Start small and gain confidence.
