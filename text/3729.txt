Tip Sheet for Covering Veterans’ Issues
Investigative Reporters and Editors Conference 2012, Boston
By Michael de Yoanna, Henry Schuster and Greg Campbell
-

Don’t be an asshole. Be respectful to troops and their families and sensitive to the fact that it
can be difficult for them to talk immediately about the war, including their losses and injuries.

-

Get every piece of information you can get about the military units you are covering.

-

Strive to understand how the military works, including its jargon, expressions and acronyms.

-

Find an outside expert to help guide you.

-

Befriend journalists who report on local military communities and ask them for help navigating
areas that are new to you.

-

Don’t be afraid to be confused. Ask good questions when you don’t know something. Keep
asking questions, acquiring knowledge about military processes and culture.

-

Be patient: These men and women want to know someone is listening.

-

It can be exhausting and frustrating trying to get individual stories. You are often talking to folks
(or their families) with TBI and PTSD. They can go from clarity to paranoia in a single sentence.
It is hard for them and not too easy for you. Be prepared to put in long hours.

-

File Freedom of Information Act requests to get documents or databases.

-

Acquire relevant documents, including:
o DD214 (Defense Department document No. 214: This is the discharge document all
military troops have and it will tell you where and when someone served as well as
the nature of their discharge (i.e. honorable, bad conduct, etc.)
o Medical documents (including any military medical evaluation board paperwork and
final analyses that indicate wounds, mental and physical, and disability rating)
o Veterans Affairs records (which may challenge findings in military medical records)
o Court martial or criminal court records
o Disciplinary statements by commanders that track a service member’s questionable
conduct (i.e. “counseling statements”)
o Investigations by the military into alleged events, for instance, Army Criminal
Investigative Command documents

-

Look around you and what’s in your community. Be aware of possible stories lurking beneath
the surface of daily news reports. Connect the dots to reveal trends that impact communities
and show the hidden costs of war.

-

Don’t always assume the worst outcome. Yes, there is much reporting to be done on the themes
of homelessness, drugs, homicide, suicide and harassment of wounded soldiers by the military.
There are also many inspiring stories of veterans returning home and healing their wounds of
war, looking for jobs, writing about their experiences, running businesses, running for office,
etc.
