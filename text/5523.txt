Know your candidates.
Background your candidates. Voting records, criminal records, look at their social, past
experience. How old are they really? (Cory’s session will be great!)
Confirm oppo research before using it. (There’s more than one side to that story, but research +
better question phrasing might have avoided this Medium post.)
Collaborate/coordinate on questionnaires - and get them out early. Use them to hold candidates
accountable. Always link to them from stories to give your audience context.

Know your election laws
Types of Colorado committees:
● Candidate - second lowest limits in the nation.
● 527 - An IRS designation for a committee that takes unlimited contributions and makes
independent expenditures. They also file quarterly with the IRS.
● Independent expenditure committee (IEC) - A committee that takes unlimited
contributions and makes independent expenditures. This is basically the Colorado
equivalent of a super PAC.
● Issue committee - supports or opposes ballot measures. Takes unlimited contributions.
● Small-scale issue committee - raises or spends between $200 and $5,000 to support or
oppose a ballot measure.
● Political party - A committee representing a political party.
● Small donor committee - Accepts small donations from individuals. But they can give
larger donations to candidates.
● Political committee - Also known as a PAC or political action committee. Limits apply.
What are the contribution limits for candidates and committees? Look at the Secretary of State’s
site for how much various entities may donate and how much committees may accept.
Know committee names and types. This can be tough to track. Here are the gov race IECs from
a few weeks ago. IECs for Donna Lynne or Cary Kennedy (yes, Teachers for Kennedy)?
Campaign Finance Institute has a great tool to get your state’s data and compare with other
states. But it doesn’t include all types of committees.

Follow the money
Who is funding the candidate? Is there a super PAC/IE supporting or opposing the candidate? If

so, where is the latter’s $$ coming from?
Who are the candidates/PACs paying? Background them – what other campaigns have they
worked for?

Nonprofits

527s are political nonprofits. They file quarterly or twice a year with the IRS, all
contributions and expenses. Your state may also require reporting more frequently.
Examples include Democratic and Republican governors associations. You may search
for them here, downloadable as :( PDFs.
501(c)(4)s are the elusive ones, including Americans for Prosperity, League of
Conservation Voters, etc.
501(c)(6)s are “business leagues,” like the chamber of commerce, some professional
sports leagues.
ProPublica and Citizen Audit are also good resources for these.
