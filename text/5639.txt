“DC Police: Stop and Frisk”
Finding the Story
• Start with a question. “What’s the racial makeup of people stopped by DC
Police?”
• Report the story. “83% of police stops in Washington, DC are made on
African-Americans.”
• Go beyond the numbers. “Why are those numbers so disproportionate
when less than half of Washington, DC is black?”
• Search for an explanation to what you uncovered, and keep pulling threads
to unravel new layers of the story. “Digging deeper into the explanation
from DC Police, that they only stop people based on a suspect description,
led to new revelations during our reporting.”

Demanding Accountability
• Go out of your way to get a real response, not just a statement. “We spent
4 months trying to get an interview with the chief and were repeatedly put
off.” We delayed the release of our story multiple times and in the end,
that made our entire investigation stronger!
• Working and waiting for the interview allows you to justify unscheduled
interviews to your viewers and digital consumers. “When the police
department finally did offer a spokesperson, we checked into her record
and found she did not have the right experience to speak on the issue.”
That allowed us to continue to pursue the chief without being criticized for
“gotcha” journalism.
• When we uncovered new information, and had new questions, we went
right back to the chief for answers. “The chief said he didn’t know my name
but he was very familiar with our ‘Stop and Frisk’ reports.” We were not
going to be the bully, we were also…not going to be bullied.
