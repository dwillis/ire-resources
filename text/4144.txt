Tips for investigating caregivers
1. The best stories are like science fair projects.
Have a hypothesis. Measure something.
2. Read legal notices. There's some crazy stuff in
there
3. Donâ€™t take "No" for an answer -- if they are
denying something that should be public, they
probably have something to hide.
4. How was it supposed to work? Hospital or nursing
home charter probably doesn't say we are going to
put a vulnerable person with the mental acuity of a
3rd grader next to a guy whose punches out male
nurses and sexually assaults others.
5. Mother knows best -- find family members to talk
about what the people were like as kids. That
humanizes them so they are not just a number -shows the promise they once had. You have to make
readers care about the victims.
6. Get the salaries of the people in charge. Few
things piss off readers more than officials getting
fat off of the misery of others.
(We found record amounts of overtime.)
7. Show how others do it better. When you show a
solution, the solution seems even more egregious.
