THE OFFICIAL

reporting the story… but there will likely be a formal,
on-the-record Q&A near the end of your process.

THE OFFICIAL
INTERVIEW
You may know most of the answers
to your questions.
This is your effort to get them on the record,
to respond to what you’ve learned,
or simply ask “why?”
Set clear ground rules.

THE OFFICIAL
INTERVIEW
Prepare key questions by order of importance.
No surprises.
Be ready to present documentation.
The “unscheduled interview”

INTERVIEW

VICTIMS & “COLOR”

These are the interviews

They transform the facts of your reporting
into human stories.

VICTIMS & “COLOR”

VICTIMS & “COLOR”

VICTIMS & “COLOR”
How do you turn a line on a spreadsheet
into a human being?
Step One can be the hardest:
Find them and convince them to talk!
Then… draw out the details
that bring your reporting to life.

VICTIMS & “COLOR”

How does
it feel?

VICTIMS & “COLOR”

What’s normal like for you now?
What’s the first thing you would tell me about _______?
…

THE TIPSTER/SOURCE
These are a reporter’s dream.
Not only do they know things,
they are motivated to talk about this.
Question: What’s their angle?
Do your research/due diligence.

THE TIPSTER/SOURCE
Your source will probably know more about
the subject than you do.
Your source does not need convincing –
but needs to be fact-checked.
Find your “rabbis.”

THE TIPSTER/SOURCE

Al Tompkins – The Poynter Institute

THE TIPSTER/SOURCE

“Don’t be afraid to
ask tough questions
of your
protagonists.”

THE TIPSTER/SOURCE

“You do not do a favor to somebody
you are profiling when you do not
ask
them the tough questions that the
public would want to ask.
“The public will come to not trust
you or them.”

THE EXPERT

Why is what you uncovered important?
Can you turn your “rabbi” into an expert?
Their voice will lend weight to your reporting.

THE EXPERT

THE EXPERT
Do your homework.
What’s their bias?
Get their sources.
Experts need fact-checking, too.

OTHER THOUGHTS…

Look outside the box.
Meet in person. Meet often.
No surprises.

OTHER THOUGHTS…
TV interviews – or interviews in general – can be scary.

“It’s just a conversation.
We’re having a chat.
A very well-lit chat.”
Don’t waste their time.

OTHER THOUGHTS…

Prepare your subject for possible outcomes.
“Is there anything I didn’t ask you?”
Always make sure they understand what
“off-the-record” means – and set rules.

OTHER THOUGHTS…

Show you care.
Establish trust and respect.
“Who else should I talk to?”
