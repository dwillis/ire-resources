Testing, testing: CAR and student assessment

Sixty-two percent of fourth-grader passed the state math test. . . . The average SAT score rose
six points to 1020 . . . Forty-five percent of schools made Adequate Yearly Progress. . . . With school
test scores, it’s easy to get bogged down with numbers and neglect the details that tell the whole
story. Here are some tips for analyzing scores to see what they do – and don’t – really mean.

•

Find out how scores get reported – often, it’s in more than one way. No Child Left Behind, the
sweeping federal education law, puts the focus on passing rates. Also look for scale scores,
which are based on raw test scores and can be added, subtracted or averaged. (The range of
scale scores on the ACT, for instance, is 1 to 36). Scale scores are more detailed and often
more useful. Think of passing rates like the percent of students with at least a D average, and
scale scores like a grade-point average. You could have two schools with identical passing
rates, but one’s just squeaking by while the other’s acing the test.

•

Look at your data graphically. What’s the distribution of school test scores? Of poverty rates?
Statistical software such as SPSS does this in a snap. Excel can do it too (with the Analysis
TookPak), albeit not as easily or elegantly. One of the most common graphs is a histogram,
which shows the distribution of a single variable. This first one shows school pass rates on the
third-grade math test in Texas. See how most schools had pass rates of 80 to 100 percent.
The second histogram shows average scale scores. It has a bell-curve shape, with most
schools clustered in the middle and a few scoring very high or very low.

Why does the shape matter? Well, a bell curve indicates a “normal distribution,” which has all
kinds of nice statistical properties that lend themselves well to analysis. (For instance, the mean,
median and mode are all about the same). Say you want to compare math scores to reading
scores, to see if schools performed about the same on both.

With pass rates, most of the schools cluster in the 80 to 100 percent range, as the first chart (i.e.
scatterplot) shows. The correlation is 0.75, which is pretty darn good (0 means no correlation and 1
perfect correlation). As math pass rates rise, so do reading pass rates. Now look at the second
scatterplot, which shows math vs. reading scale scores. It’s easier to see what’s happening with
high-scoring schools, and there’s an even stronger correlation (from 0.75 to 0.84). With scale
scores, we can also see better the schools that really stand out – like the school in the upper-right
corner, which is being investigated by the state for cheating.
NOTE: You can calculate the Pearson correlation, as it’s known, in Excel too.

•

Search for context when reporting and analyzing scores. What makes high-scoring schools
different from low-scoring ones? With the SAT, a big factor is the percent of students taking
the test. With state scores, it’s often the poverty level of students, mobility rates (how often
kids change schools), teacher experience, or a combination of factors. One of the best ways to
tease out these factors is through a statistical tool called regression. A simpler way is by doing
cross-tabs like the one on the next page. It shows letter grades for schools in three Florida
counties. Schools were grouped by poverty rate – high, medium or low.

This chart shows that 82 percent of low-poverty schools received an A, but only 15 percent of
high-poverty schools received an A. Meanwhile, no low-poverty schools received a D or F,
compared to a quarter of all low-poverty schools. You could do something similar looking at
schools that made Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP).
•

Examine results over time. Any school can have a big jump in test scores from one year to the
next. Look at results over three or more years. Sometimes the school that made that big gain
one year loses a lot of ground the next.

•

Pay attention to the number of students taking the test. If only a few students take the test at
one school, one or two scores can skew the results. This chart shows the phenomenon: The
greater the number of test-takers in a school, the less swing in the results. This also goes for
looking at gains or losses from one year to the next.

•

Try different ways of reporting scores. Scale scores may be helpful for analysis, but it might
also help to explain scores as percentiles – for instance, that a school went from the bottom 25
percent of schools one year to the top 5 percent the next.

•

Check your findings with an expert, such as a professor at a local university. You want people
to poke holes in the analysis before it’s in print or on the air – not after.

•

If you’re comfortable with basic statistics, try learning regression. It lets you see the
relationship between variables – say, test scores and poverty – and make predictions based
on that relationship. With regression, you can level the playing field and see how well schools
perform after controlling for family income. To learn more, check out IRE’s online training
section at www.ire.org/training/ and click on “Practice Data Sets” (you must be an IRE member
to access that section).
