Ideas for the whole newsroom

Jaimi Dowdell, IRE
Mark Wert, The Cincinnati Enquirer

Think government agencies
 Just because you’re not covering a

government agency doesn’t mean you can’t
get data from one.
 Think creatively.
 Remember, any time a private business, a
school, etc. interacts with the gov’t a paper
trail develops.
 Treat your beat like a hard news beat – what
are the regulations, enforcements, etc.
 Retention schedules can give you ideas.
(Find your state here.)

Build your own database
 Sometimes data doesn’t already exist.
 Obtain records and combine

information.
 Uncover potential stories that no one

else is doing.

Two is usually better than one

Data meets shoe leather

Remember, documents are data
 The source of them, as long as the data

is credible and authoritative, matters
less.
 Non-public agencies and entities don’t
always say no. But first, you have to
ask.

Asked …. and answered

It’s about the money, honey

Creating a CAR environment
 Attend planning meetings.

 Be present.
 If someone is interested, follow up now.
 When breaking news happens, be

present to show the value of data.
 Offer training.

Have your whole newsroom be
ready for breaking news
 Plane crash – SDR, Aircraft Registry, NTSB

Accidents and Incidents
 Workplace accident – search OSHA records
for previous inspections and similar accidents.
 Chemical spill – Hazardous Materials (from
IRE database library)
 Bridge or dam failure – Have your state
inspection databases handy

Non-profits
 Guidestar is your friend. And your IRE

membership gets a discount on a
premium membership.
 Don’t stop with the 990s. Look at annual
reports, public debt filings, lawsuits, etc.
 After all, following the money is following
the money (no matter if it’s public,
private, non-profit, government).
