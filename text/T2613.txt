CAR after the disaster: FEMA, SBA and other data

Long before Hurricane Katrina, readers of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel were
well aware of problems at the Federal Emergency Management Agency. During
15 months in 2004 and 2005, the newspaper uncovered a trail of fraud and waste
in federal disaster aid costing taxpayers more than $530 million.
The Sun-Sentinel’s coverage focused on FEMA’s Individuals & Households Program
(IHP), which provides money to people in disaster areas for losses that are not
covered by insurance – furniture, clothing, home repair and cars, as well as disasterrelated medical, dental and funeral expenses.
The complete coverage is available online at www.sun-sentinel.com/fema and

GETTING STARTED
FEMA’s Mapping & Analysis Center www.gismaps.fema.gov is a great resource for
CAR reporters and graphics artists. Downloadable maps show estimated wind speeds
and rainfall, flooded neighborhoods, number of people in shelters, power outages,
damage estimates, etc. Don’t expect the maps to stay posted long, so save them to
your hard drive.
Check FEMA’s main web site, www.fema.gov, or the Federal Register for the
Presidential declaration and amendments. These tell which counties or what areas of
your state were declared a disaster and are eligible for assistance.
Ask FEMA for a county-by-county breakdown in your state of how much money the
agency is giving to people through its IHP. The information may be on the agency’s
web site, or may be available only by calling the main disaster assistance office and
asking for it. This will be county-level information with the number of applicants ruled
eligible and amounts paid out.

MORE DETAILED WORK
For a more detailed analysis of FEMA aid, contact the agency’s public information
office and request data from the National Emergency Management Information
System (NEMIS). Expect this request to take about four to six weeks to process.
Specifically, you’ll want records of every individual receiving money. FEMA will provide
tables of the amount paid for Housing Assistance and Other Needs Assistance (the
two main categories of aid within IHP). Also asked for records of “verified losses” –
property that FEMA inspectors verified was damaged or destroyed by the disaster. As
of now, FEMA provides this information in 12 delimited text tables that can be
imported into a database manager. FEMA will not release names and addresses of
recipients, citing privacy laws. The Sun-Sentinel and other media outlets have sued to
obtain that information and the case remains in federal court as of March 2006.
MAP IT OUT
Despite the lack of a name and address, each FEMA record includes the county and
ZIP Code where the recipient’s damaged property is located. Find the total amount for
each ZIP and map it out. Did anywhere outside of the affected area obtain a windfall?
The verified loss records are great fodder for a story. How many television sets, air
conditions, computers, washers and dryers, etc., did FEMA pay for? How many cars?
If you’re coving a hurricane, check web sites for the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, www.noaa.gov, and its Hurricane Research Division,
www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd. There you can download PDF maps and Arcview shapefiles
showing wind speeds and rainfall amounts.

DATA ALONE WON’T DO IT
Don’t expect data alone to tell the story. It’ll show where the money went and raise red
flags. But to support that theory you’ll need supporting documentation and solid
interviews:
 Damage assessments. Preliminary damage assessments are provided to
FEMA by local and state governments when they’re asking for aid. These
show how much damage local, state and federal officials estimated occurred.
 After-action reports. Local governments conduct “debriefings” of their
emergency response. These provide valuable tips on what went right and
what didn’t – and sometimes some insights into political squabbling that
might have gotten in the way of disaster assistance.
 Talk to business owners and residents. Interviews with residents provide
some of the best insight into what really happened in their neighborhood. If
fraud is widespread, they’ll know about it. Don’t expect anyone to admit to
wrongdoing, but they will offer rich detail about those who did.

BUILD DATA TOOLS
A fast way to get data to reporters is to let them run their own queries. Using
ASP.NET, the Sun-Sentinel’s CAR staff built a simple web-based search tool that
gave reporters direct access to the database and allowed them to do their own
research by county or ZIP. This allowed them to quickly pull up total dollar amounts as
well as counts of televisions, microwaves, funerals, furniture, etc. A search tool like
this has a short shelf life, but it’s well worth the time spent building it. It saved
countless hours of database and spreadsheet work.
COUNT BODIES
FEMA pays for disaster-related funeral expenses. Use FEMA’s database to look for
how many funerals and burials the agency covered. It’ll take five minutes. Compare
that with the number of deaths the local Medical Examiners attributed to the disaster.
Do they match or are they far off? After the 2004 hurricanes, the Sun-Sentinel found
that FEMA paid for more than 300 funerals while medical examiners could only link 74
to the storms. FEMA paid for people who died of cancer, AIDS, strokes and selfinflicted gunshot wounds.
THE ‘OTHR’ MONEY
FEMA’s database includes a category called OTHR, which stands for “Other Eligible
Property Items – Disaster Specific.” These are usually cleanup items or equipment
needed after the storm or flood – electric generators, chainsaws, air purifiers,
dehumidifiers, wet/dry vacuums, fuel and even cords of wood. In Florida, the SunSentinel found that this category devoured between one-fifth and one-third of the
disaster aid -- usually for electric generators. Using mapping tools and household
income data from Claritas, the newspaper showed that most of the generator money
went to middle- and upper-income areas. FEMA’s reimbursement checks were
sometimes hundreds of dollars more than what was paid for the equipment.
CHECK BACKGROUNDS OF INSPECTORS
The newspaper also found that FEMA inspectors entrusted to enter disaster victims'
homes and verify damage claims included criminals with records for embezzlement,
drug dealing, robbery and other crimes. This story was labor-intensive, timeconsuming, and a pricey endeavor. Neither the companies nor FEMA would provide
the names of the inspectors.
The newspaper gleaned the names of over 100 from confidential sources, web sites,
aid applicants, and news stories. Using Accurint, Nexis and AutoTrack we obtained
addresses, phone numbers, names of relatives etc., and kept track of it all in an Excel
spreadsheet.
