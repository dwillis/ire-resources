What is investigative reporting?
Consumers are passionate, descriptive and verbose!

What is investigative reporting?
“When I think of investigative reporting, I think of programming
that will take a specific topic and expose everything about it that
has been discovered (or uncovered) based on tangible,
empirical, or other trustworthy evidence. I would characterize
investigative reporting as reporting that is objective at its best
and alarmingly effective in swaying an audience if the reporting
is biased. Investigative reporting can be explosive because
‘truth’ often is. Investigative reporting can give fire to
controversy or deflate it and can be used on any topic.” – Female,
50-54

“It is the cornerstone of the free press. It should be what keeps
our government honest no matter what party is in office and the
same with private business.” – Male, 55-64

What is investigative reporting?
“I think it's one of the main purposes of journalism. Journalism
is more than just saying what happened, it's putting things into
context, making connections to similar occurences in the past,
not taking things at face value.” – Female, 35-44
“I see it as finding out about something going on that should be
reported and investigated. Going undercover, investigating and
tearing the lid off of a previously unknown problem in your local
city or even globally. Not everyone is good at this kind of
reporting. You HAVE TO BE A VERY TRUSTWORTHY PERSON
AND PEOPLE NEED TO BE ABLE TO BELIEVE YOU.” – Female,
35-44

Simply put… “Verify, research, test, prove, report.” – Female, 35-44

Essentially, investigative is…
• “Bringing to light information that could go under
the radar of the average citizen”

• Conducting “a sniff test and then digging if
something smells”

• A credible, trustworthy reporter asking the right
people the right questions

• Uncovering hard facts / fact-checking
• Ideally, it is… “Stop what you’re doing material.”

What it is NOT…
• Biased/Partisan
• Opinion-based “witch hunts”
• Sensational (“Often lacking in fact, but replete with
drama.”)

• Overtly Ratings/Subscription-driven
• “Clandestine or insidiously hidden, disguised,

manipulated, propagandized and conjured to
mislead certain individuals, groups and the public.”

“What would you tell a news
organization to do differently or
better when it comes to investigative
reporting, given your outlook?”

Consistent Themes Emerged…
• “Pick issues that can have a positive effect on the

community when the information is brought to light.”
• “1. Stop being biased. Present all sides-fairly. 2. Stop covering
bullshit that really does not matter. 3. Stop pulling punches,
especially when it comes to politicians and cops. 4. be
passionate, but be fair and bring things out to their logical
conclusions. Clearly differentiate between the facts and your
opinions. Basically, follow journalism and research
methodology 101.”
• “Get both sides of the story, and follow-up with what has
taken place to resolve the problem. It always seem to be big
headlines in the beginning, then it falls off the chopping
block.”

injustice where it lurks in the back alleys. To effect positive
change. Give me news that accomplishes that.”

Can Crowdsourcing help?
• Crowdsourcing – “soliciting information and help from people
potentially impacted by an event triggering an investigation.”
• 32% of news consumers say they are familiar with
Crowdsourcing (mostly 25-34 year olds, urban, Liberal)
• 44% of news organizations use Crowdsourcing at least
occasionally
• The practice benefits news gathering efforts, but has little
impact on improving consumer opinion of news
organizations.

What is fact-checking?
• This is NOT about perceived inaccuracy in the media.
• It’s cutting through the spin to separate…
ü Fact from Fiction
ü Truth from Rumor
ü Reality from Myth

Consumers speak out…
“Investigative reporting is critical, however a couple things are
very important to its effectiveness: presenting problems AND
some solutions and presenting REAL issues, not just trendy
concerns. I believe an outlet should also fact check, fact check
and fact check some more!”
“Digging into the heart of the issue. Beyond the fluff or the
spin that the PR person wants you to see - the actual facts.”
“‘Transparency’ has become opaque.”

The Takeaways
• Investigative Reporting is high value content.
• A strong investigative focus can build trust and drive
consumer behavior.

• Consumers continue to place emphasis on the media's role as

a government watchdog at all levels - local, state, and federal

• News organizations recognize the value of investigative but

dramatically underestimate the importance of fact-checking.

• Effective IR should:

ü Strive to champion a resolution, solution or positive outcome
ü Include regular follow-ups
ü “Fact check, fact check and fact check some more”
ü Be “stop what you’re doing material”

Can investigative! journalism save
your newsroom?

We leave you with !
this thought from a consumer…

“It is the area of journalism that provides unique,
lasting, and maximum value to society. It connects
the dots, follows information, and uncovers new
information outside the purview or ability of other
individuals or organizations.” – Male, 35-44
