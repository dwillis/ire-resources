YOU’VE WORKED HARD ON YOUR INVESTIGATION, GET IT READ!
HOW TO CREATE A MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION PLAN
Once you’ve determined which platforms would be most effective for reaching your
audience, you need a distribution plan. For large-scale enterprise and watchdog pieces,
more formal and advanced planning is required. Here is a checklist to give you an idea
of what kind of planning needs to be done.
Distribution checklist:
• Have you established who the intended audience is?
• Is the story framed appropriately for that audience?
• Do you know how the intended audience consumes and engages with media?
• Based on their media habits, have you decided which platforms to promote your
investigation on? Do any of the platforms require advance set-up? (i.e. Facebook
Live, Snapchat, etc.)
• Have you double checked the SEO on the story BEFORE publishing?
• Search headline or Meta title: roughly 65 characters
• Summary: 1 to 2 sentences packed with keywords
• Keywords: 8-10, with a maximum of 25.
• Is the story packaged appropriately for the audience and the platform?
• Does the headline leave a curiosity gap? Is it interesting and easy to
understand?
• Is the photo eye-catching? Is it cropped well for the social media
package?
• Have you drafted conversational share text options for Facebook and/or
Twitter and/or Instagram? Does it preserve the curiosity gap in your
headline? Have you embedded any tweets into the story as pullouts?
• Are there aggregators that you can send this story to? If so…
• Have you created a list of local and/or national websites and
organizations to pitch the story to? Do you have their e-mail address or
do they have a Facebook page you can message?
• Are there influencers on Twitter who would like to read and share this
story? Are you prepared to tweet it to them or tag them in a tweet?
Show off your expertise
• Reddit AMA’s are great for watchdog and investigative stories if your reporters
have expertise over the subject that few others have, or if they have unique
insight into the topic.
