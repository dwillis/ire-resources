Investigating Inequality // IRE 2018

Helpful databases to mine for stories:
1. Home Mortgage Disclosure Act Data​​ -- Mortgage data includes race and ethnicity of applicant
and co-applicant, includes the location of the property.
a. The ​Consumer Financial Protection Bureau​ has a helpful portal for the data.
Reveal broke down​ the lending patterns for every lender in every metro and every census tract in the
country by applications, loans and denials for race/ethnicity. The ​Spotlight team used the data​ to reveal
how few mortgages were approved for black residents within Boston’s newest, fast-developing
neighborhood, the Seaport.
2. National Center for Education Statistics​​ -- A treasure trove of education data, but especially
race and gender statistics for both students and educators in K-12 and college institutions across
the country.
The Spotlight team explored ​how international student enrollment has exploded​, while the percentage of
black students has largely stagnated at many elite universities.
3. Stanford Open Policing Project​​ -​​ Traffic stops by law enforcement agencies across the country.
Multiple outlets -- such as ​The Los Angeles Times​ -- have used this database to show the disparities
between races for traffic stops in their area. Also ask your local police departments for your area’s own
data, which can go by various names: The Boston Police Department, for example, calls them ​Field
Interrogations and Observations, or FIOs.
4. US Census​​:​ Mine these statistics, which include race, household income, and education level, to
show segregation in your neighborhood, among other issues. Is there a neighborhood that has
rapidly changed over time? Show the numbers.
The Spotlight team ​used the data to show how few census tracts​ in the area include a large number of
highly-educated black families who make at least the median income, a proxy for a strong black middle
class.
5. Transportation statistics through the​ A
​ merican Community Survey​​ and your local transit
agencies.
The US Census American Community Survey includes ​commute times as part of its data​, and several
studies have shown that ​black residents often have the longest commutes​, which has a ​big impact on
people’s lives​. Ask your local transit agencies about whether they collect information on the demographics
of subway, bus, and train lines, and ​figure out which ones get the best service​.
6. Find your local civil rights organization and look through complaints.

Find out what institutions and companies in your area have some of the most complaints. At the
Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination​, you can request closed cases. Other states may
allow you to get statistics of open cases.
7. Create your own surveys/tests for housing discrimination or job discrimination.
Many studies have already been done about how black job or housing applicants get fewer chances,
compared to white applicants. Many organizations that focus on housing also conduct “fair housing” tests.
Consult with academics who have done similar studies to produce your own. The Spotlight team ​tested
more than 600 ads on Craigslist in a certain area​ by sending out emails from “black-sounding” and
“white-sounding” names, and found a disparity in the responses.
8. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission​​ ​and ​Bureau of Labor Statistics
The EEOC has historical data that it breaks out by race in various industries. The data allows you to see
the differences in jobs among different races and genders. The Bureau of Labor Statistics also has
historical data within industries.
9. Gallup
Polling organizations often conduct regular surveys on ​such issues as race relations​. In 2017, for
example, they wrote about how ​black people rated their life satisfaction lower than whites, Asians, and
Hispanics have​.
