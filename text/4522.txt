Muni Bonds:
Why Do We Care?

Why Do We Care?
• Governments borrow to build our
essential infrastructure through
the $3.6 trillion muni bond market:
– Schools, universities
– Government buildings
– Water and sewer systems
– Roads, bridges, highways
. . . and much more

Taxonomy:
Types Of Muni Debt
6/6/2015

IRE 2015 | Philadelphia

7

Types Of Muni Debt
• Government bonds come in
three major flavors:
– General obligation debt
– Revenue-backed bonds
– Short-term borrowings

• And indirect ways to borrow:
– “Moral obligation bonds”
– Bond guarantees
6/6/2015

IRE 2015 | Philadelphia

8

Types Of Muni Debt
General obligation bonds
• Debt backed by the taxing
power of the governments
that issue them – aka
“full faith and credit”
• Obligation to raise taxes
to make up any shortfall
• Lower risk, lower interest
rates

6/6/2015

IRE 2015 | Philadelphia

9

Types Of Muni Debt
Revenue-backed bonds
• Debt backed by a specific
revenue source, like tolls
from a toll road
• No obligation to raise
taxes to make up any
shortfall – “nonrecourse”
• Higher risk, higher
interest rate

6/6/2015

IRE 2015 | Philadelphia

10

Types Of Muni Debt
Short-term borrowings
• Cash management tool:
bridges gap between when
government needs cash
and when it receives it
• Known as “tax and
revenue anticipation
notes” or TRANs
• Typically due in less than
one year, pay short-term
interest rates
• General obligations
6/6/2015

IRE 2015 | Philadelphia

11

Types Of Muni Debt
“Moral obligation bonds”
• Issuer has authority to
ask the government to
make appropriation to
cover debt service in case
of a shortfall
• Government has a “moral
obligation” to honor the
request
• Not a legal obligation

Types Of Muni Debt
Bond guarantees
• Government promises to
make good on the debt by
whatever means necessary
to make sure bondholders
get repaid in full
• Lowers the risk for the
bondholders, taxpayers on
the hook to if anything
goes wrong

Bond guarantees
– The legalese leaves little to imagination:
“Under the City Bond Guaranty, the City has
unconditionally guaranteed, for the benefit of the
registered owners of the 2003 Bonds, the full and
prompt payment of principal and interest on the
2003 Bonds when due according to the terms of the
City Bond Guaranty, for which obligation the City
has pledged its full faith, credit and taxing power.”

Say Hello To EMMA
• What is EMMA?
– Electronic Municipal Market Access

• Since 2009, the official repository
for muni bond offering documents
and continuing disclosures
• Run by the Municipal Securities
Rulemaking Board (MSRB)

• Official statements; ongoing financial
disclosures; advance refunding documents;
event notices, voluntary disclosures, and more

Say Hello To EMMA
• What’s an “official statement”?
– It’s these documents I keep linking to all
over the place in this presentation!
– Think of them as the prospectus for the
bond issue: they’re supposed to tell
investors all the key things they need to
know before buying the bonds
– This is your starting point for
understanding the debt

Say Hello To EMMA
• Tips for reading official statements
– First two to four pages always contain all the key
numbers – amounts sold, when they’re due,
interest rates, CUSIPs, key terms and conditions
• Some bonds will also contain a “summary” official
statement, which is good to skim also

– Other things you should look for:
• “Sources and Uses” table – ALWAYS read this
• Security and sources of payment for bonds
• Subordination and payment priority
• Optional redemption features

What exactly is a ‘bond issue’?
• Bonds issues are chunks of
debt sold together
• An issue can have many
different tranches with
different characteristics
• Each tranche can have
multiple bonds, each with
its own CUSIP

– Use this California GO bond issue:
• CUSIP: 13063A7D0

– Enter in the inputs values to calculate the
coupon, initial yield and market yield
– Use data from official statement and the
latest trade available on EMMA

How Much Do We Owe?
• There are two ways bonds repay
interest to bondholders:
– Current interest bonds
– Capital appreciation bonds
(aka “zero coupon bonds”)

6/6/2015

IRE 2015 | Philadelphia

32

How Much Do We Owe?
Current interest bonds
• Bonds that make periodic
cash interest payments to
bondholders over the life
of the bonds
• The interest rate sets the
coupon, or how much
investors get each period
• This is how most bonds
are sold in muni market

California GO bond we looked at before:

close attention to first two pages!
– Hint 2: Check the official statement for
sinking fund payments

35

How Much Do We Owe?
Capital appreciation bonds
• Capital appreciation bonds do
not pay annual cash interest
• Instead, interest grows on the
original principal and
accumulating balance until it
comes due, often decades in the
future
• Can easily turn small sums
borrowed into hundreds of
millions, or even billions owed
• Get the cash now, let future
generations worry about paying
it back

• The power of compound interest – take
Ohio’s tobacco CABs as an example:
– Series 2007B: $191.3m borrowed, $3.2bn due
at maturity in 2047.
• Interest accrues at 7.25% interest rate

– Series 2007C: $128.2m borrowed, $3.4bn due
at maturity in 2052.
• Interest accrues at 7.5% interest rate

• What officials are saying:
“CABs are – for good reason – known as a distinctly
horrible means of public finance. They are bad
policy. Everybody knew it then, everybody knows it
now. But that's the situation that we've inherited.”
- Andrew Sidamon-Eristoff, New Jersey State Treasurer, April 1, 2014

How Much Do We Owe?
• When do investors get repaid?
– Bondholders don’t always have to wait until
maturity to get their money back
– Issuers typically reserve right to “call” the
bonds ahead of their final maturity
• Repay bondholders today at a specified price,
usually above or below par value

– Beneficial to issuers – like having ability to
refinance mortgage when interest rates fall:

How Much Do We Owe?
• What exactly is ‘par value’?
– Generally speaking, it’s the amount due at
maturity – i.e. when principal is due

• So is ‘par value’ same as principal?
– Not always.
• Capital appreciation bonds are sold at a
discount to par value and earn interest
(“accrete”) until they grow into the par amount
• Current interest bonds are typically sold at par
value, so principal and par will be the same

View It In Context
• The importance of benchmarking
– How much interest is more than the norm? Well,
it depends:
• What time horizon are we talking about?
• How creditworthy is the issuer?

– So what you need are:
• The term (“tenor”) of the bonds you’re looking at
• The credit ratings (“AAA”, “BBB+” etc.) of the issuer

– These allow you to make an apples-to-apples
comparison against a benchmark borrowing rate

• What benchmark should I use?
– MMD curves are a good one

• What are they?
– Generic yield curves that represent
borrowing costs for issuers based on tenor
and credit quality

• What do they look like?

to borrow if you’re Illinois vs. Texas:

• What does this look like in print?
– Here is an example of how I used MMD curves
to benchmark borrowing costs in one story:
“Buried in Appendix G of the 416-page bond prospectus was
the amount due at maturity: $6.8 billion, including $593
million for Niagara's bonds. The hefty payoff was made
possible by interest rates that ranged from 6 to 7.85 percent
for the riskiest CABs, due in 2060. The top rate was nearly
double that for long-term, taxpayer-backed municipal debt
at the time, according to Thomson Reuters data.”
