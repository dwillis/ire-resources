FIND YOUR NICHE IN THE NEW MEDIA WORLD
Forget "Freelance", the term is DEAD, you are an Independent Journalist. Don't let clients, sources,
PAOs/flaks treat you different.
National / Local / Specific Beats
‐ Be a specialist, exploit your specialty beats
‐ Break News ‐ Break it first, break it fast
‐ Exclusivity/Original Investigative Content Sells, It's a Commodity.
‐ Protect your sources ‐ they're your lifeblood. Even from "partners".
‐ Start at the top of any news org ‐ everybody has a boss
‐ Your services are what you are selling ‐‐ not your stories
‐ Exploit your INDY STATUS, do what any single MSM cannot do. Offer your sources multiple outlets.
Broker your services, know where to place the story (repackage/repurpose for different mediums,
outlets)
THE TWO HATS ‐ JOURNALIST AND BUSINESS PERSON
‐ You are the company, act like one, don't be bullied or shy, stand firm with the big MSM boys
‐ Have a d/b/a; explore LLC's or Inc.
‐ Always limit overheard costs, but when it's cost‐effective and R‐O‐I warrants it, spend your own money
(OWN IT))
‐ Have people you can turn to for whatever you need production‐wise (barter, trade)
‐ Always retain ownership, only provide "teaser/samplers", enough to get your story noticed or "Green
lighted' from revenue sources.
‐ Find someone you can trust and work with them and know WHO controls the purse strings and who
doesn't. EDITORIAL decisions are NOT BUSINESS decisions.
‐ Get it writing and never trust anybody until they've earned it. Contracts/email can save you.
Spell it all out, be upfront, be direct, and be honest.
CREATE YOUR OWN OUTLET
‐ News web site, blog and/or personal website.. Know what you are: Online News Site, Blog or Personal
site?
‐ LEVERAGE your outlet against the competition. USE it to make MONEY.
‐ Use it to generate buzz, interest and eyeballs for you and your work

‐ Give it away for FREE (what is on your website) but DEMAND and GET proper attribution and credit.
(CreativeCommons/Copyright/Fair Use)
‐ Push your stories to targeted outlets, PR your stories, and submit/win J‐awards.
‐ Link in ‐‐ Link Out
‐ Build your own brand, rep and build your audience
GETTING PAID/MAKING MONEY
‐ Know the going rates for your job/services (national, local, internet, broadcast, print, online) have a
day, hour, week rate.
‐ Know the VALUE (shop it around) of Exclusive material/info.
‐ ALWAYS make the deal FIRST and neg. price before you do anything else.
‐ Be prepared to threaten, cajole and if need be sue if you have to, if someone rips‐off your work. It will
happen, there are unethical people out there. This is a business #1.
‐ Find creative ways to repurpose your work (SELL CONTENT) Video, pictures, public documents,
expertise. Develop revenue sources wherever they may be.

So, you've been laid off, seen the writing on the wall, and decided you need to take your journalistic
destiny in your own hands, now what?
GOING OUT ON YOUR OWN:
YOU ARE THE BRAND
‐ Designing your personal website‐ Domain Name; GoDaddy.com
‐ Template ie. Square Space, Wordpress
‐ Business Cards: you can get them for free
‐ Ie. VistaPrint
‐ Business Email
‐ Often, Website templates offer this
‐ Choose a branded name on gmail; yahoo; etc
WHERE ARE THE MARKETS?
‐ Wherever there were cuts, there is a market
‐ Foreign Affairs
‐ Investigative
‐ Hyper local/community news
‐ Everywhere bureaus have been shut down & news organizations have cut costs in terms of coverage
PURCHASING EQUIPMENT
‐ Learn to Love the Mac
‐ If you're going to go multimedia, this computer has the edge on products and software that will be a
one‐stop shop for all photo, video, and audio editing
‐ For a subscription fee, Mac also gives classes at its stores on how to edit video ‐ take advantage!
‐ Format Compatibility and Interchangeability
‐ Hard Drive
‐ SD Card
‐ Don't forget ‐ they are all tax write‐offs, so keep the receipt

NAVIGATING THE RATE MINE FIELD
‐ Keep track of your expenses to produce the story
‐ Know your hourly rate
‐ Know the value of what you have
‐ Understand no one knows what's fair & everyone will low‐ball you
‐ Weigh the audience against the compensation: sometimes you need a lot of people to read the story
to build up your brand, sometimes you just need the revenue
PLANNING THE FOREIGN REPORTING TRIP:
‐ Gaining access: you can get credentialed as a freelancer. There are also non‐profit war reporting
entities, such as Public Multimedia Inc. that sometimes sponsor freelance reporters and researchers
‐ Expect to front all or most of the costs of going, though you can try to get each client to cover certain
expenses.
‐ Borrow/barter for backpacks, sleeping bags, etc.
‐ But if you're going to a war zone, invest in a good flack jacket and helmet ‐ it's required.
‐ Get geared up: the more media platforms you can service, the better chances of making the trip turn a
profit.
‐ Approach different non‐competing entities, ie. commercial radio, public radio, magazines, newspapers,
online sites
HOW TO PITCH ACROSS MEDIA PLATFORMS:
‐ Identify the angles: travel audience, arts audience, hard news audience, feature audience
‐ Find the outlets that cater to those audiences
‐ Do the homework so you can tailor your pitches to them, ie. read/consume their product
‐ If it's a dynamic situation, like war, or disaster recovery, record everything on audio and or video so
you can sell it separately or a la cart. Web clients are always looking for additional interviews, great
video, or exclusive access to newsmakers. Often the video will make more money than the article. And
you can always use the audio from the video to
‐ My most profitable day in Afghanistan last year was an exclusive visit with General McChrystal during
his assessment phase, I sold 10 minutes of exclusive video to a television network, reported stories for
commercial radio, and had the front page of the Washington Times the next day, with my still
photograph.

1. SO YOU LOST YOUR JOB? WHAT NOW? IS NOT THE END OF THE WORLD. TAKE A BREAK IF YOU CAN
AND PLAN YOUR NEXT STEP.
‐Talk to other independent journalists and strategize
‐revamp your resume
‐exploit your skills, ie. computer‐assisted reporting skills, research and writing.
‐Put your name on freelance specialty databases, EWA, SEJ and NAHJ has some of those if you are a
member of a group ask if they have such databases.
2. BUILD RELATIONSHIPS WITH ASSIGNMENT EDITORS, EDITORS and PUBLISHERS
‐Go back to your sources ‐‐don't be afraid to ask for favors, i.e., logo for a new company
3. INVEST ON EQUIPMENT: HEADSET, WORKING SPACE, A BIG MONITOR AND A GOOD CHAIR.

4. HOW MUCH IS YOUR WORK WORTH? IT DEPENDS ON THE PUBLICATION. ASK AROUND, JOIN
SOCIAL NETWORK SITES AND THEIR SPECIALTY GROUPS SUCH AS LINKEDIN ‐‐SEEK FEEDBACK FROM
THOSE FOLKS.
‐Use social networking tools to promote your work besides your web site or blog.
‐Take time to talk to other independent journalists who have been doing this longer than you.
‐Don't be afraid to collaborate on big projects with startups...call them and offer your skills. It's all about
building relationships.
5. EXPLORE OTHER AVENUES RATHER THAN JOURNALISM. FOR EXAMPLE, I'M CURRENTLY ATTENDING
A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATORS TRAINING/INTERNSHIP PROGRAM. YOU'LL LEARN NEW SKILLS AND
PEOPLE AND YOU NEVER KNOW IF THAT WILL LEAD YOU TO NEW OPPORTUNITIES.
