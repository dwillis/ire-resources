Go to the courthouse and dig up whatever documents are available on the case you’re
looking at. Look for any transcripts of any depositions, hearings, trials.
Check out appeals courts, too. Who knows? You may find evidence there that’s survived
for decades.
If the case was investigated by the FBI or other law enforcement officials, request those
records from the agencies.
Read microfilm of newspaper accounts, and scour for any publications, including
magazines and self-published books. Do they give you any leads you need to pursue?
Begin to develop the case in your mind. How does it fit together? What pieces are
missing?
Do a second sweep for any additional records. Was the person convicted in other cases?
What do those cases show? What about divorce records? Ex-spouses sometimes make
great sources ready to tell all.
What about civil records? Lawsuits? Liens? Financial records? Partners?
Go through a university to search through papers and theses that students and professors
have written on the subject.
Track down and interview possible witnesses. Don’t forget that a friend from yesteryear
is sometimes an enemy today.
Talk with the targets of your investigation. You’ll be surprised how many people end up
giving you the very information that hangs them.
Still running into nothing but deadends? Work the edges and see if they don’t lead you
back to the middle.
