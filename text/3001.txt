It’s no desk job …

Time to invest:
• The usual: digital recorder, digital camera,
high-meg flash drives, etc..
• But the military does its work outdoors:
Good boots, sleeping bag, a very DURABLE
computer bag, flashlight, all-in-one tool,
Swiss Army knife, binoculars … you get
the idea.

From the Shadows, The Ultimate Insider's View of Five Presidents and
How they Won the Cold War

• Asking questions; quarreling with conclusions; sending
the researchers back for more data, more evidence;
seeking out new and different sources of information
probing and listening o obscure and not-so-obscure
outside experts; quizzing anyone who seemed to have a
good idea; reaching out to businessmen with
international experience. ...looking for new information
and insights, being willing to question... own
assumptions ...and always challenging conventional
wisdom...information and analysis that informed or
provoked action ... not ... assessments that simply were
'interesting' or educational

Delays impeded implementation of air defense system
prior to 9/11
Michael Fabey of Aerospace Daily and Defense Report
writes that the inability of the Pentagon and Canadian
defense officials to keep a lid on costs and schedules
may have cost them the opportunity to modernize their
radar-based air defense system in time to possibly
thwart the terrorist from completing their 9/11 attacks.

The real cost

Ground operations costs taking toll
on other DOD accounts, analysis shows
Funding ground wars in Iraq and Afghanistan
is starting to take its toll on other
Pentagon weapons expenses - particularly
for aircraft accounts - according to an
analysis of recent Defense Department
contracts by Aerospace Daily.
The Pentagon has concentrated its
funding more recently on equipment and
operations that support combat troops such as logistics, trucks and telecommunications,
the analysis shows. A year ago,
the Defense Department spent more
money on aircraft and related expenses.
But a common theme for 2005 and up to
August, 2006, is the need for logistics and
related costs, according to the analysis of
about 1.5 million contracts and related
modifications identified as DOD work.
Aerospace Daily gleaned the Pentagon
purchasing records…

SPOTLIGHT: MILITARY MANEUVERS
Tracking problems
with U.S. sky spies
By Mike Fabey, Aviation Week
Space proved to be – if not the final
frontier, certainly a new one – for the
military trade publication Defense
News.
The newspaper, where I recently
worked as a reporter, had blanketed
other military programs, but never
those in space. Our editors decided to
change that and assigned me to dig
up what I could on Pentagon-related
space programs.

The $69 billion contractor – not
-- about $69 billion of those $70 billion went to a
small Pittsburgh-based company called Earth
Savers Inc., the records showed.
And the total all really centered on one contract
worth about 99 percent of the total, the records
showed.
Turns out the records were wrong.
Apparently … someone at DOD inadvertently
moved a decimal point over a few places,
making a contract with tens of billions instead of
single-digit millions.

Writing: A Spartan approach
• Why do you give such a long introduction
to a small matter?
• Express a wide range of ideas in just a few
words.
• Penetrate to the heart of the matter, make
forcible impression on the hearers’ minds.
• Stranger, you meet the need, but at
endless length.

Parting thoughts
• Even a rock will crumble – if you sack it
night and day …
• Good reporting aids public understanding.
• Babe Ruth struck out nearly twice as many
times as he knocked one out of the park.
