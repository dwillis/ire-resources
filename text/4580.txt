• We requested gross pay received by Nidal Hasan from
2009-April 2013 and discovered he had collected more
than $278,000 while he sat in jail awaiting trial and
victims were struggling. Under the Military Code of
Justice, a salary cannot be suspended until they are
proven guilty.
• Request took about two months

MILITARY INVESTIGATION

COUNTY RECORDS
• Bell County Jail records showed costs of jailing Hasan
were about $540,000 (June 2013).
• Most of that cost -- about $472,000 -- was for security. It
includes overtime pay for staff members assigned to
Hasan's area of the jail.
• Inmate requests: after the trial, Bell County released 21
handwritten requests showing the types of things Hasan
had requested during his time there. It gave a glimpse
into his world.

THE CHALLENGES WE ENCOUNTERED:
• Convincing soldiers who encountered problems
to speak publicly
• Working with soldiers dealing with PTSD
• Lack of video
• The long wait for records
• Getting appropriate person with Army to go on
camera

MILITARY INVESTIGATION
Accessing people when you’re not a Pentagon reporter!
• Request to speak to everyone: Base Commanders,
Division Command, Col Commander, Army Surgeon
General
• Start from the bottom and work you way up

MILITARY INVESTIGATION
RESULTS:
• Army Training Order issued nine days after reports came
out…specifically focusing on issues raised in our reports

• Col. Toner testifies at a House Armed Services Committee hearing
mentioning our reports and reporter by name
• 15-6 Investigation at Fort Hood’s WTU (Fact Finding Investigation)
• House Armed Services Committee orders sweeping investigation of
all Army WTUs

MILITARY INVESTIGATION
TIPS FOR FILING A MILITARY FREEDOM OF
INFORMATION ACT:
Know who the record keepers are.
– If you send a request to the general Army FOIA, PREPARE
TO WAIT MONTHS—EVEN MORE THAN A YEAR!
– Find out what specific office is the keeper of the records. It
will save time.
– Don’t let FOIA officer scare you away from your request.
Feel them out see if there’s ways to narrow your request
vs. letting them dictate to you what THEY want to give you.

MILITARY INVESTIGATION
RECORDS TO ASK FOR IN YOUR SHOP:
Military Service Records:
-This is probably one of the first places we go to check
out a soldier’s story. When you’re covering big stories
this is a great place to check their service record and
honors received.
-Great for breaking news background. EX: Navy Yard
Shooting, 2nd Fort Hood Shooting, Terrorist arrested in
Texas had military ties.
