Reporting Border Stories
Morgan Loew/CBS 5 Phoenix

The border is everywhere
Deportations affect people and communities across the country


TRAC Immigration is a great place to see who is living in your community, where they are from
and where they are being deported to: http://trac.syr.edu/immigration/

ICE agents make mistakes




Seek out immigrants and citizens who were wrongfully detained
Look into the tactics ICE agents use to track down the people they are looking for
Immigration attorneys have names and contact information

Entire populations of people are now living in the shadows


Look for the people who are afraid to leave their homes

Reporting at the border
Do your homework before you go!







Border security reports:
DEA Drug Threat Assessment
Government Accountability Office
CBP Border Security Report
Look for useful NGOs:
Kino Border Initiative
Humane Borders
Derechos Humanos
Contact local reporters
They are incredibly useful as local sources
Know the lay of the land
Study Google maps, orient yourself to landmarks
Always know how to get back to the border

Humanize the numbers



They’re not statistics, “aliens” or immigrants. They are people!
Tell their stories.

Show the impact on border communities


“Big Brother” always watching




Reduced privacy
Border Patrol checkpoint hassles

Take the viewer someplace new




Get your hands dirty
Be the “tour guide”
Don’t be afraid to write and present in “first person”

Travel off the beaten path



Go where the story is
Go where the other journalists don’t often go

Go past the ride-along




Ride-alongs are useful, but the real story is “out there,” not in a cop car
See it for yourself, show it to the viewers
Always roll in dicey situations

Get the real story




There are so many misconceptions about the border
Look for ways to show a popular belief is a misconception
Tell the story in a way other reporters are not telling it

Look for the story that’s hiding in plain view







There are often parallel universes on the border
Expose the one regular people can’t see
Smugglers
Bad doctors
Sex trafficking
Bring back the bonus story

Don’t give up




Sometimes the great stories take time and repeated effort
Work on them when you have time on the side
Use some tools at hand that don’t require you to go to the border

Parting thoughts




The border is a big story. Get all of the sides
Don’t fall for easy popular misconceptions. Get the real story
Make it visual. Use creative storytelling. Make it exciting!
