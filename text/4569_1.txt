‘Crude does not blow up’
Ed Burkhardt, Chairman of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway Inc.
June 18, 2013

How did we approach the story?
• This had never happened before
• Was it a once-in-a-lifetime freak accident
or a harbinger of things to come?

Investigation: Step 1
What matters? Figure out the Red Herrings

• Human Error
• Unreliable Information from crash site
• Derailment statistics when numbers can
mislead
• The rail car debate

Investigation: Step 2
Build your case

• ‘Crude does not blow up’
• … Well it just did, so what went wrong

Investigation: Step 2 continued
Put the oil on trial

• Cast a wide net on scientific experts.
• Stress test that information.
Rule out the bad info.
• Regulatory Documents - find out if past
problems existed (H2S).
• Talk to people who handle the oil.
Anecdotes are evidence.

Investigation: Step 3
Split Hairs

• Q: Is the oil tested?
• A: Yes.
• Q. Is the oil always tested?
• A: No

Investigation: Step 4
Look for significance
Despite the boom in shipments:

• no change in regulatory oversight
• no rules on how the trains were
handled or built
• no plan for emergencies (ERAPs)

Investigation: Step 5
Where does the story go from here
• More accidents will happen.
• Oil that exploded in North Dakota in early
May had been treated.
• The situation is not necessarily under control.
• Don’t lose focus (Red Herrings).
