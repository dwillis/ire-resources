Ask to see previous sting video cops have recorded to learn whether the quality of the
video on their next sting will be acceptable for your purposes.
Consider using cop recordings from previous stings in your stories or as website sidebars.
You can use it to show a little history of how cops are work, or to demonstrate the variety
of stings they do, or reference a story people may recall (‘these are they guys who caught
that serial carjacker’). You can build an entire segment out of it showing who the cops
are/what they do and use it to tease to their next big operation that you are covering.
Try to record police radio talk either by adding equipment to the police set up or by
recording it from a surveillance car.
Don’t worry if you can’t plan ahead on ride-along shoots. Just call various days and times
to find out what’s going on, invite yourself and be ready to shoot on the fly.
You’ll need “reality” b-roll of cops and suspects: shoot staff meetings, the team having
lunch in a restaurant, the undercover cop calling informants and setting up deals, cops
debriefing after an event, pov video driving around suspect neighborhoods, rendezvous
points and the sting location.
Carry a tiny consumer camcorder and if you have one, a professional dv cam. Consider
investing in a night vision lens for the pro dv.
If you haven’t done a lot of shooting, keep it simple. Avoid a lot of camera moves, cover
your subject, shoot tight and always get an establishing shot.
Be intrepid, but do not do anything that could possibly expose the sting. Do not shoot broll of meeting places during the sting, do not shoot suspect residences without talking to
police first, etc.
If your cameras or microphones are placed in a sting setting, ask the cops to record their
own set of tapes so you are not physically handing over tape without a subpoena.
Interview undercover cops (instead of their bosses). Even if you have to disguise their
identities, they are the much better for building tension and staying in reality.
Make sure you and your boss discuss and understand the pitfalls:
o You may not have control of your equipment at all times
o You may not have access to the complete story (like what happened on arrests
you didn’t witness, what the cops told suspects about your participation, etc.)
o You may be subpoenaed. (This was not a big concern in Datline’s Houston
Police story because the video was the witness). Every suspect pleaded out or
was convicted based on the video tape.
o The cases – or some of them – may be held up in court longer then you want to
wait. Look at history of case dispositions in similar stings to determine time
frame.
Triple check your understanding of whose identity should be masked (cops, informants).
Quadruple check images to make sure the masking is complete. Be sure to mask
identifiers other than faces like tattoos, distinct voices. Do not use mosaic because you
can see through it by squinting.
Shoot undercover cops so you don’t have to mask them later. Show them some sample
shots on the scene to be sure what they think is acceptable. Shoot tight shots of people
you know will have to be completely masked, like an informant or underage suspect.
