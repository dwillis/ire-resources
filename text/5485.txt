If you teach a data course or are thinking about starting one, join us for a conversation about
what works best when working with students. Bring examples of what you’ve tried that’s really
worked or what you’re planning to implement that you’re excited about. We hope everyone will
leave with new ideas and approaches.

Ideas
I am currently building a 60-minute exercise based on the same concept as “Escape Rooms” —
lock people in a room with data and tools and a challenge to come out with a story on a tight
deadline. It will be piloted this summer at London’s CIJ Summer Conference.
—Jonathan Stoneman
Focus on the CONCEPT not the tool; how to find answers, steps we need to take
Make screencasts for teaching tools, code.
Require outside work and then discuss problems students ran into.
Use Jupyter Notebook for class assignments and more.
R Studio - with Tidyverse
Instead of SQL - Access - SQLite, etc.

Javascript — most newsroom jobs are looking for it.

For an introductory data exercise, that could be used in basic freshman reporting classes, use
the FBI Uniform Crime Report data for your state. Have a good discussion about the source of
the data and its flaws. Describe data dictionaries. Download the data, have them calculate per

capita murder and crime rates, sort to find the most violent places. And for part two, map on
Google Fusion tables.

Teaching concepts/tools in blocks, each one centered on a distinct project or goal.

Questions
JavaScript only? (teach one programming language, not more)
How many include significant data in another required class? Social science methods?
Is data journalism training something your students can graduate without having had?
Inclusion strategies for lecture rooms and computer labs? —Meghan Kelly
