Infrastructure CAR

Investigating the state of America’s infrastructure can provide reporters with a prime opportunity to help
shed light on potential hazards in their communities. In addition, a wealth of data is available to help
reporters quantify and better understand the complicated issues plaguing America’s infrastructure.

Data
National Inventory of Dams*
http://www.nicar.org/data/dams/
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' National Inventory of Dams database, from 1993-2002, with information
on dam inspection, ownership and age. The agency often classifies dams as "high hazard," meaning that if
a dam fails, people are threatened downstream because of residential or commercial development. It also
indicates whether the dam owner has an emergency action plan, in case disaster does occur.

National Bridge Inventory*
http://www.nicar.org/data/bridges/
This dataset includes structural evaluations and information for bridges throughout the United States. The
inspection reports include important criteria necessary for evaluating the condition of bridges as well as
specific details relating to the location, age and ownership or each bridge. Latitude and longitude values are
also included. Many reporters have used this data to alert their communities to possible infrastructure
hazards.

Federal Procurement Data System*
http://www.ire.org/datalibrary/databases/fedcontacts/
Within this data are records of contracts the federal government has made with businesses relating to
infrastructure work, including construction of bridges, tunnels, highways, streets, water lines, sewer lines
and pipelines. Federal agencies are required to report contracts worth more than $25,000.

Consolidated Federal Funds Reports*
http://www.nicar.org/data/cffr/
This database includes records of federal money obligated to states, local governments, grants and direct
loans, including infrastructure-related programs. Some of these programs involve security and safety of
dams, highway planning and construction as well as the relocation of power lines, gas lines, roads, utilities
and bridges.

Federal Assistance Award Data System*
http://www.ire.org/datalibrary/databases/faads/
This database includes records of federal assistance relating to the nation's infrastructure awarded to
individuals, state and local governments, profit agencies as well as nonprofit organizations. About 600
federal assistance programs are covered in this data including programs relating to emergency flood
response and prevention; highway planning and construction; bridge alteration; road maintenance and

protection of essential highways, highway bridge approaches, etc. The Catalog of Federal Domestic
Assistance lists all of these programs. To search the programs go to www.cfda.gov.

Federal Highway Administration highway statistics
http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policy/ohpi/hss/hsspubs.htm
Collected nationwide by each state, data from 1992-2006 includes information from three main areas:
finance, use and physical performance/characteristics. Section V includes statistics on roadway extent,
characteristics and performance. Greg Reeves of The Kansas City Star used tables HM-63, “Present
Serviceability Ratings-pavements, by functional system” and HM-64, “Measured pavement roughness, by
functional system” for The Star’s 2003 “State of Disrepair” series. For more information on how Reeves and
reporter Judy Thomas used this data and more to measure pavement roughness see tipsheet #2050 from
the IRE Resource Center:

Vehicle Miles Traveled Database (VMT)
http://www.transtats.bts.gov/Tables.asp?DB_ID=155&DB_Name=Vehicle%20Miles%20Traveled%20%28V
MT%29&DB_Short_Name=VMT
Vehicle Miles Traveled data is reported as part of the Highway Statistics series and Traffic Volume Trends
produced by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). Annual VMT estimates are based on travel
reported by the various States to the Federal Highway Administration's Highway Performance Monitoring
System (HPMS). The Traffic Volume Trends program makes monthly estimates of the change in the
Nation's highway travel using data from continuous counters operated by the States.

Highway Safety Information System (HSIS)
http://www.hsisinfo.org
The Highway Safety Information System is a multistate database that contains crash, roadway inventory,
and traffic volume data for a select group of States. The HSIS is operated by the University of North
Carolina Highway Safety Research Center (HSRC) and LENDIS Corporation, under contract with FHWA.
The states covered include: California, Washington, Utah, Minnesota, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, Maine and
North Carolina.

State data
Be sure to check with your state department of transportation for the data they have available. A wealth of
information can be found here since most of this data is collected at the state level. This data tends to be
more current than the federal data and may include additional fields. Also, make sure you track down
relevant financial data (budgets, grants, etc.)
