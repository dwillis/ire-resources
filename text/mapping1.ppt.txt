Get familiar with basic mapping concepts

information

Examples of mapping stories

Mapping programs are grounded in the
databases and spreadsheets you've used.
A basic map table looks much like a
spreadsheet
But it adds geographical information to help
you see patterns
Polygons: outlined areas such as states,
counties, Census tracts
●Lines: highways, rivers, railroads
●Points: cities, events, crimes, UFO sightings
●

Let's begin
Start a new project

●

●

Create a new, blank map
Click on the ADD DATA button
Navigate to your folder and choose a
shapefile
Use the Identify button
to snoop
around.

Look at the whole table
Right click on the layer in the left rail
Choose “Attribute table”
It looks like a spreadsheet, right?

This is your data!

What can we do with this?
We can tweak the “symbology” by styling the
color of polygons based on a value of one of the
columns in our data.

Double-click on the layer
Choose the symbology tab
Look at categories and quantiles
Thems the breaks.

Normalize the data
This is just a fancy way of saying "compare this subset of
the data to the universe as a whole to put it in perspective."

Would it make sense to map the raw count
of Hispanic residents without comparing
them to the total population?
Use the "normalization" dropdown menu on the
symbology tab to choose the base number you want to use
for comparison. Then click "Apply."

Now you try
Map St. Louis' 65+ population
●Map the median age
●Map the diversity index
●

Where to find maps?
●

●

Your state GIS center
In New Jersey, it's run by the DEP
www.state.nj.us/dep/gis/
Census TIGER line Shapefiles released
each year with latest Census geographies
and more
