WHAT TO DO WHEN THEY SAY NO
In New York, police disciplinary records are not public. To write about
police misconduct, we turned to other records:
LAWSUITS
Lawsuits are always a good starting point because the plaintiffs and their
lawyers want to talk and press their case. In addition, lawyers are often able to
subpoena records not available under the Freedom of Information Law. Current
court cases are readily available online.

• Request depositions from the attorneys to get good quotes
• Read the complaint and all exhibits
POLICE INCIDENT REPORTS
Police departments generate reports on every criminal incident.
• Request the entire police report, including the narrative, to get the
fullest possible picture. Often, departments will only release a one-page
summary. More is available if you ask for it.
• The paper records can become graphic material for the story or put ·
online. Readers love them.
POLICE TELETYPES
Although police departments say police discipline is not public, they
routinely post teletypes - incidents of individual police discipline ;,., in the
precincts. Ask for those teletypes.
POLICE HANDBOOKS
Every department has a handbook of rules and regulations. They are very
specific and can provide guidance in understanding. how a department works .
