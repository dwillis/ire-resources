Remember, it’s just like any other beat.
You don’t have to be an expert, just find
ways to get up to speed by doing easy
stories, and then developing a plan for
longer-term coverage.

Our Armed Forces are dominating the
headlines.
 Russell Williams, the former commander of an
Airforce base near Ottawa is charged with two
murders, two sexual assaults and at least 82 socalled panty raids. He was recently on a suicide
watch. His wife was quoted in a court
document saying that she was shocked.
 This affair prompted us to turn over every rock
about his life and whether there was any
inkling of this kind of behaviour at work.

Afghanistan is a huge story in both countries.
MPs on the committee studying the mission,
recently returned from a special visit vowing to
support a move to keep some troops in that
country beyond our 2011 pull-out date.
 Our casualties continue to mount.
 Support for the war is diminishing.
 That committee of MPs is fighting to obtain
internal documents from the government.
 A special commission (MCC) is also
investigating.

What gets covered is the deaths in war.
 But this only skims the surface.
 The military is more than a fighting machine. It
is an institution made up of many parts:
soldiers, marines, airforce.
 The military is not only a major employer, but
a major spender and an economic engine.
 Buy American and Buy Canadian policies
embody the sometimes competing values of
regional development and good business.


So break it down just like you would any
institution and figure out a short and long-term
plan.
 In the short term, find easy stories based on
public documents such as annual reports.
 The Judge Advocate General responsible for
maintaining law and order in the armed forces.
 The JAG produces an annual report that is full
of great material that can lead to stories.

The general in charge of the troops in
Afghanistan was sent home for breaching the
policy on “Personal Relationships and
Fraternization. “
 And this was after he was hauled on the carpet
for the “accidental discharge” of his weapon.

For instance, the report tracks what are called
summary offences; that is, minor offences.
 Courts martial that are punishable with fines,
jail or both.
 Minor offences such as drunkenness.
 Serious offences include sexual assault and
possession of child pornography, trafficking.

There are other entry points.
 The military buys lots of equipment: planes;
ships, etc.
 How well are those procurement policies
working?
 This may fit into a longer-term strategy.
 For instance, in an age of free trade and
globalism, we still have lots of protectionism in
the military procurement area. Should we be
asking questions?

First just asked for briefing notes for the industry
minister, the one responsible for ship building.
There was a brief mention of escalated costs due to a
buy Canada Policy.
Billions of dollars are at stake, so follow the money.
Are there contractors in your market?
To what degree is your market dependent on the
military?
I submitted a follow-up request to obtain more info.
Filled with vague language, but intriguing references,
as we saw
Essentially, the risk is the excess cost to taxpayers.

Who else does business with the military?
 For instance, what firms handling their
moving?
 Is the process for selecting those firms fair?
 Who handles the IT for the military?
 Again, is the process used to choose the
contractor fair?
 What records does the military routinely
produce for public and private consumption?


What illnesses are afflicting people?
 National Public Radio just did stories on the
effects of concussions, something that I will
follow up in Canada.
 Find people who study the military.
 But be careful for conflicts of interest, as some
of these spokesmen are nothing but shills
masquerading as legitimate experts.
 Check out the universities and colleges.

TIP SHEET
Ask lots of questions to find out what records
the military keeps.
 What statistics do they collect, and when do
they have to be reported up the line?
 Ask for general or summary stats that can
reveal trends, but conceal identities.
 Once trends are identified, drill down.
 Example on the next slide

Go online and take an inventory of records the
military keeps.
 Inventory of databases that can be obtained,
preferably in database format.
 Learn some CAR skills to slice and dice the
numbers in ways the military doesn’t in its
summary reports.
 Obtain an archive of the report in question that
may contain stats. The farther back the better.
