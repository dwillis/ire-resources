Finding information online
Be sure to verify that it comes from an official source
such as a .gov site. Be sure to cite your sources of
information.
 You may be getting only summaries of the
information, not the information itself.




Day-care center and nursing home inspections summarize
findings online. Paper records have the detail. Same with
OSCN in many counties.

If you have the time, it’s always best to pull the
actual paper records.
 Give people a chance to comment on what you’ve
found.
