1. Bookmark a find data or handful of Web sites that you know you can use to find
data or techniques or answers to questions on deadline. Become familiar with the
NICAR ‘Net Tour.
2. Carve out a neglected niche in you newsroom that is CAR intensive. For example,
if have no one dedicated full-time to the census releases, master them and pitch
them at reporters whose beats overlap the data. Know
http://www.2000census.org/
3. Broaden your definition of CAR. It’s more than sorting in Excel and grouping in
Access. Do the hands-on training exercises in the NICAR Tutorials. Attend an
advanced NICAR bootcamp. Read Phil Meyer’s Precision Journalism.
4. Steal good ideas. Look at Extra, Extra, especially the CAR category, linked from
the IRE home page. Also, there are more than 400 CAR projects in the IRE
Resource Center.
5. Get to be the numbers person in your newsroom. Sometimes, a single number
makes the story work and garners unbelievable praise from editors. Study
Numbers in the Newsroom: Using Math and Statistics in News by Sarah Cohen in
the IRE Beat Book Series.
6. Network with CAR folks here and go to NICAR conferences every year.
Subscribe to the NICAR-L listserv.
7. Champion the release of data electronically, not just on paper. Keep abreast of the
latest in the FOI Center.
8. Be aware of the breadth of data available and build a collection of databases to
use on deadline. Check the essential databases in the NICAR Database Library.
Make data purchases part of your annual budget.
9. Resist Stockholm Syndrome of your newsroom. Be a voice of change.
10. Have fun.
