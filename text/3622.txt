Battling data price tag
inflation
MaryJo Webster and Ryan McNeill

Know your law...
--- Knowing your laws is the first step. It allows
you to counter claims with authority and call
shenanigans early.
--- In Texas, the AG produces a handy update
to the TPIA each year, complete with
references to rulings, etc. Your state is likely
similar.

Ask for itemized breakdowns...
--- Make them be as specific as possible.
--- Does your law allow for such charges?
--- Red flags: CPU time, overhead costs (for
example, the cost of employee benefits),
verifying accuracy, search fees, redactions and
and anything not explained.

If allowed to charge hourly rates...
--- Make sure they are charging you the correct
rate.
--- For example, Minnesota law only allows
bodies to charge the hourly rate of the lowestpaid person who is capable of doing the work.
--- In Oklahoma, search fees are banned when
not commercial. Bodies only allowed to charge
for direct cost of reproduction.

Geek to geek...
--- Ask to speak directly with IT people handling
your query.
--- If it's truly a matter of no know-how, offer to
help write the SQL.
--- Even if it's not, offering to write the SQL
shows you're prepared and ready to call
shenanigans.
--- If you can, demand a copy of whatever
scripts they write to extract the data...You paid
for it.

Be as clear as possible...
--- You want a data dump. You don't need a
pretty report that they provide to their bosses.
--- Sometimes prices inflate because staff want
to join relational tables to create flat files. You
know how to do joins.

Know how the data exists.
--- Ask for record layouts, schemas, code
books and whatever information might help you
understand how the data are stored.
--- Sometimes worthwhile to do this before
requesting actual data.
--- If you know the complexity of the data, you'll
know whether they are blowing smoke with
programming costs.

Size doesn't matter...
--- As a general rule, itâ€™s no more work to
produce 50 records vs. 1 million records. The
only thing that changes is the storage media.

If you know they're violating the
law...
--- Try asking your company's lawyer to write a
strongly-worded letter to the agency.
--- No lawyer? Write your own. Cite the law.
Show them you know what you're talking about.
--- Don't be afraid to file complaints with the
district attorney, attorney general or anyone
else who will listen.
--- ...but don't be surprised when prosecutors
do absolutely nothing.
