Why does college cost so much
and where does the money go?

College costs have soared – even adjusting for inflation

SOURCE: The College Board, Trends in College Pricing 2012, Figure 5.

Tuition isn’t the only thing climbing

The climbing wall has become code for the amenities arms race on campuses
across the country. Colleges say students and parents are demanding this stuff.
But at what price to their education? (Marketplace/NPR)

Million-dollar presidents (bow ties not included)

E. Gordon Gee makes millions as president of Ohio State University, but a
Dayton Daily News investigation found the university spends almost as
much for Gee to travel the globe, throw parties, wine and dine donors,
woo prospective faculty, hang out with students and staff and maintain a
9,600-square-foot mansion on 1.3 acres.

Not that everyone cares

Senior strategic communications major Aly Pollard said she was surprised by
Boschini's total compensation. Pollard said she thought the chancellor's salary
would be higher because of the high caliber of students, campus appearance,
tuition amount and the high economic status in which most students at the
university live. (The Daily Skiff)

And if you think that’s a lot…

You may have heard that the highest-paid employee in each state is usually the
football coach at the largest state school.
This is actually a gross mischaracterization: Sometimes it is the basketball coach.
(Deadspin)

States have cut back on higher ed spending

Nearly half of the cost of public higher education is now borne
by students in the form of tuition, more than double the
proportion of 25 years ago. (The Hechinger Report)
