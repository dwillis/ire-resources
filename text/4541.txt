“Just be sure, if you fail, you did
what you wanted to do.”
-- David Letterman
to Jerry Seinfeld,
1988

If you're lucky enough to sit in the
closest seat to the action at this
afternoon's opener at Fenway Park,
when Pedro Martinez throws the
first pitch to Baltimore's Jerry
Hairston, you're sitting 53 feet 11
inches from the plate.

That is, you're a couple of steps
closer to the batter than Martinez
is.

No net obscures your view, because
most of the new seats on the field
are not behind the backstop. And
no net protects you if Hairston
swings late on a Martinez fastball
and fouls one in your direction.

With the ball coming at you at
about 100 miles per hour, you
have barely one-third of a second
to duck -- if you don't take time to
put down your hot dog and
cellphone.

"She was lucky she didn't get
caught flush. It would have killed
her," said Paula Chepes of Lynn,
who was sitting two seats away.
"We were watching. We saw it
coming. We all ducked at the last
second, but there's no way she
could get out of the way. It was
milliseconds. Milliseconds."

These seats are 90 feet from
home, in the last row before the
walkway that separates the lower
seats from the grandstand.
So, Paula, would you like to
switch seats? That gentleman just
across the aisle is also 90 feet from
home plate, but he's protected by
the net.

"No! I don't want to sit behind
the net!"
And if you had the $250, how
would you like to sit down in thr
front row -- 53 feet 11 inches from
home plate?
"Oooh! How do you get one of
those?"

In an interview with Newsday,
Schlesinger [the lawyer] said
Whelan [the judge] appointed him
because the plaintiff had requested
him.

When told the court file indicated
the plaintiff had asked for Hoffman
[another lawyer], Schlesinger said
Hoffman was not on the state’s
approved receiver list.

2. Rebut the rebuttals
When told that Hoffman is on the
approved list, Schlesinger said
Hoffman was not licensed to
practice law in New York.

When told that Hoffman is licensed
in New York, Schlesinger said he did
not know why Whelan named him
receiver.
