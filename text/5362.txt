THE ONLY ONE IN THE NEWSROOM | ​NICAR 2018

First steps
-

Figure out what need you’re trying to fill. Are you trying to create an investigative
team or just be able to take a couple days off without getting a call from work?
Set reasonable goals.
Talk with potential stakeholders, find out their expectations and concerns.
Have a learning path and related materials ready on day 1.
Find allies in the newsroom, whether reporters or editors.
Stay accountable to your personal goals. Sometimes a friend in the newsroom
can be better at this than a manager, set a regular time to check in.
Celebrate wins small and large.
Ask for help.

alone. Many of us have been in position of trying something new and not knowing where to turn
for guidance. Here’s some links:
- Look for local groups of national organizations, like IRE and SPJ and find out if they
have regular meet ups. If not, start one.
