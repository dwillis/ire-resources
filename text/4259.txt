Bulletproofing isn’t just fact-checking. It’s assumption-checking, data-checking, sourcechecking, and bias-checking. And it starts the moment you begin work on the story.

Have a plan. Take the time to list the specific things you’ll need to prove to establish your
premise. How will you prove them?
Know where you got your documents and data. If your story is based on documents,
think about who gave them to you. Was it the person or organization that created them? If
not, where did your source get them, and how can you verify their authenticity? If your
story is based on data, take the time to understand how the data were compiled
If you’re using a database, check it aggressively. Data can be bad for lots of reasons.
Sometimes, the records are wrong or incomplete. Other times, the actual methods for
collecting the data produce inaccuracies. If the data are wrong, so is your story.
If the database comes from a government agency, talk to the agency "geeks"—the people
who update the database on a regular basis. Data experts in the open records office are
particularly helpful, because they work with the data all the time and compile reports for
journalists who request the data. Ask them to explain what the fields mean.
Find outside experts who can help you understand your subject, and find them early.
Someone somewhere studies the subject you’re writing about. Ask them basic questions
and never be afraid of looking stupid. Get their input on your reporting plan. Academics
have developed standard methodologies to study all kinds of things. You don’t need to
reinvent them. You’ll end up with a better analysis, and a measure of credibility you
could never achieve on your own.
Build in extra time to check your work. You can’t rush this.

Keep track of your work. Keep notes whenever you try to contact someone. Keep notes
about the documents you’re looking at.

Also keep track of how you’re analyzing your data. Keep a log of any changes or
corrections you’re making. Also keep a diary of how you’re conducting the analysis and
why you’re doing it that way. You’ll forget if you don’t.
Be knowledgeable about your sources. Run background checks. Understand their biases
and their motives for talking to you.
Verify your data with actual, on-the-ground reporting. Does your data describe a place?
Go there. Does it describe a person? Talk to them.
Put your documents in one place, preferably one where you can search them. Label and
annotate them so you can find key excerpts when you need them.
Keep an outline of your findings as you go. It will change a lot. For everything you put in
it, explain how you know it.
For long, complicated stories, keep a timeline to track major events and the people
involved.
Remember that the reporting process isn’t private. Your e-mails, texts, voicemails can
come back to haunt you. Some of the people you’re investigating will look for anything
to use against you. Don’t give them anything. Be professional.

Never surprise the people in your story. Before you publish, tell them what it will say
about them. If they’re the subject, tell them your conclusions. People can love your story
or hate it, but they should never be surprised by it.
Give your subject an adequate opportunity to respond. If you’ve been working on
something for months, asking for a response within hours is unreasonable.
If you’re working on a story based on data or documents, consider sharing them with the
subject before publication. At a minimum, give them an opportunity to review your
methodology.
Check every fact in your story – every name, every number. Check job titles—make sure
you're not referring to someone by a previous job title, or a future one, if you're writing
about something that happened in the past.
Check every characterization in your story. Is there another way someone could
characterize the same facts? If so, why is yours the right one?
Check the landmines you might miss: teasers, promo copy, subheads, cutlines, photo
credits, map labels, etc.
Watch your language. Some words – “failed,” “conspired” – are inherently loaded. Use
them sparingly, and only when you know you’re right. Also watch out for superlatives
(“biggest”, “most expensive”); can you back that up?
Have your lawyer read the story. They’re likely to have lots of questions about how you
know what you claim to know, and they can apprise you of the risks. If you’re lucky
enough to have a really good lawyer, you’ll also get something like an extra edit.
Undermine your story. What do you know that undercuts your premise? That discredits
your sources? If you were attacking your story, how would you do it?

Check your units. Don't confuse parts per million and parts per billion. Verify all
conversions—Celsius/Fahrenheit, miles/kilometers, milligrams/micrograms, etc. Make
sure your verbal descriptions are correct. If an agency changes the acceptable risk level
for excess cases of cancer from one in a million to one in 100,000, is the standard getting
more conservative (stringent) or less?
Scientists often have specialized knowledge that's not apparent from their job title or
degree. Someone could be a professor in an ecology department but know very little
about ecology—they might be an oceanographer by training, or a geochemist. It may be
better to refer to them by their area of expertise, rather than their official department title.
Some science stories are about uncertainty. You can still bulletproof these stories, as long
as you can explain why the uncertainty exists—is it a lack of data? a lack of research
funds? In many cases, the uncertainty becomes the story.
Scientific language matters. If you're paraphrasing a scientist's quote, or replacing a term
with a synonym, make sure your word choice is accurate.
On the other hand, sometimes it's better to avoid a scientific term that's easily
misinterpreted:

When you publish
• Post as much of your supporting evidence as you can. Share your documents (on
DocumentCloud or elsewhere). If you can post your data, do that too. Consider using
links or footnotes to take readers directly to your supporting evidence. (But beware:
Before you post documents, make sure you’ve read them. Sometimes even innocuous
documents can have a stray Social Security number or something else you might not
publish if you knew it was there.)
• Listen if people complain. Take their criticism seriously. Respond promptly and never
defensively. If something is wrong, acknowledge it and correct it right away.
