We tracked federal data integrity in 2017.
Now it's our Web Integrity Project.

Congress drafted the Honest Ads Act with us

The Speaker of
the House put
our OPEN
Government Data
Act into a new
evidence-based
public policy bill.

We're pushing to connect freedom of
information demand to open data
disclosures in every city, state and
nation.

"Most corrupt
in history" is not
hyperbole.

What are we doing about it?

Tracking President Trump's conflicts of interest

We started in November 2016, with a document…

…that grew, and grew, and grew, and grew…

…so we turned it into structured data…

…which led to new funding for the project…

…which is driving reporting and development.

Here's how we did it.

What's next?
