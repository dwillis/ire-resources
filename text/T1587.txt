What’s coming from Census 2000 in the coming year is formally known as SF3 – Summary File 3. Journalists call
it “the good stuff” -- data on education, income, poverty, migration, commuting, ancestry, disability, occupation,
industry and more.
The data will come in two waves:
-- Profiles, executive summaries of a sort. Four pages per state/county/city. Draft format at
http://cronkite.pp.asu.edu/census/draft_sf3profile.xls. Coming state by state, tentatively April to June.
-- Data, the full 812 tables. Draft list at http://cronkite.pp.asu.edu/census/sf3docs.zip Details for states, cities and
counties down to neighborhood (census tract) or small neighborhood (block group). Format not complete, but count on
dozens of files for each state. To accommodate PC software, the thousands of columns of data will be slit across
dozens of files – imagine a very wide page torn into lots of vertical strips. Line up help or plan to download hundreds
of megabytes and link and extract just what you want. Coming state by state, tentatively June through August.
Last year’s Census stories were obvious: growth and change. Racial trends. Age trends. This year’s data is
appealing on its face, but more challenging to mine for good stories because:
-- Another year has gone by. An eventful year. Editors’ skepticism is higher.
-- Stories aren’t so obvious. If you rank your state’s counties by household income, what do you say about that list?
-- Data volume is bigger. So are data issues. Last year’s data came from every household, while SF3 comes from
just 1 in 6 households, on average. So there are error margins to think about. And data collection and editing issues:
What counts as income? How many unanswered questions had to be filled in – imputed – by Census-devised rules?
And what is a “go-outside-home disability”?
Last year you could plan to write deadline stories about the data as it was presented by the Census Bureau. That
may work a little this year, but it’s more likely you’ll be working backward from topics of local concern to see what
the data says about them. More than ever, you’ll have to plan ahead.
Last year we dealt with trends that were pervasive or simple to map, like people moving to the exurbs or minorities
moving from city to suburbs. But this year we have to deal with multi-directional or multi-centered things like
commuting trends or linguistic.
This year, the think tanks, interest groups and professorate swing into full gear analyzing Census 2000 data. Count
on lots of studies. Ask around at local institutions for an early heads-ups so you’re not trying on deadline to understand
methodology studded with ∑ and Φand Ψ. And watch for the agendas! Read up on a field first.

Segregation
John Logan, a sociologist at SUNY Albany, has taken a page from journalists’ notebooks in doing deadline Census
data analysis. See his archive of reports and data: http://www.albany.edu/mumford/census. The Brookings Institution
has commissioned and published several looks at this: http://www.brookings.org/es/urban/issues/housing/housing.htm.
A good book-length grounding in this subject is “American Apartheid,” (Harvard University Press 1994), by Douglas
Massey and Nancy Denton.

Sprawl
The USA TODAY Sprawl Index ranks every metro on a density-based scale. It used 1990 and 1999 population data
and showed that natural forces, like availability of water, shape sprawl as much as government: sprawl.usatoday.com.
Also see SprawlWatch Clearinghouse, http://www.sprawlwatch.org/ and http://www.sierraclub.org/sprawl/. For case
studies and collections of headlines, see the Urban Land Institute’s Smart Growth section at
http://research.uli.org/DK/SpPer/re_SpPer_SmrtGrthNws_fst.html. For libertarian perspectives, see the Cato Institute’s
papers at http://www.cato.org/research/natur-st.html#8 and abundant work from the Reason Public Policy Institute at
http://www.rppi.org/.
Income inequality
There’s quite a literature among labor economists. Growth in this trend stopped in the mid-1990s after rising
steadily for 30 years, but it remains far higher than other industrialized nations. Does this matter? Start with the Census
Bureau’s neutral take at http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income.html#inequality, especially
http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/p60204.html. A 1998 speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is
worth reading: http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/1998/19980828.htm. He spoke at the opening of a
symposium of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City on the subject, and proceedings are at
http://www.kc.frb.org/PUBLICAT/SYMPOS/1998/sym98prg.htm. There’s also a Federal Reserve Board of New York
conference volume, http://www.newyorkfed.org/rmaghome/econ_pol/1999.htm. A couple articles in the Bureau of
labor Statistics monthly review help, too: http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/1997/12/art1abs.htm and
http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/1995/08/art5abs.htm and http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/1995/09/art1abs.htm. For a good
synopsis of the viewpoint that it doesn’t matter as long as people can move up – and down – the ladder, see the 1995
annual report of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas for its featured study, “By Our Own Bootstraps,”
http://www.dallasfed.org/htm/pubs/pdfs/anreport/arpt95.pdf.
Redistricting
Mark Monmonier’s book title, “Bushmanders and Bullwinkles: How Politicians Manipulate Electronic Maps and
Census Data to Win Elections” (University of Chicago Press 2001) is long but apt. The book itself is short, a good
primer, well-illustrated and fairly clear. The Center for Voting and Democracy has a viewpoint but also lots of basic
reports and maps at http://www.fairvote.org/redistricting/. So does the National Conference of State Legislatures at
http://www.ncsl.org/programs/legman/elect/redist.htm. For partisan takes, see http://www.rnc.org/redistricting and
http://www.ncec.org/redistricting/. For a weekly update, watch House Race Extra, a Web column co-written by my copanelist, Maureen Hurley Schweers of Hotline. The current edition and link to archive rest at
