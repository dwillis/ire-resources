SOME INTEL
• No, you cannot FOIA a non-profit.

• Nonprofits are required to give you their latest 990 …
which still may be very out of date.
• There’s no official “shady stuff we do” box. 990s are
imperfect.

THE GREATEST THING I’VE EVER
FOUND ON A 990: SCHEDULE 0

AND THEN …

NOW ABOUT SCHEDULE B …
• Not available for Form 990
• Only available for form 990-PF

• Private foundations:
– Get most of their revenue from a single source/family
– Example: the Gates Foundation
– Have to disclose more

– Are subject to stricter rules

EXAMPLE: SCHEDULE B

REVERSE ENGINEERING MAGIC

990 DATA: A
STORY

NEW DATA

ALWAYS ASK: WHAT’S MISSING
• Organizations that file by paper
• Tiny groups that file a 990-N

• Nonprofits that don’t file at all
• Forms that haven’t been processed yet
• Forms processed before 2011

FORMAT: XML

KEY DATA IN TAGS

SCHEDULE B: NONCASH

HOW I DID IT:
• Use the XML files to find all large non-cash gifts
• Manually write down the ticker symbols

• Use a database of stock prices to get the prices of the stock on the day of the gift, and the days
after
• Use R to join
• For each gift, calculate the price 20 or 30 days after
• Look for outliers
• Monte Carlo?! Cumulative abnormal returns?!

A REALLY, REALLY GOOD TIME TO
DONATE STOCK
