The Longest Yard
Stories you can (or should) do
Campaign contributions
In your town, team tycoons, players and coaches are politically active. So are agents, leagues, unions and
college boosters. So, to whom do they donate? What candidate, party or shadowy 527 group got their money
going into the election, and what does that say about the people, league or union putting
up the dollars? Check out local, state and national election campaign disclosure forms. Keep a database from
year to year to track spending. Learn more at http://www.campaignfinance.org/
Nonprofit scandals
Former and current athletes, coaches, owners and boosters like to form nonprofit groups. Some pros want to
give back to the community. Some parents want to support the local high school football powerhouse. So,
follow the money. Pull the 501(C ) filings in your town to see how much they raise and from whom. How
much lobbying do they do? Who is on the payroll, Joe Jock’s cousin? How much is he paid from
contributions? Are the football boosters violating Title IX mandates with their support of the team? What
sort of gifts did the boosters give to the coaches? Did they buy him a car? What are your state’s ethics
guidelines on that? By the way, even sports leagues, such as the NFL, file public tax exemption documents
annually. I’ve attached a few from the NFL, a multi-million dollar league that functions, according to its IRS
501 ( C)(6) exemptions, like a chamber of commerce.
FOIA documents from IRS or visit http://www.guidestar.org/
Arena land grabs
State U wants to build a new arena. So do the professional Mighty Pancakes from Capital City. Who’s going
to pay for it and how are they going to get the land? Is eminent domain going to be used? What was the
estimated price for the property before the Mighty Pancakes got involved and was there governmental muscle
to acquire the land? Public data easily available includes property tax assessments, TIF agreements, bond
issuances, traffic studies, economic impact surveys and other documents that will help you explain the
consequences of the proposed stadium. In many cities, much of this is online. Were state grants involved?
Track the reporting requirements for those. In a similar vein, take a look at Mark Gillispie’s stuff in the
Cleveland Plain Dealer.

Injuries
OK, if NICAR lets me be the guru on football injuries, I’ll cede gymnastics to the Orange County Register.
But did you know the most dangerous sport when it comes to concussions is thoroughbred horse racing? Or
that mandatory head trauma testing in the U.S. lags far behind the U.K. and Australia? How about studies
focusing on the freakish ability for morbidly obese college athletes to run, jump and throw? Or that
cheerleaders are the only participants who risk injury more in practice than games? Or that the most
dangerous formation on any football field might be the cheerleaders’ two-level pyramid? All of this can be
found in medical studies that haven’t gotten much press. You can use them as a jumping-off point for unique
research of your own. Check out the British Medical Journal (bjsm.bmjjournals.com), National Library of
Medicine (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=journals) and Medline (medline.cos.com/) to
trawl for ideas. Often, research notes that appear in journals reveal physicians and scientists picking up on

trends before most beat reporters (such as dehydration injuries, the dangers of certain nutritional supplements,
performance enhancing drug scofflaws and innovative surgeries that can prolong players’ careers).

Discrimination
Discriminating against women in any educational program, even sports, is illegal. These are stories that draw
in typically male sports fans AND women readers. Chart how the high schools and colleges in your area
recruit, train, fete and fund local athletes. Explore the controversies about the law, including why some
colleges and universities slash men’s programs. Use other documents from state and federal databases to
track athletes by race or class.
Caveat: Check out the November-December 2002 issue of IRE Journal for pitfalls.
Sidebar: It’s never a bad idea to stop by the courthouse and take a peek at civil and criminal court filings.
Dead beat parents infect all parts of society, even the ranks of professional athletes, coaches and club owners.
When you add it all up, you might get a compelling series like Sports Illustrated’s much-discussed “Where’s
Daddy?” issue, April 28, 1998.

Money
How much money does your team really make? Analyze ticket sales, apparel deals and other revenue streams
to see how State U or the Mighty Pancakes prosper, or misspend or whatever. An understanding of the
unique economics to each sport will help you explain to your sports editor why the story about raising ticket
prices to compensate for a rise in player salaries is hooey. Search Edgar, TIF agreements, etc., to chart the
real economic impact of a local team. Find out about the shoe contract State U’s coach has signed with
SneakerCo. And, by the way, where do those sneakers come from? A Thai sweatshop? What are the
university’s policies on that? How does the revamped SneakerCo Stadium, with all the new luxury boxes and
club seating, hurt Joe Sixpack’s chances to go to a game?
Check out Lisa Chedekel’s and Matthew Kaufman’s Hartford Courant piece (http://www.courant.com/hccontracts0219.artfeb19,0,5149658.story)

High school sports
This is where most newspaper sports sections spend the majority of their real estate, however it’s also the
place where you’ll be more likely to have to build your own database. But it might be worth it. Some things
you might want to look at: comparing athletic department budgets, tracking coaches’ salaries (especially in
the more predominant sports in your local schools), or looking at influences from booster clubs (check out an
older story by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution called “Pay Dirt!” on this topic).

Interested in trying some mapping? How about mapping where you local athletes are going to college? Or
where do the stars for the private powerhouse come from? The Dayton Daily News asked that very question,
and it took them around the world.

Utilizing in-house resources
A lot of newspapers publish their own “power” rankings of local football, basketball or baseball (or other
sports) programs at the high school level. If you don’t already do this, perhaps you can get the rankings
entered directly into a database so that you have an archive to find trends over time. At USA TODAY, we’ve
just recently put our high school Super 25 rankings and college Coaches Poll rankings into databases. In both
cases, the person typing up the weekly information does the work in an Access database and a complex set of
programs (written in Visual Basic for Applications) archives the material, generates the rankings and shoots
out a file to our publishing system, all ready for publication. We’ve also spent a lot of time and money retyping the older coaches polls in order to build a historical archive.
Both USA Today and the Pittsburgh Trib solicit NFL payroll information every year (we also tab adjustments
from the NFLPA), but only USA Today puts the information into handy online databases. We just list the
Steelers.
www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/salaries/default.aspx
On the court (or field)
The thing to keep in mind when you want to look at game statistics to find trends is that this is well-traveled
ground, especially in this day-and-age of the Internet. So you need to find a way to slice and dice or focus on
a particular area that is less common. For example, every year USA TODAY looks at which players perform
the best in the final two minutes of a game when the game is still on the line (score is within 5 points). In
other words, who performs in the clutch? To do this, we had to get play-by-play data and scores at the twominute mark for each game (which we got from Elias Sports Bureau).
At the Trib, one Excel database, “Seasons,” has tracked every rushing, receiving and passing stat compiled
over the past 60 years. We started with the foundation of Elias, but now make hay with unique analyses
about the longevity of rushers, tease out hidden gems in the receiving corps and give columnists the fodder to
blow hard about the league’s best QBs or tailbacks. As for players, I’ve cultivated sources by showing their
place in history, one digit at a time.

The Sociology of Sports Online edition. Wow. How does New Zealand deal with the specter of sailing’s
“brain drain” from her shores? How does racism influence the drafting of NFL players? Do football
athletes “self segregate” by position? What can “stacking” analysis teach us about race and culture in
sports? How about statistical analyses revealing the hidden world of the wives of professional male
athletes? What if you wanted to measure, historically, the growing power of college coaches and their push
for “homogenization, Taylorization, bureaucratization, and control?” Maybe an ethnographic study of the
junior golf circuit? Is there a rise in suicides or murders when the hometown champs leave for more
lucrative climes? Read the back issues!

Data Resources:

High school participation surveys: Your state high school association surveys its member schools every year and
that information is sent on to the National Federation of State High School Associations, http://www.nfhs.org/
Information is at summary level -- total number of girls statewide playing soccer, for example. This survey covers
about 90% of U.S. public and private high schools. Surveys go back to the 1970s. Links to all state high school
associations are at: http://www.nfhs.org/scriptcontent/Va_Custom/Directory/MemberDirectory.cfm
Some high school athletics associations are very good about sharing detailed data on all aspects of competition.
www.khsaa.org/
College Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act Data (EADA): Under Title IX, all colleges and universities receiving
federal funds must file this report. Since 2001, the reports have been filed electronically and are available in a
database. Contact the Office of Post Secondary Education to get a version in Excel or Access. A searchable version
of the database is located at: http://www.ope.ed.gov/athletics/
Data includes participation numbers, numbers and average salaries for coaches, revenues and expenditures for each
sport and how much is not allocated (administrative expenses). Search individual colleges at
ope.ed.gov/athletics/Search.asp.
Integrated Post-Secondary Education System Data (IPEDS): A monster database from the Dept of Education.
Entire database can be downloaded from the Web. For each school, you’ll find things such as enrollment by
race/ethnicity; revenue and expenditure by source of income and type of expense; salaries of FT instructional faculty
by academic rank and tenure status; completions by type of program, level of award, race/ethnicity and gender; and
many other details. Nothing specific to athletics, however this might be a supplement to something you do regarding
colleges. Data includes a flag to identify what athletic organization (NCAA, etc) the school belongs to.
http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/
Graduation Rates: You’ll have to build your own database, but all the information is just sitting out there on the
NCAA web site, http://www.ncaa.org/
The information is broken down by sport, race and gender and is available back to the late 1980s.
The Olympics : Scandalized by revelations Olympics organizers were bought and sold by sites seeking the games,
more financial information related to the international movement is shared with the public. IOC financial reports,
including auditors’ notes, are now online, including financial projections for upcoming games.
multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_678.pdf and
www.olympic.org/uk/organisation/facts/introduction/index_uk.asp. Consultants also weigh in.
www.gamesbids.com/english/index.shtml
Archival Research: Some of the best hard data is available at the research libraries of the various Halls of Fame.
At the Professional Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, a basement archive the size of a college library awaits
the very few reporters who venture down there every year. The key researcher and public relations coordinator is
the great Joe Horrigan (330) 456-8207. Key sources of data: Congressional studies on the safety and economics of
football, attendance tallies, depth charts, injury reports, camp rosters, medical research, game analyses, agent
directories and other sources unavailable elsewhere.
www.athleticdirectory.com/halloffamedir.html
Securities and Exchange Commission and other federal filings: Much of the business of sports is conducted by
publicly traded companies or business entities that are regulated by some federal or state agency. Comcast owns the
76ers and Flyers, and the arena they play in. The Yes!Network broadcasts Yankees games. Cablevision/MSM has
large stakes in the Nicks and Rangers. GlobalSports operates the internet sales for the Chargers. The USBL, unlike
the NBA, is a traded OTC company. In some sports, such as thoroughbred and auto racing, the top players are

publicly traded firms, including Churchill Downs, International Speedway (NASCAR) and several European soccer
giants. Nike and other biggies list endorsement deals on their 10-K filings. NewsCorp must discuss probable losses
related to broadcasting NFL and MLB. Say hello to Edgar at www.sec.gov/.

Recent CAR stories off sports desks
Jan 31, 2005
“Recruiting trail: it costs a lot to sell free rides”, by Mike Knobler, Atlanta JournalConstitution. Knobler used public record requests to investigate the recruiting
expenditures on top high school football prospects by Georgia and Georgia Tech. "Tech
budgeted $556,703 for 2004-05 football recruiting, which works out to more than
$25,000
for each of the 18-20 players expected to sign with the Yellow Jackets on
Wednesday. But that
per-player figure is misleading: In recruiting, like in fishing, you
spend much of your effort
on the ones that got away." The story details expenses ranging
from filet mignon dinners to
rental cars with GPS navigation systems so that coaches
don't get lost visiting recruits'
homes.

Jan. 23, 2005
“Wrong Side of the Track,” by Janet Patton, Lexington Herald-Leader.
An excellent report on the “dirty little secret” of Kentucky horse racing.
Patton found that only about a third of the trainers licensed in Kentucky reported carrying
workers’ comp insurance for laborers and uncovered workers were injured and had nowhere to
turn for help. Patton revealed the irony that million dollar horses are often cared for by some of
the state’s least-protected and poorest workers.

“Bowl Game Goodies Add Up for CO,” Todd Hartman and Kevin Vaughan,
Rocky Mountain News
The kind of story any newspaper near a large university can do, but few do as
well as Hartman and Vaughan. The reporters traced the money spent by the university for players,
coaches, administrators and donors, finding a trail of electronic gadgets, questionable gifts and
plush parties. The university couldn’t cover all costs with their bowl earnings, so they dipped into
other funds.
www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_3426993,00.html
NOTE: There’s been an explosion of hard-hitting stories about the costs of college football over
the past few months, with newspapers increasingly probing how much schools spend to woo high
school stars to their programs. Two of the best investigations came from the Indianapolis Star and
the Atlanta Journal Constitution.
Dec. 19, 2004

“Gymnasts in Pain: Out of Balance.,” Scott M. Reid, Orange County Register.
A great survey of a little studied sport, female gymnastics, the newspaper built the report
atop interviews from 300 women who competed on national teams from 1980-2004. The vast
majority of the competitors interviewed said they suffered broken bones
or injuries that required surgery and that they often trained and competed while suffering serious
ailments. No NFL linebacker suffers more than these kids.

SELF-SERVING NOTE: Check out the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review’s “Bloody Sundays”
package on NFL injuries. The Trib entered thousands of individual player injury reports from
weekly NFL disclosures into Excel, then combined other unique spreadsheets and regression
analysis to show the darker side of life in the league.

“Pro Team Owners Play Political Game,” Michael Hiestand, USA TODAY.
Very timely hit on spending by 153 professional sports magnates, their employees and families on
political campaigns. Included nifty breakdowns of the tycoons, the parties and organizations they

“Empty Backfield: Why Running Backs Are Overrated,” Aaron Schatz, Slate.
Part of a renaissance of sports columnists wielding strong CAR skills to make their points, Schatz
follows in the tradition of Allen Barra and Bill James by focusing on numbers, money and social
aspects of the game few reporters bother to study. Schatz also is a co-founder of the great online
forum Football Outsiders and an editor of Brassey’s Pro Football Forecast 2004. In this “Sports
Nut” piece, he makes a compelling argument for disregarding the impact of elite “feature backs”
and explains why the loss of star rusher Ricky Williams likely would have little effect on the
fortunes of the sagging Dolphins. www.slate.com/id/2106074
NOTE: Don’t forget the master, himself. Barra combined his studies of history, economics and
advanced stat research to explain why today’s running backs put up such gaudy numbers, but are
growing increasingly irrelevant to the modern game. “Season of the Running Backs” ran in Slate
on Dec. 30, 2003.
www.slate.com/id/2093319
WHAT ABOUT TENNIS? Check out the nifty article by Raymond Lee, “Numbers Reveal the
No. 1 Player of the Open Era,” Tennis Week, Sept. 17, 2003. Lee’s statistical analysis of
professional tennis champs since 1968 makes a compelling case for Bjorn Borg as the best player
during that span, infuriating Pete Sampras’ fans.
www.sportsmediainc.com/tennisweek/index.cfm?func=showarticle&newsid=9427
A worthy volley, however, came from David McCarthy’s story, “Sampras Reigns as Top Player
in Open Era,” Tennis Week, Sept. 28, 2004.

TRIPLE WORD SCORE: He probably wouldn’t acknowledge it, but the great Stefan Fatsis of the
Wall Street Journal perfects the unholy alliance of George Plimpton and Bernhard Riemann.
Check out the obsessive ethnography on the high-stakes world of competitive Scrabble in Word
Freak: Heartbreak, Triumph, Genius, and Obsession in the World of Competitive Scrabble.
Competitive Scrabble, you see, is an intoxicating mash of testosterone, chance, individual effort,
hard training, complex numbers theory and language. Or, what a typical football game is like, or
the final days of a CAR project. Junkies mainlining anagrams. Stefan’s 2001 book might be the
only publication in recent memory that drew praise from both Will Shortz AND Frank DeFord. If
you’re lost by either of those names, call up your features editor or any sports columnist.

Aug. 31, 2004

“Nascar Site Packed,” Scott Morris and Scott North, The Daily Herald.
Important story focusing on how a 2-mile stretch of rural Washington actually
bustled with 17,000 people and that the trend of more home construction promised
to bump headlong into plans for a proposed NASCAR track. Why don’t more newspapers go
beyond civic boosterism to explore the real world consequences, good and bad, of building
mammoth arenas?

“High Schools in the Money Also Are Rich in Sports Titles,” Erik Brady and MaryJo
Sylwester, USA Today.
Unique and resonating piece about how wealthier public schools dominate state championships
across America. Laced with irony and strongly supported by superior
database analysis that drew on multiple sources of public information. Hope for the
underdog, it seems, lives in Rhode Island.
www.usatoday.com/sports/preps/2004-06-17-titles-1a-cover_x.htm
SELF-SERVING NOTE II: The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review used some of the same data sources
to explore how discrimination against young women athletes is more prevalent in poor school
districts, part of a long-term survey of Title IX violations in western Pennsylvania. “Second
String.”

April 11, 2004

“Runs, Not Victories, Keep Fans in Stands,” Anthony Spangler and Jeff Claassen,
Ft. Worth Star Telegram.
A very good snapshot of the sort of database work professional clubs do for marketing
purposes, the reporters found that it’s more important to have high scoring teams and
star athletes on the roster than winning ball clubs when it comes to selling tickets. Playoff
success had only short-term influences on wooing fans to the stands. Localize!
www.dfw.com/mld/dfw/news/8408486.htm
FINAL SELF-SERVING NOTE: The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review developed metrics
to measure the real revenues of National Hockey League clubs on the eve of a threatened
labor lockout. These sorts of analyses of revenue streams feature prominently in annual pieces by Forbes magazine and, of
course, by the franchises, unions and leagues themselves. “Teams Awaiting Financial Faceoff.”

April 11, 2003
Boston Globe.

“Ticket Demand Is High, But Are New Fenway Seats Worth Risk?” Bill Dedman,
What is it with April 11 and American League ticket stories? I smell collusion! Very
strong lede to match outstanding analysis. The story touches on the trend of retro ballpark owners
moving fans closer to the action, often placing premium ticket holders closer to the batter than the
pitcher. Frank discussion of the very low risk of being killed by a foul ball, but follows with the
revelation that several fans are hurt annually by swats going astray. To make the measurements at
ballparks nationwide, the Globe dispatched a phalanx of math teachers.

“It’s Fourth Down and What Does the Bellman Equation Say? A Dynamic

Programming Analysis of Football Strategy,” David Romer, University of California,
Berkeley.
OK, it’s not a newspaper project. But it should’ve been! The author analyzed every regular season NFL game from 1998 –
2000 to illustrate bad decisions coaches make on fourth down. Should they punt? Should they kick a field goal? Should
they go for it? It’s a conundrum with which readers grapple every Sunday. Next time a columnist blathers on about how
ol’ coach should have punted, you just tell him, “Ei Di(gt) Vi = Pgt + Bgt Ei Di(gt+1) Vi - egt !”

RUNNER UP: “Hierarchical Models for Permutations: Analysis of Auto Racing Results,” March 3, 2003, by Todd
Graves, C. Shane Reese and Mark Fitzgerald.
Authors propose a Bayesian hierarchical way to judge the results of NASCAR races. Jeff Gordon is “a statistically
dominant figure.” Go 24! Professor Reese even does updates for the Busch (minor league) Series, Craftsman Truck

Series, et al., at madison.byu.edu/racing/racing.html. For those of you familiar with food dangers, toxic risks, etc., you’ll
like the discussion of Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling analysis.
REASON WHY HE’S RUNNER UP: A final 2003 computer analysis by Reese put Miami of Ohio as the best football
team in the country heading into the bowls. Although he apologized for this anomaly, it can’t be excused.
THIRD PLACE: Journal of Combative Sports, January 2001, “A Statistical Analysis of National Team Scores in
