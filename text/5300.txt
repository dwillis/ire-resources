A TEST: ASK ME
ABOUT
THIS COURSE

2017-08-04

The Three Types of Interviews

ACCOUNTABILITY

How guilty did you feel that you were drunk
at the wheel in the crash that killed her?

EMOTION

What did her loss mean to you?
YOU NEED
TO THINK ABOUT NOT JUST
THE QUESTIONS,
BUT THE TYPE OF INTERVIEW
YOU ARE DOING…

INFORMATION
When did you first learn your daughter
was killed in the car accident?

The 4 C’s:

The Basic
Rules
for Good
Interviews

»Character
The protagonist

»Context
What you need to know
Why you should care

»Conflict
The guts of the story

»Conclusion
What happens next …
the lessons learned
[more tomorrow]

1. ASK OPEN-ENDED
NOT CLOSED QUESTIONS:

You get the answers you deserve
• Don’t blame the
interviewee
• Ask a stupid question,
you get a stupid answer
So how can we ask smarter questions?

(c) www.juliansher.com

• ASK - WHAT, WHO?
HOW?
WHY?
WHEN?
• AVOID
YES/NO ANSWERS

2. DON'T GIVE PEOPLE
EASY ESCAPE ROUTES:

• AVOID THE DOUBLE-BARRELLED QUESTION
• OTHER WAYS TO LET THEM OFF THE HOOK:
• DIRECT WAY OUT – TWO CHOICES
• UNNEEDED ADJECTIVE OR PHRASE
• UNNEEDED FACT

Why didn’t Obama arm the Syrian rebels?
We’ll never know with this question that gives him an
escape… by adding just seven unnecessary words at the end

Since you were involved in this Tuesday night as well -- giving a blanket answer,
saying at the time ‘It was all him’ regarding deputy AG Rod Rosenstein ….
1/ Why did you come out with information that was later contradicted by the
President two days later ?
2/ … Could you explain the tick-tock?
3/ …When were you brought in?
4/ … Who else was involved?
5/ … Why were the American people given incorrect information that night?

your mouth…

3. BASIC IS BEAUTIFUL - KEEP IT
CLEAN AND SIMPLE
AVOID LOADED OR
CONTROVERSIAL
WORDS…

• STOP TALKING!!!!

Mr. Mayor – have you
not become the most
hated and corrupt
politician in town?

4. THE WORST QUESTION IS NOT
ASKING ONE
• AVOID MAKING STATEMENTS, OPINIONS
OR GETTING INTO A DEBATE*

Isn’t that what all
climate change
deniers say?
Are you doing enough
to stop radical Islam
in your mosque?
*UNLESS IT’S PART OF A WELL-PLANNED STRATEGY
