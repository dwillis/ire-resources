A Houston Chronicle investigation found that numerous
facilities throughout Houston, the capital of the
petrochemical industry, aren’t careful about the harmful
chemicals held in their warehouses
Hundreds of chemicals pose serious threats to the lives of
people living near these facilities, which are not regularly
inspected, unless an accident or a complaint is placed
The facilities also police themselves, regulations aren't
functional, accidents are rarely investigated,
communication with Houston's fire departments is weak
and chemicals are often transported through heavily
populated areas

A Tampa Bay Times investigation found that Walmarts
in Tampa Bay excessively call the police for any number
of problems, and do so far more often than other
retailers
It also found that Walmart relies on the police as a
security measure, and have minimal security of their own
All of these phone calls and police visits are also racking
up a hefty bill for taxpayers and cause a strain on police
departments

➔ Buzzfeed News and the
BBC found cases of
widespread match-fixing
throughout the world of pro
tennis
➔ It also found that tennis
authorities turned a blind
eye to the fixing for years
and extensive gambling
syndicates manipulated
matches

➔ The Reveal team followed three different
fires in Northern California
➔ Using satellite data, the investigation
followed how the fires burned, how
extensive they were and how the fires
have shaped the future of firefighting

➔ A Dallas Morning News investigation went
through the scale of how many refugees have
settled in Texas, which has the highest amount
of refugees than any other state
➔ Their investigation also explains the rigorous
vetting process that a refugee must go through
before coming to the US

➔

➔

➔

A Buzzfeed News investigation found that the
FBI and Homeland Security use planes equipped
with cameras, "augmented reality" and cell
phone trackers in order to monitor U.S. cities
from the air
It also found that planes tended to focus on
neighborhoods with higher Muslim
concentrations, especially neighborhood
mosques and other areas that have a majority
Muslim concentration
Surveillance also significantly drops on
weekends

An Atlanta Journal-Constitution investigation
found multiple cases of doctors sexually
abusing patients throughout the United
States
Many doctors would not only never be
punished, but they would be allowed to
continue practicing medicine
They combed through 100,000 documents
with data scrapers and used various
keywords to uncover multiple cases of sexual
misconduct in all 50 states

In a state where 38% of the population is Hispanic,
only 10% of Texas’ mayors, county commissioners
and judges are Latino. The Statesman’s
investigation looked at data on:
◆
◆
◆

The entire Hispanic Texas population
Latino representation on local government and in courts
The Hispanic citizen voting-age population

When they do try to run and hold office, Latino
candidates and officials are often resisted and
opponents try to throw them out of office
➔ Without representation, Latino communities often
do not have their issues taken seriously and
therefore avoid getting involved with local politics

➔

➔

An International Consortium of International
Journalists investigation sorted through leaked
documents and data to reveal the offshore financial
holdings of elected and public officials, former and
current world leaders and many other public figures
It revealed deals shrouded in secrecy committed by
banks, firms and companies in order to stash
financial holdings in offshore havens and make
them nearly impossible to trace

The Brooklyn Voter Purge
➔

➔

➔

A WNYC investigation found that a
large voter purge happened in
Brooklyn, and the majority of voters
purged were Hispanic
WNYC found that Hispanic voters
in Brooklyn were disproportionately
removed from voter rolls
They broke down the purged voters
by age, the time at which they
registered and party registration

Can big data stop bad cops?

➔

A Washington Post investigation found that
police departments failed to intervene and
address troubled officers in their systems
It also found that at the times they do
intervene, the process is inadequate and rarely
disciplines officers

Inspired by a series of Post-Dispatch editorials titled
"A Greater St Louis," the paper wanted to find a way to
dissolve the city's vast divisions and work towards a
unified St. Louis
They complied Census (American Community Survey)
data on all of St Louis' neighborhoods, such as race
proportions, per capita income and population size
They created an interactive site that allows the users
to move communities together to find ways to
improve certain issues facing the city and improve
racial and economic disparities

A Sarasota Herald-Tribune investigation
found that black people throughout
Florida are treated far more harshly than
white people in the state's justice system
Black people are frequently found more
guilty, get more jail time and are served
more severe sentences, especially when
it comes to felony drugs, robbery and
battery
The judges who hear these cases are
also more likely to be a white man; out of
the over 900 judges within Florida, only
62 of them are black

Title I: Rich School Districts Get Millions Meant
for Poor Kids
➔

➔

➔

Title I is a federal education program designed
to financially bolster school districts with larger
proportions of poor children, in order to ensure
that they are receiving a good education
However, in Virginia, a US News and World
Report investigation found that 20% of the
state's Title I money goes to school districts
with higher proportions of wealthy children
Thanks to outdated formulas, richer districts
get more Title I money than impoverish
districts, especially those that are less dense
but have higher concentrations of poverty

How much does your vote count?
➔

➔

➔

➔

A Fusion investigation used demographic data of
American voters to determine just how much and
how powerful their vote was during election
season
It used this data to determine a "power score" for
voters, which is determined by age, gender,
ethnicity, and where they live
It also reflects the general competitiveness of their
state, turnout rates for their demographic and the
statistical chance that their group would have an
effect on election results
The goal was to better understand how the
American election system impacts the voting
power of different demographics in this country

A Reveal investigation found that the
wealthy neighborhood Bel Air is the
biggest residential water consumer
in all of California
Despite a statewide drought crisis
and state efforts to reduce water use,
many affluent communities are using
excessive amounts of water and
have yet to be reprimanded while
members of lower income
communities have been fined for
hosing their driveways and broken
sprinkler heads.

A Bay Area News Group investigation found that since
2010, 944 guns have disappeared from California police
officers throughout the state
It found that there’s a lack of legislation on how officers
should store their guns, a struggle within departments
to keep track of their weapons and an alarming lack of
discipline for officers who lose their guns
Bay Area News Group built a gun database that tracks
lost and found law enforcement weapons throughout
California

A Chicago Reporter investigation, with help from INN, found
that the Chicago Police Department paid out $210 million in
settlements for 943 lawsuits over a four-year period for
police misconduct cases
Most of these cases are daily instances of excessive policing
in black and Latino communities and most were illegal
searches and seizures, false arrests and involved excessive
uses of force
The Chicago Reporter put together a database of all the
court cases it was able to compile

The Naples Daily News investigation explored the state of
Florida’s beaches, and how little the state invests in its
protection while development is allowed at a rapid pace
A lack of investment has resulted in Florida’s coastline receding
and local governments are burdened with managing erosion
Florida's lawmakers and governors typically return less than $1
to the shore each year for every $100 they take
Reporters created a dataset that allowed them to look at every
local government’s request for state assistance for beach
projects and used the funding requests report data with annual
contract status report records DEP maintains.

The Texas Tribune went through
over six years of Texas police
records to form Texas' first ever
accounting of police shootings
This collection revealed that Texas'
record-keeping is spotty and
sporadic
The Tribune's investigation even
uncovered shootings that hadn't
turned up in public records

➔

➔

An American Public Media investigation
revealed how law enforcement mishandled
one of the most notorious child abductions in
the country
Those failures also fueled national anxiety
about stranger danger, led to the nation's
sex-offender registries and raised questions
about crime-solving effectiveness and
accountability

An analysis by the Chicago Tribune reveals
that for years, the Cook County property tax
system created an unequal burden on
residents, handing huge financial breaks to
the well-off while punishing those who have
the least, particularly people living in
minority communities.

million property tax records from the years
2003 through 2015, along with thousands of
pages of documents.

A New York Times investigation looked at how
Antarctica’s rapid disintegration and its
unstable ice sheet are causing sea levels to
rise dramatically throughout the world
However, scientists struggle to determine just
how quickly the melting ice sheet will cause
sea levels to rise
The investigation also looked at how
scientists are trying to understand how much
human factors play a role in Antarctica’s
disintegration

As a continued part of its investigation into machine racial
bias, ProPublica found that minority communities in
Illinois, California, Texas and Missouri pay higher car
insurance premiums than white communities with the
same amount of risk
Insurers, like Allstate, Geico and Liberty Mutual charged
premiums that were an average 30 percent higher in zip
codes with more minorities than whiter communities with
similar accident costs

A Los Angeles Times investigation found that California has a large glut of power, to the point
the state’s power plants will produce 21 percent more electricity than it needs by 2020, not
including solar panel energy
Californians have to pay higher premiums for their electric bills to cover the expenses of new
plants whose power isn’t needed, paying $6.8 billion more than necessary
Utilities companies continue to build plants in CA because they are guaranteed a profit
regardless of how much power they sell
