Clues for Finding Disturbances in the Marine Ecosystem
1) Lumps of black waste found in crab traps.
2) Crab shells spotted with black strains.
=> Blackening Syndrome: 10% of crabs which live in the sludge of ocean dumping sites show
this phenomenon (Sawyer’s paper on dumping sites in New York and Philadelphia, 1984).
3) Animal hairs on the crabs.

How Did I Start My Investigation?
1) Hearsay among researchers in the fields of fisheries and marine ecosystems.
2) Testimonies of fishermen who caught the crabs around the ocean dumping site. I was also
told that the fishermen submitted a petition to the Ministry of Maritime Affairs & Fisheries and
the Ministry of Environment.
3) Obtaining the digested version of the first field assessment of the dumping site.
4) Interpretation of hidden codes on restricted contamination data.
- Looking into the theses on the ecosystem of ocean dumping sites. In particular, I referred to
the aquatic environment monitoring report and the fisheries research technical reports of
England from the 1980’s to 1990’s. (www.cefastechnology.co.uk)
- Investigating the risk of toxic heavy metals and endocrine disruptors.
(www.iarc.fr/ENG/Databases/index.php)
-Investigating the guidelines for the control of shellfish. (www.cfsan.fda.gov/~ear/nss242d.html)

Investigation Method for My Report
1. Deep sea probing with the help of the Korean Ocean Research Institute.
- Picking up sediment from a depth of 1,800 m at the dumping site.
- Analyzing the contamination of the sediment.
- Risk assessment of the toxic heavy metals and PCB.
2. Testing for organic contamination.

- Collecting samples of living organisms, such as crabs and cowries, from the seabed of the
dumping site.
- Asking the most prominent civil toxic analysis institution to test the organic samples.
- Interpretation of the contamination data with the help of university toxicologists and hygienists.
3. Chasing the contaminated sludge.
- Doing a reverse investigation of toxic matter to introduce a possible source in the report.
- Finding the reason factories and local governments prefer the option of ocean dumping.

Shockwave from The Investigation
- Demonstration by fishermen to the government.
- Emergency meeting of related Ministries on ocean dumping in the government.
- Revision of Marine Conservation Law and Waste Management Law to ban the dumping of
sewage sludge and animal waste in the ocean.
- Planning for the reduction of the amount of ocean dumping and compensation for fishermen.
