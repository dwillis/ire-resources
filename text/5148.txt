Digging for data and docs
and meeting access
Getting more by spending
less
How to work with public agencies to unearth data
and documents without spending major $$$$$$ and
enforce compliance with open meetings laws

Work your beat, get to know the gatekeepers before
you need something from them
Find out what they regularly collect and if there are any specific exemptions to
disclosure. Learn about their retentions rules, and actual schedule
Ask first, record date, then put in writing and refer to original request
Carry a flash drive in case they can quickly comply
Figure out who else might have the same info: licensing bureaus, corrections
agencies, public/private partnerships
Find out who reviews your request and go talk to that person before you formally
file
Let community officials and residents know what you are asking for; write a story
if you are stymied

What happens when they turn me down or ask for
too much money?
Find out what the hangup is and if you can negotiate or narrow request
Ask for everything electronically, and flash that flash drive
Offer to sit down and review documents in their office
Ask for itemized cost of fulfilling request and explanation of each item
Contact state public access counselor, if your state has one (too few do)

What can I get?
Enforcement records
Pet licenses, but not in Utah
Use and occupancy licenses
Health inspection reports
Nursing home inspection reports
Day care licensing and inspection reports
Public/private deals and details

What can I get - contd

awarded the contracts
