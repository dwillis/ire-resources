Creating a Freelance Newsroom
Cat Ferguson

Make a Workspace That Works For You
(Not Against You)
Get a desk.
Ignore ergonomics at your peril.
Set up a good filing system. The floor is a bad filing system.
Stock your supply closet. Anything you really use, find it a
permanent home.
● Make it pleasant! Plants, art, whatever.
●

Ignore ergonomics at your peril.

Find Your People
● Look for listservs, local journalism groups, go to Meetups,
etc.
● Miserable and lonely? Try to find a coworking space (if
you’re less miserable, you’ll be more productive).
● Leave the house and talk to one non-work person every day.
● Don’t be afraid to ask friends for help, work or otherwise.

Find a Mentor – Or Two
● Keep in touch with people you meet at conferences,
editors you liked working with, old professors.
● Reach out to people you don’t know, but respect their
time.
● One person doesn’t need to do everything.
● Get them on the phone.

Find Your Resources
Keep a list of free or cheap databases (see tipsheet).
U S E T H E L I B R A R Y. Public ones, law libraries, etc.
Libraries have researchers!
Make friends with P.I.’s, lawyers, and students with
access to journals/school libraries.
● Make joint accounts with other freelancers.
●
●
●
●

Give Yourself Permission to Take Breaks
● Stretch every 30 minutes. Leave your desk for lunch.
● Don’t go from bed to work to bed.
● You don’t have to change out of PJs, but do please
brush your teeth.
● Take vacations, nights, and weekends.
● Say no (especially to editors).
● It’s not lazy. It’s healthy. Don’t burn out.

Building Relationships
With Editors
Hilary Niles
@nilesmedia

How to get editors to trust you with
investigative work: Don’t start with
investigative work.
● Demonstrate you can deliver clean copy on time.
● Create a chance to show sound news judgement,
ability to source.

How to know what editors to trust with
investigative work: Don’t start with
investigative work.
● Learn their strengths and process to find out if you
work well together.
● Get to know their news judgment and willingness to
stand behind you.

Stories to cultivate grounds for trust
● Don’t tread on staff reporters’ beats.
● When big news breaks, pivot.
● Start reporting your way into the topic of your
investigation. This builds knowledge, sources, leads.

Trust but verify: Contracts

How to pitch a story without giving it
away?
Option 1:
"I have data that shows the New York Police Department has arrested 1,345
people for putting their feet up on the subway since 2010."

How to pitch a story without giving it
away?
Do

Don't

Be specific enough that you know you know
what you're talking about

Give them the actual data, documents or name
of source

Be vague enough that they can't replicate
your research

Give away the source, if at all possible

Make sure it's original
