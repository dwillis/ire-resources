Security Perceptions and Practices
What is the security culture of journalism?
Interviews with 16 journalists in Canada
Staff vs. Freelance
Investigative vs. Non-investigative

Security Mindsets
The work that I do is not necessarily...hard hitting,
investigative...kind of Watergate-style journalism...I’m more just,
you know sort of checking in with the pulse of the city and looking into
issues that some people are publicly raising
[digital security has] just never really come up because it
is not something that sources are particularly concerned
about vis--vis the kinds of stories that I’m writing

Investigative vs. Non-investigative Threat
Models
Investigative Threats: Surveillance and legal actions from law
enforcement and intelligence agencies
Non-investigative Threats: Surveillance, harassment and legal
actions from companies and individuals

Holistic Security: Across the Profession

“I’ve heard this for years – for people who don’t deal with
sensitive stuff...I remember I had an education reporter once ask
me, like “why should I care about [security]. I’m just reporting
on education”...I think that is a hump that we still need to get over”

Holistic Security: Within Newsrooms

“you’ve amassed a team of people any one of whom could
be a weak link. Your information can only be protected when
your co-workers want it to be protected – especially when you’re
working in a company where not everyone is a journalist or not
everyone is practising good cybersecurity practices”

Digital Security: Responsibility and
Opportunity
Responsibility: Protect sources, newsroom, colleagues
Opportunity: Increase range of stories you can cover
