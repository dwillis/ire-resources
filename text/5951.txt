UNDER PRESSURE
TIPSHEET
FOR BREAKING NEWS AND DAILY TURNS

Don’t just Grandstand

• Be OPEN to possibilities
ASK:
What don’t we know after the obvious
“nuts and bolts”?

know? What should they know?
What would help viewers/readers
understand this event more (put into

questions.

analyze?

• What value could it provide to our
coverage?

DO
• Find relationships; put event into context

when breaking news hits

• Keep adding to that folder
• Use databases often
• Push yourself to do something different
once a month or once a quarter
• Try using data and responding BEFORE
event happens
• Practice, practice, practice
DON’T
• Rush to judgment
• In the effort to get on the air\publish forget
to ask basic who, what, where, why AND
how did I get this information? questions

doesn’t triple check again
• NOT question your sources and their
motivations just like you do on “normal

on

KNOW
• Know building & construction databases
• Know who’s responsible for what
• Know resources you can access quickly
and efficiently
• Know where to look
• Know what to look for
• How to turn data into interesting copy
PRACTICE
• Breaking data from non-breaking stories
• Digging into these types of stories from
time to time even if you don’t actually use
it on the air or in a story
• Using databases in your spare time

• Exercises and deadlines
BUILD
• Database library on your own
• Knowledge of where and how to get data
• Favorites folders with quick sites to use in
a hurry
• Lists of contacts and resources
• Team approach where all ‘get it’

From A to Z
TIPSHEET

How DID you get THAT on the air?

“Find ways to make your story become
extraordinary.”
Robert Campos

Start by taking some time and think:
1. Is this story worth an investigation? Not all
potential stories are.
a. Is there a victim? – It’s normally not worth an
investigation unless someone is getting hurt
(physically, financially, emotionally).
b. Could it happen to me? – In short, how many of our
viewers can relate to the problem? It could be
because they’ve had a similar experience -- or
because it’s a rare, but serious, event that could
strike any of us. In short, will viewers empathize
with the situation?
c. Is someone allegedly at fault? – For example, a
fatal auto accident is a tragedy; it’s an investigation
if an automaker may be to blame for covering up a
defective part that caused it.
d. Is there evidence? – People complain about stuff all
the time, but we can’t do much unless there’s a way
to verify their claims. Are there witnesses, pictures,
paperwork – or, better yet, can we see it happen for
ourselves?
e. Is what’s happening fundamentally
unfair/wrong? – In short, would most viewers be
angered/outraged when they hear the story – or
would they just shrug?

2. GET IN A DATA STATE OF MIND

3. Request the full data set
a. Owner’s name & address
b. Property type
c. Dollar amount
d. Holder’s name & address
e. *Most recent claim date
4. Interview your data
a. Who has the most money sitting in unclaimed
property?(Then, go find them!)
b. What cities have a lot of money in unclaimed
property? Remember, this is local taxpayer
money that is tied up at the state level.
c. What about non-profits? Are they aware they
have thousands of dollars sitting in a stateowned bank account waiting to be claimed?
5. Remember, there’s more than one way to skin a cat
(or get data)!
a. If Victim’s names redacted:
i. Check trial witness lists (match initials
from criminal complaint)
ii. Check civil court filings for suspect
iii. Look for OFP - Orders for Protection
(who being protected?)
iv. Damages and restitution claims (who is the
plaintiff??)

b. If records not considered public:
i. Who else has them or can get them?
(private attorneys, victims themselves)
ii. We asked Jodel & her mom to file an open
records request for all her own case files
including video & audio.
6. Google person’s name with word “obituary” or
“memorial”
7. Use Nexis, Accurint, Spokeo to find phone numbers
8. Search social media and USE social media to
connect
9. Be prepared to work with a very large data set.
a. Don’t have the necessary data skills? Consider
taking an IRE hands-on class to learn Excel
and/or SQL.
b. Find someone at your station who knows how
to work with an Excel spreadsheet. (Your sales
department might be a good place to start!)
10. If your goal is to find people who are unaware they
have unclaimed property:
a. Narrow your focus by eliminating properties
that have a “most recent claim date”. This will
help you weed out people who already know
they have unclaimed property.

b. Narrow your focus by dollar amounts. The
sweet spot is $5,000 and less. There are
exceptions, but generally most people with
more than $5,000 in unclaimed property
probably already know about it.
11.
Don’t make any promises – Don’t tell
someone they are going to get the money because
you can’t guarantee that. Why? They might run into
trouble with the state trying to claim it. (i.e.
sometimes people don’t have the necessary
documentation to prove heirship, etc.)
12. Lay the Foundation
a. What do I want to know about this topic/
issue that hasn’t been told/revealed before?
b. What don’t I know after the ‘obvious’?
c. What is knowable? Is unknown achievable?
d. Challenge assumptions
e. Challenge conventional wisdom
f. Who is accountable?
g. Have they been held to account?
13. Start Building
a. Sum up your story’s thesis/thrust in three
words?
b. Noun (complication)
c. Active verb (development or action)
d. Noun (resolution)

e. 3-Word active statement leads complication
to resolution
14. Begin Reporting…Gather and Think
a. Create a DATA state of mind
b. What data do I need? Where can I find it? Get
it?
c. What paperwork do I need? Reports, research,
scientific work, government watchdog material,
government reports
d. What FOIA’s or CPRA’s should I file?
e. Who are the stakeholders? Who hasn’t talked?
Who MUST I talk to?
f. Who are my characters? My MAIN characters?
g. What must I do to put this into CONTEXT?
15. Increase Reporting and begin Framing
a. Talk to people
b. Do pre-interviews
c. Look through data
d. Look at data again – try other answers
e. Hold yourself accountable
f. If you get stuck, report your way out
g. Start a FRAMEWORK for your story
16. Begin Writing
a. Refer to your FRAMEWORK
b. Start thinking about your characters

c. How do characters relate to your
FRAMEWORK?
d. How does data, paperwork, FOIA’s relate?
e. What visuals do you need?
f. Who must be held to account?
g. Set up interviews
17. Writing, Editing, Finish
a. Start shooting
b. Do interviews with characters and stakeholders
c. Shoot video and pictures with natural sound
and emotion
d. Write outline, beginning, middle, end
e. Edit, edit, edit
18. Don’t rush to move on from a story.
19. What questions still need to be answered, is there
more to be explored?
20. Follow the money! Find characters and tell story
through them!
