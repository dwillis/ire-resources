COVERING JUSTICE IN EUROPE AND THE US

LEO SISTI

THE PROSECUTOR IS THE ENGINE OF AN INVESTIGATION
• ONCE A CRIMINAL NOTICE REACHES A PROSECUTOR DIRECTLY
OR THROUGH INVESTIGATORS, A PROSECUTOR IS OBLIGED TO
BEGIN AN INVESTIGATION. THIS DOESN’T OCCUR IN FRANCE, UK,
US WHERE PROSECUTORS HAVE FAR MORE LEEWAY TO DECIDE
WHETHER TO PURSUE A CRIMINAL CHARGE.
• THE RIGHT MAN FOR REPORTERS TO TALK TO IN ITALY, THE GUY
WHO KNOWS EVERYTHING ON INVESTIGATIONS, IS THE
PROSECUTOR. HE IS THE DIRECTOR OF A PRELIMINARY CRIMINAL
INVESTIGATION, HE IS A REAL “ENGINE”. POLICEMEN,
CARABINIERI, A SPECIAL FORCE OF THE ARMY, AND TREASURY
POLICEMEN (GUARDIA DI FINANZA), WHILE RUNNING AN
INVESTIGATION, DEPEND ON HIM AND ARE NOT ENTITLED TO
REPORT ANY RESULT OF THAT TO THEIR RESPECTIVE HEADS OF
POLICE, CARABINIERI OR GUARDIA DI FINANZA.

THE ABU OMAR CASE
• TO BETTER EXPLAIN HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS LET ME MENTION
A FAMOUS CASE I WROTE ON A LOT FOR THE MAGAZINE
“L’ESPRESSO”: ABU OMAR, AN EGYPTIAN CLERIC WHO ON 2003
WAS ABDUCTED IN A STREET OF MILAN IN AN OPERATION OF
“EXTRAORDINARY RENDITION” PERFORMED BY 22 CIA AGENTS
AND, ACCORDING TO ALLEGATIONS, ITALIAN INTELLIGENCE
OFFICERS OF SISMI. MONTHS LATER ARREST WARRANTS WERE
ISSUED AGAINST ALL THE PRESUMED PERPETRATORS: CIA AND
SISMI AGENTS.BUT THE CIA AGENTS HAD ALREADY FLED THE
COUNTRY AND NOBODY OF THEM WAS ARRESTED.

HOW COULD I WRITE ON THIS MATTER? PROSECUTORS DON’T
GIVE OUT DOCUMENTS, THEY COULD BE ARRESTED BEING
PUBLIC OFFICIALS. NEVERTHELESS THEY ARE AVAILABLE, FROM
THEM YOU CAN GET HINTS, HELPFUL TO TRACK DOWN WHO
HOLD ARREST WARRANTS AND WIRETAPPINGS USUALLY
INCLUDED IN THOSE PAPERS.

WITNESSES AND ATTORNEYS
• OTHER POSSIBLE ROUTES I EXPLORED WAS TO CONTACT A
DEPUTY IMAM, WHO WAS WORKING AT THE MILAN MOSQUE IN
VIALE JENNER. HIS NAME IS MOHAMMED REDA. HE GOT NEWS
FROM A MUSLIM WOMAN WHO ATTENDED THE SAME MOSQUE
AND WITNESSED THE CRIME SCENE WHERE ABU OMAR WAS
KIDNAPPED. SOON ABU OMAR’S WIFE STARTED INVESTIGATING
AND FILED A REPORT TO THE POLICE. SO THE FIRST
INFORMATION I GOT CAME FROM INSIDE THE MUSLIM WORLD.
• ATTORNEY COULD BE A FAST TRACK TO OBTAIN ARREST
WARRANTS. THEY ARE ENTITLED TO GET A TEXT OF THE ARREST
WARRANT OUTLINING THE CHARGES AND OFTEN CONTAINING
WIRETAPPINGS.

POLICEMEN AND ATTORNEYS
• ANOTHER ROUTE IS TO CONTACT THE INVESTIGATORS:
POLICEMEN, FINANCIAL POLICE, CARABINIERI. THEY HELP
PROSECUTORS WHO RUN AN INVESTIGATION. AND THEY HAVE
ALL THE DOCUMENTS A REPORTER IS LOOKING FOR.
• A FUNNY THING HAPPENED IN THE ABU OMAR CASE. ITALIAN
MEDIA GOT THOSE DOCUMENTS FROM ATTORNEYS WHILE
AMERICAN COLLEAGUES WERE FORCED TO ASK FOR HELP TO
THE ITALIANS. OF COURSE ATTORNEYS CAN, BUT NOT ALWAYS
PROVIDE REPORTERS WITH DOCUMENTS. IT DEPENDS MAINLY ON
THE “HUMAN TOUCH”. SO EVERY JOURNALIST MUST BE ABLE TO
MAKE CONTACTS WITH THEM. A GOOD SUGGESTION IS TO GET TO
THE COURT EVERY DAY, MEET THEM IN A FRIENDLY WAY, A
CLAP ON THE BACK, DRINKING COFFEE OR HAVING LUNCH WITH
THEM.

ATTORNEYS ARE THE KEY
• ONCE YOU HAVE PLANTED THE SEEDS OF FRIENDSHIP WITH AN
ATTORNEY IT’S TIME TO “HARVEST THE GRAIN”.
• AND WHEN YOU WRITE A PIECE, DON’T FORGET TO MENTION THE
NAME OF THE ATTORNEY, IF HE WANTS PUBLICITY, WHO HELPED
YOU. THIS IS THE REAL SECRET!

FINAL COMMENT
• THE ABU OMAR CASE IS NOT YET ENDED.
• THE FIRST VERDICT WAS ISSUED BY A MILAN COURT ON 2009
WITH CONVICTIONS RANGING FROM 5 AND 7 YEARS FOR THE CIA
AGENTS IN ABSENTIA. THE MILAN APPEALS COURT HANDED
DOWN ITS SENTENCE ON 2010 WITH WORSE CONVICTIONS FROM 7
T0 9 YEARS.
• ON JUNE 12 2012 THE SUPREME COURT HAD TO ISSUE ITS FINAL
RULING, BUT DECIDED TO POSTPONE THE CASE UNTIL JULY 13.
NINE YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE ABU OMAR WAS
KIDNAPPED.THIS IS THE RESULT OF A LENGHTY SYSTEM. A
SYSTEM WHERE AT THE END OF 2011 THE BACKLOG OF TRIALS
REACHED THE BULK OF 3.5 MILLION. IT’S THE SYSTEM I
DESCRIBED IN MY BOOK JUST PUBLISHED IN ITALY: “TRIAL
ITALIAN STYLE” (”PROCESSO ALL’ITALIANA”).
