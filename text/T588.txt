How to get human sources on the Net
There are three main ways to get human sources out of the Net
- By consulting Web directories
- By checking out forums and discussion groups
- By going behind Web sites
WEB DIRECTORIES
Activists around the world
If you’re working on an issue usually monitored by non profit organizations, the first
human source you may want to contact is an NGO staff: they are usually eager to give
journalists information and phone numbers.
www.idealist.org
Idealist is a database of NGOs in 165 countries, searchable by country or by topic. It
provides name, address, phone number and e-mail to contact each organization.
Web sites of NGOs that operate around the world usually provide contact information
for offices in all countries.

www.greenpeace.org
Journalists around the world
Many international media organizations provides e-mail addresses or phone numbers
of their members around the world

Government people
Internet allows you to find government people in a heartbeat:

The US Government Directory provides you with the phone numbers of every public
officer working for federal and state government, from congressmen to agency
people.
www.gksoft.com/govt/en/world.html
This directory links to the homepage of each department or ministry of all countries in
the world.

Finding people by address
If you need to contact a person according to his/her specific location (because of a
crime, an accident, an health infection and so on) you can check on phone directories
that offer this reverse function.

FORUM OR DISCUSSION GROUPS
If you need personal stories on a specific issue a good way is to check out forum or
discussion groups reserved to the category of people you’re looking for. You can read
what participants say and contact them by e-mail. Double-check their identities.
