IRE 2019

Key question:
How often does this happen?

First stop: Federal data

phmsa.dot.gov
-

Explosions, accidents & other incidents
Pipes installed by decade
Pipes by type (plastic, steel, cast iron, etc.)
Company info (total miles of pipe, number & cause of
leaks)

Source: PHMSA Cast & Wrought Iron Inventory

By operator - Texas

Source: PHMSA Cast & Wrought Iron Inventory

PHMSA doesn’t track the
kind of pipes that run
down your alleys and
streets.
We asked Atmos for a map
of its pipes in Dallas
County.
They gave us a map of
Dallas city - in PDF.

Next stop: State data

- State agencies oversee intrastate pipelines
- They handle regulations, inspections & enforcements
- Find your state agency at
primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/states.htm

State records requests

-

Pipeline inspections & investigations
Safety citations (“alleged violations”)
Cases referred for enforcement
Fines issued
Semi-annual leak reports

Case dismissed

Other records
-

Lawsuits
Police & ﬁre reports
City permits
Campaign contributions
Emails & text messages
Company earnings reports

Court records

(Most settlements are conﬁdential, a few aren’t)

Fire department reports

Advice
-

Build a timeline
Keep painfully detailed spreadsheets
Document Cloud is your friend
Do the drive (or walk) by
Instead of sending questions, try a memo summarizing
your ﬁndings
