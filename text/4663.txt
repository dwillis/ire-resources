Should we all do this with complex analysis?

Do we have time?

Does this help most readers
understand what we did to the data?

#nicarmethods

What is the goal for doing this?

Methodology: The core metaphor relies on an analogy between the center of
mass, ( ∑ mass * position ) / total mass, and net asset value, ( ∑ shares *
price ) / total shares. The rate of change of stocks follows a log-normal
random walk, which is smooth only for the sake of usability; for a more
realistic (rougher and nowhere-differentiable) model, consider fractional
Brownian motion. The premium at which the ETF trades also follows a
random walk, weakly attracted to a fair 1:1 ratio. Market impact is simplistic
and linear; there is no bid-ask spread; the ETF rebalances continuously; and
the expense ratio is assumed to be negligible. Tweet at @tophtucker with
corrections or pedantry.

What parts of complex
analysis should we explain?

#nicarmethods

Are readers equipped to understand it?

#nicarmethods

And do they care?

Is there any harm for readers in
not explaining your methods?

Do readers have different expectations for
transparency depending on news org?
