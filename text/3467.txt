What is NodeXL?
A free template for Excel 2007 and 2010 that makes Social Network Analysis easy
for anyone familiar with basic spreadsheet functions.
What’s really cool: NodeXL has been optimized for analyzing online social media
– it includes built-in connections to query the APIs of Twitter, Flickr and YouTube,
allowing you to draw networks of users and their activity.

Thanks especially to:
• Marc Smith, Connected Action, for Twitter
network presented in these slides
• Ben Shneiderman, University of Maryland
