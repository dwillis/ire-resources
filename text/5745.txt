• Check in on stories that may
appear to be routine.

• Makes sure all the right questions
are being asked and appropriate
documents

• Better to cover all bases than miss

• If you “fact-check” stories when doing investigations – such
as line-by-line editing – be just as diligent with the data.

• Share the wealth. Make the data available to your entire

project is over. Crime, health care, property tax and
campaign finance databases are particularly good for sharing
throughout the newsroom and online for readers.
