Federal Audit Clearinghouse
data

What is it?
A collection of selected ﬁelds from Form SF-SAC ﬁlled out for Single Audits dating
from 1997 to present day. Single audits are performed annually on any entity that
expends $750,000 or more of federal awards. During an audit, the CPA must record
detailed information on the entity’s activities, including:
●
●

●
●

Basic identiﬁers: auditee name, city, state, contact info, CPA name, city, state, contact info
Federal awards: each program for which federal awards were expended, the amount expended for the
program, the federal awarding agency and whether the award was directly received or passed through
to other entities
Audit opinion on program compliance: questioned costs, material weaknesses, signiﬁcant deﬁciencies,
etc.
Audit opinion on ﬁnancial statement preparation: some states require that ﬁnancial statements be
prepared using a special framework

Where does it come from?
Single audit data is hosted on the Federal Audit Clearinghouse’s website,
https://harvester.census.gov/facweb/. The website contains both a database of
selected audit ﬁelds, as well as a selected number of complete audits (generally
dating back a couple years).

What are its shortcomings?
●
●
●
●
●

Federal policy has changed over time, so a number of ﬁelds are not populated
before a certain date
Given the above, sometimes ﬁelds are not populated correctly
Audits are grouped by employee identiﬁcation number (EIN) and auditee names
are not always consistent from year to year
Many of the ﬁles are extremely large, so doing a general analysis can be difﬁcult.
E.g. detailed federal program information is summarized in a 13GB CSV ﬁle!
A number of human entry errors (like negative awards???)

How can it be used?
Individual audits have been used to report on local stories about potential ﬁnancial
impropriety, including one about the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe in MA and another
about local government record keeping in Richmond, VA.

How can it be used?
A higher-level examination of the data set might yield interesting patterns that can
be followed up on with reporting
