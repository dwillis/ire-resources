My Last Talk was Deadly
• WARNING !
– Consult your physician

I Shoulda Minded my Brother
• "Every equation
cuts your
readership in half"
• Pop Quiz:
– What limit does

approach, as you
add equations?

This Time, I'm Prepared

Also: Don't Piss inside the Tent
• Journalists should
afflict the comfortable,
but not each other
• Stick to "How I got
that story…."

"…He interviewed 13 families—
and in two of the families there
were 11 children each—in a process
that took 17 months…."
"…I discovered over time that every
teenager I interviewed about how he
or she became a parent ….

Me Dumb !

• Not great at doing
numbers in my head

You Don't Know Much About…
Algebra ?
Don't worry:

Counting
Ratios (e.g. percentages)
That's all you need in business writing…
and in most businesses.

Scarcity and Substitutes
• How do people choose
among scarce
resources ?

Find the common
currency

What's the "currency" ?
What's the "currency" ?
– i..e., the best unit of measurement

• Constant 1990 Dollars?
• Price-to-Earnings?
It's all about ratios

GENERALLY SPEAKING
• MATH IS EXTREME GENERALIZATION
– MATHEMATICIANS ARE LAZY, THEY ONLY
WANT TO SOLVE A PROBLEM ONCE.

• JOURNALISTS WANNA SHOW GENERAL
SIGNIFICANCE OF STORY
– USUALLY UNEARNED

• MATH AND STATS HELP YOU KNOW IF
YOU'RE STORY IS TRUE, IN GENERAL

Words Can Fail Us
• "Large"…"Big"…
"More"…"Always"…
"Most"…
Be self-conscious
about using these
words glibly
• How much more?

• An large increase in
the price of gasoline
will cause a big drop
in demand.
• A 25% increase in the
price of gasoline will
cause a 15% drop in
demand.

DON'T USE NUMBERS FOR
THEIR OWN SAKE
Reporting:
• Did your source pull it out of the air ?
• Are you overstating its precision ?
Writing:
• Is your story becoming unreadable ?
• Will it help your readers in their decisions ?

The Seattle Times Drug Project: Drug researchers leak secrets to Wall St.

Sunday, August 7, 2005
This article has been revised from the original version to reflect information that appeared in a published clarification in the newspaper on Sept. 11, 2005.
Here is that clarification:
An Aug. 7 article reported that Dr. Ron Garren, who runs a hedge fund in Carmel, Calif., admits he pays doctors in an effort to get confidential details about
ongoing drug research. Garren's statements were apparently misunderstood. He discussed the practice of hedge funds -- including one for which he formerly
worked — paying doctors, including some involved in ongoing clinical trials, as consultants. But Garren says the firm he owns and operates now, Biotech
Insight Management LLC, does not do so.
The Aug. 7 article reported that The Times found at least 26 cases in which drug researchers involved in clinical trials leaked confidential details of ongoing
research to Wall Street firms. The total is accurate because Garren was not among the 26.

Selling Drug Secrets

Drug researchers leak secrets to Wall St.
By Luke Timmerman and David Heath
Seattle Times staff reporters
Doctors testing new drugs are sworn to keep their research secret until drug companies announce the final results. But elite Wall Street firms — looking to
make quick profits — have found a way to harvest these secrets:
They pay doctors to divulge the details early.
A Seattle Times investigation found at least 26 cases in which doctors have leaked confidential and critical details of their ongoing drug research to Wall
Street firms.
The practice involves doctors at top research universities from UCLA to the University of Pennsylvania, and powerful financial firms including Citigroup
Smith Barney, UBS and Wachovia Securities.

The Skinny On Doctors
AN IMPORTANT STORY APPEARED in the Seattle Times last month, on the scandalous way doctors take Wall
Street's money to discuss investigational drugs. Such consulting has gotten pervasive in recent years, and the
paper's Website showed it in a gorgeous package of graphics, source documents and audio clips. I just wish
they'd gotten more of the story right
