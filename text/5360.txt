LEARN FROM OUR FAILS
NICAR CONVERSATION
MARCH 8, 2018
What we have learned:
* Don’t pull all-nighter
* What to do when underlying data is wrong and you tweet it? (have some other check,
like a human)
* Note: blue = dem, red = gop
* Get your editor to say at the beginning if they want an interactive (plan ahead)
* Don’t overwrite scraped data (append instead)
* Consider writing in a failing/stopping in your automation code if there’s a chance
it’s screwed up
* Pay attention if you are copyediting
* Always count total number of records after joins
* Talk to the people who are providing the data (well in advance of publication)
* Computer science starts counting at 0 not 1
* Make a story out of the fail Ð like if the state keeps giving you trash data
* Look for outliers that skew the data
* Don’t publish big projects in December
* Don’t assume data is complete
* Do believe in your work É but do also check if you get a credible complaint
* Watch out for floating point errors
* Do double-check your math, against reality with a ruler
* Test on a real phone, not emulator
* You have to do copyediting on graphics, just like with text
* Test on a Lisa Simpson and a Bart Simpson (have both nerds and non-nerds look at
your graphics first)
* Disclose where reader data is going if you are collecting it
* Know/cultivate data custodians
* Expect the unexpected
* Look for none/null Ð or a false none/null, where they just leave out data
* Eight-year-old flash, well you can’t support it forever
* Document things! Especially if you’re the only person who knows how to do it
* Pick up the phone

* Show up in person
* Better to have yes/no questions for long-winded sources
* Reach out to other non-government orgs
* Call when someone else answers the phone
* Tell them you’ll report about lack of data
* Ask mom to read
* Check data year over year to help look for outliers or errors
* Use multiple data sources, that’s helpful to fill in gaps in the data
* Ask the sample size & margin of error
* Story idea: who’s your city’s database contractor and are they swindling your city,
asking $$$$ to export data?
* If they say they can’t export as csv, ask what their database is, look up the manual
and tell them how to export as csv
