WEBSITES:

Military personnel locator.
www.internment.net/
A searchable index of military personnel buried in National cemeteries. Data may includes date of birth,
date of death, service rank, city of residence.
www.militarybrats.com
A website frequented by children of military personnel. Site now requires registration.
A FEW TIPS:
Use every element of the record to help locate person you are seeking. The first 3 digits of a Social
Security number can lead to geographic location. Search a squadron number in people finder records.
Look for patterns and similarities when tracking down people who are of a group.
Get to know the locations of bases and training sites, and surrounding towns.
Remain persistent:
Small town public libraries may provide obituaries and next-of-kin. Archives and history
centers may store files of news clippings, official records, or memos.
Seek new leads from interviews: While searching for names of Harrier pilots and survivors,
reporters inquired about names of pilots involved in Harrier accidents, widow’s names, or their geographic
location.
Organization: Use a spreadsheet to sort out all known data and build a composite profile. Use it to track
progress.
