On The Beat:
Documents for Public Health Investigations
Vaccination law compliance audits: State laws require children attending public and private
schools – and often day care – to be vaccinated against many diseases. Audits are often done
about one month after the start of the school year, often just kindergarten and sixth grades may
be audited. Is the law being enforced? How many children have religious or medical
exemptions?
State mandated vaccines: http://www.immunize.org/laws/. What we found in Atlanta:

Immunization registry compliance records: Most states have immunization registries, to help
track the vaccines children have received, and in about 15 states, health care providers are
required by law to record all shots. But nationwide, only about 37% of private providers do.
Details about which states require reporting are at:

Examples of registry information can be useful: http://tinyurl.com/29qlgtt

Swimming pool closure reports: Ask local health departments for a copy of their database
that tracks swimming pool closures to identify pools with critical health violations. Paper files
may contain consumer complaints.

Code enforcement citations – rat & mosquito control: Kept (often on paper) by local
environmental health departments. Are certain properties being repeatedly cited for rat
infestations? Are they bank-owned foreclosures?
State notifiable disease databases: From salmonella and listeriosis to measles, whooping
cough and Lyme disease, states (and the CDC) require doctors and labs report all incidents of
certain diseases. There is some variation by state in what diseases must be reported to the
state health department. In Nevada, they are:

Prevention’s MMWR keeps national data: www.cdc.gov/mmwr.
Death certificate databases: Useful for finding victims when cross-referenced with notifiable
disease data. Beware: Ages, dates of birth or dates of death may be incorrect in one or both
data sets. So be prepared to look for near matches, not exact matches. Then seek releases
from families to access hospital records. Don’t forget autopsy reports, especially if the death
involves a child.
FDA Warning Letters: Great for spotting trends involving food or drug safety – and identifying
local examples. Can be viewed by regional FDA office.
