Tips from Anh Do:

- This does not need to be a whole beat. Elements of covering people or communities of color
can be infused into different beats in a fun, relevant and practical way. Think about what interests
you - and your audience. What gets energized clicks? What inspires engagement?
For example, if you cover City Hall, or small cities, who are the groups carving out communities
in your region? What issues keep them active? What traditions highlight their daily living?
Tip: To really understand a cultural group, we first need to learn their history. This doesn't have
to be dry or require reading multiple volumes from a library. You can touch on some of that but
also tap on Netflix, YouTube (images tell so much and are so riveting) and Facebook special
interest groups (this is such a cool resource - and the names are all there to add to your rainbow
e-Rolodex.)
Anecdote: In placing a lot of my focus on Asian America, I thought about how to highlight
Obamacare in one of its subgroups. I share how I found a grassroots org with workers walking
door-to-door in Little Bangladesh, wedged into parts of Koreatown in downtown LA, hanging
out with them to illustrate how people share the healthcare message on the streets.

- If you're working general assignments or breaking news, crisis involving communities of color
pop up regularly. How do you find sources fast? How can we better tell compelling stories while
avoiding misinformation, misrepresentation or creating confusion ourselves?
Tip: It's not just about finding community leaders or leading activists. Who are the real people
supporting these people? They may avoid the limelight but truly grasp what's going on. More
often, they may carry out detailed tasks but feel they aren't photogenic enough for the cameras,

or their English isn't strong enough for interviews. When you react with empathy, patience
and cultivate the art of listening with these rare sources, it will reward you.
Anecdote: I walked in the office the day after Martin Luther King Day this past January. During
the holiday weekend, a college graduate had been brutally beaten to death outside a nightclub in
Santa Ana in Southern California - it would become the state's highest-profile murder this year, a
case getting not only national attention but global attention. "We need to find out more about the
victim," my editor said. "We need to give a sense of what kind of person she was." I spent the
rest of that day piecing together her profile.

care, offering TLC to a patient who never opened her eyes: http://www.latimes.com/local/la-meff-kim-pham-hospital-20140324-m-story.html#page=1
Tip: A note about the art of listening: I deal much of the time with immigrants or children of
immigrants. A significant portion of them do not come into contact with media. My style is to be
gentle yet firm. Devote a lot of time to background talk yet be clear about what you want to leave
an interview knowing.
-Let's take a quick look at some cultural stories and brainstorm how you can find simple or
quirky happenings where you live and work to write about, all the while illuminating diverse
