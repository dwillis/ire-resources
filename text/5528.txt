DATA &
DOCUMENTS
Video makes your story compelling….data makes it irrefutable

Are we enforcing the laws we have?

FEEL GOOD
GUN LAWS

MAKE A
STORY
YOURS
USING
LOCAL
DATA

USE DATA TO
FACT CHECK
YOURSELF
Correcting yourself or the rest of the media isn’t easy—but worth it!

FOLLOW THE
MONEY

It all started with an overpriced epipen…

DON’T TAKE
WHAT THEY

A hard lesson in believing PIO’s

Deep
thoughts on
data

• Submit requests daily
• Keep a list of what you’ve requested
• Update those data bases—look for trends
• Know what is available online—may not have to pay for
data, could be readily available
• Look for data in the RAW
• Interview your data, look for more than what you set
out to find
• Answer your own questions
• Show your work! Programs like Tableau *free to IRE
members make that possible
• Find the story in the data—data in and of itself may not
make a great story (no more showing you looking at a
spreadsheet on TV)

FINALLY, IF
YOU CAN’T
BEAT ‘EM..
You know the cliché. Don’t forget to have fun!
