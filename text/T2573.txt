Political Nonprofits
Hidden money, hidden agendas

On Tap: Political Nonprofits
• I will cover:
– What types of groups are out there.
– What public documents they file.
– What these groups are up to.
– What the future looks like.
– Why 527s are worth paying attention to.
– What Congress is considering doing about 527s.
– Where to find more information.

Glossary of Terms
– BCRA: The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002,
aka. McCain/Feingold(Shays/Meehan).
– Electioneering Activity: Has a specific meaning (30/60
window), but also a general meaning (activity related
to elections).
– Express Advocacy: Vote for/Elect/Defeat, etc.
– Issue Advocacy: Generic ads that support or oppose
a candidate or issue. Used to be paid for largely with
soft money, now almost exclusively nonprofit.
– Soft money: Very specific meaning. Not the same as
nonfederal or state/local funds.

Political Nonprofits
• What is a political nonprofit?
– All nonprofits can engage in some level of what might
be called political activity.
– 501(c)3 – Charitable organizations. Anything from
NPR to IRE to CPI.
– 501(c)4 – Lobbying, policy, educational organizations.
Sierra Club, United Seniors.
– 501(c)5 – Union organizations.
– 501(c)6 – Business leagues, Chambers.
– And the newcomers… Section 527 Orgs

Nonprofits: The New Black
– Although nonprofits in general are nothing new when
it comes to politics, they are all the rage these days.
– More attention is being paid to political nonprofits for
several reasons..
• In the traditional nonprofit realm, 501-type organizations,
there *appears* to be more activity.
• 527s, the new kind of political nonprofit, are considered by
some to be the biggest gap in the campaign finance
laws…NOT loophole….gap.
• 527s raised and spent more than $600 million in 2004, and
may have had a decisive impact on the presidential race.
• Congress is considering two “reforms” that many folks think
will drive money from 527s to other forms of nonprofits.

Political Nonprofits
• As political nonprofits get more popular, our jobs get
harder.
– Money is harder than ever to track.
– Organizations like to have a lot of different wallets: The Sierra
Club will have a 501c3, 501c4, a federal PAC and a 527
organization.
– May have connected state affiliates for downballot races.
– It enters the political arena from nontraditional sources.
– It is more fungible than ever. No such thing as a purely state or
federal election.
– Reporters have to be used to knowing the difference between a
501(c)4, 501(c)5, 501(c)6 and 527 committee.

(i.e., electronic filing)

Primary public document: Form 990, 8871, 8872

501c Committees
• Advantages of 501c committees
– Money is undisclosed largely
– Disclosure is delayed, not timely
– Individual donors remain anonymous
– Few restrictions on how money

• Disadvantages of 501c committees
– Political activity cannot be the “primary purpose” of the organization.
– Must have an IRS-approved “exempt purpose” other than politics.
– Tax implications for large donors, gift tax
– IRS will (and has) audited, fined and stripped tax status of 501s that abuse
the system.

501c Committees
• Types of groups:
– Front groups: Both corporations and unions routinely use 501c’s
as fronts, claiming to have millions of members. United Seniors
(Pharma), American Family Values (union), Americans for Job
Security.
– Membership groups: National Rifle Association, AFL-CIO,
Business Roundtable, US Chamber of Commerce.
– Issue groups: MoveOn.org, Club for Growth, Progress for America.
– Mobilization groups: Project Vote, 501c3 affiliated and funded by
unions and left-leaning interests.
– Religious organizations: Churches
– Research groups: The Reform Institute, Center for Public
Integrity…

501c Committees
• Types of activities:
– Voter registration and mobilization.
– Issue advertisements.
– Direct mail and phone banking.
– Fundraising for other political organizations.
– “Grassroots” lobbying.
– Direct lobbying.
– Research.
… in short, they can do a lot.

501c Committees
• Dollars and cents
– How much do they spend on elections? No one knows.
– Public Citizen compiled a database of 450 political ads paid for by
501s to affect 136 elections between 2000-2004. This is the tip of
the iceberg.
– At least $87 million spent by 26 of the committees they tracked to
influence 117 races in 2000 and 2002 (Broadcast only).
– GOP-leaning groups outspent democrat-leaning 501s by 66/33
percent.
– Pharma is the biggest apparent donor to 501 political groups, at
more than $40 million in 2002.
– Public Citizen claims 10 of the 30 groups in the study engaged
exclusively or largely in election activities, in apparent violation of
their tax status.

The Future of 501s

• Bottom line:
– If Congress largely reigns in 527s on the federal
level, there could be a massive influx of money
into the 501 realm.
– Expect more Democratic-leaning groups,
depending on what Congress does in terms of
regulating 527s.

527 Committees
• What are they?
– Poorly named for one… but it’s what we’ve got.
– Easier to describe what they are not than what they
are: neither federal nor state nor 501c. Product of a
loophole in the law, but are not themselves a
loophole.
– Difference in the way the IRS and FEC defined a
political committee.
– Have been with us for at least a decade, but just
now are coming to light because of disclosure.

527 Committees
• What are they?
– They have only a few limits on where they can
spend money on (no express advocacy, no
electioneering during 30/60 day window)
– Virtually no limits on funding sources
– Absolutely no limits on contribution amounts
– Disclosure required, but barely policed
– Limited public documents

527 Committees
• Who has to file?
– Any political entity engaged in politically related activity
NOT required to file with their state or the FEC must file
with the IRS.
– This is tax law, and thus will trump any state loopholes.
– These groups do not have to be formal, incorporated. A
bank account can be considered a 527.
– 527s that raise or spend more than $50,000 must file
electronically. Smaller organizations can file on paper.

527 Committees
• Disclosure, the good news
– These groups disclose through the IRS,
which just revamped its website.
– The new site (eforms.irs.gov) allows for
better searching and is much easier to use.
– That data is available for download and is
fairly easy to use.

527 Committees

527 Committees
• Disclosure, the bad news
– The IRS does not filter or edit in any way.
There are more than 23,000 groups registered.
– We went through all 23,000 and found just over
600 to date that are “true” 527s.
– There is a “true” 527 flag, but lots of groups fail
to fill out their registration correctly.
– The data is dirty; the IRS does not vett, clean or
code in any way.

527 Committees
• Disclosure, the bad news…cont.
– We’re not sure yet whether the IRS is
using a true “record number” like the FEC.
– That means, even if you do get the data
you want, you could be double counting
money because it’s quite difficult to know if
a filing has been amended.
– It still takes forever for the IRS to post
filings.
– The website is better, but still annoying
(sessions, timeouts, etc).

The Future of 527s
• Bottom line:
– 527s are not going away, although they may shift
their role in the future toward more more generic
activities.
– Voter turnout and mobilization, the ACT model.
– Membership groups like MoveOn or Club for
Growth will likely remain active.
– More focus on state elections and issues like
school vouchers.
– Congress considering regulations to reign in the
blatantly federal 527s.

527s in the States
The next frontier for 527s is in state elections.
Chamber of Commerce, Spitzer backlash.
21st Century Democrats fined $300K by Minnesota.
“And for the Sake of the Kids”…or corporations?
Politician administrative accounts… slush funds.
They do activity related to elections, but not directly
election related… for example the Alaska to America
Energy Initiative.

527s do the darndest things

527s do the darndest things
One donor…a lobbyist…

One recipient…the governor’s policy director…

527 Reforms
• Congress considering competing legislation.
– Senate bill (McCain/Feingold) would force 527s to
file as federally regulated PACs if they spend
money on federal election activity.
– Would change the allocation ratios, forcing groups
like ACT to spend more regulated hard money on
generic activities.
– House bill (Pence/Wynn) would not add any
additional regulations to 527s.
– It would loosen aggregate contribution limits for
political parties, allowing individuals to give
millions to the parties.

527 Reforms

same for reporters trying to cover political
nonprofits:
