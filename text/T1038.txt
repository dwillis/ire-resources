Three Traditions of GovernmentCitizen interaction /by I. Tallo/

Lessons Learned
• There are always some things that are kept

secret

secrets laws

of information

to teach us in terms of freedom of information

influence, economically viable media companies

Reality of 2001 – Challenges

journalism that leads to reduced motivation
among journalists
• Insufficient self-regulation structures to provide
forum for discussion on professional journalistic
issues
• Lack of journalistic skills about internet search,
collecting and analyzing data
• No government defined policy regarding access
to electronic information
6

Reality of 2001 – Challenges
• Ongoing mergers and change of ownership in

media companies
• Financially viable media does not mean more
investments in journalism
• Media alliances to business and political
groupings
• IT in newsrooms - for profit making and better
outlook rather than better journalism
• Opinion pools show decline in public trust in
media independence

Solution - Creating Pressure
• Internal pressure

– Growing pressure from democratic society where
investigative journalism is an essential part
– New generation of journalists with desire, education
and ability to apply new research methods;
– New generation of media managers not directly
aligned to existing elite

• External pressure

– Latvia’s integration in the EU requires public access to
information and transparency;
– International cooperation through professional
education and transfer of modern investigation
methods
