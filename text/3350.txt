How do we calculate estimates?
• Census Year = Survey Data
• After the census year
year, forecasts are required
– Further out past census
census-- the more out of date census data are
– Alternative sources are needed

• USPS carrier data - updated monthly, represent all mailmail-able
addresses in the US
– Does not come at standard levels of geography
– Data must be conflated – moved from one type of geography to
another
– This can cause severe accuracy problems if not done properly
