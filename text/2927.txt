IRE National Conference – June 8,
2007
Richard Robertson, Adam Dawson
and Larry Lopez

It Depends
• Types of PIs and What They Do
• Finding and investigating subjects.

Who PIs Are
• Firms Vary
• What They Do Well Also Varies
– The IGI/Kroll Model
– The Pinkerton/Garda Model
– The Boutique
– The Moms and Pops

Plus and Minus
• Reporters
– Can speak to anyone at any time
– Must always tell truth
– Limited budgets and time

• PIs
– Client determines who to contact and how
– Can lie under some circumstance
– Larger budgets (usually)
– Our clients are scared of you

Working With A PI
• Tradeoffs are possible
– Tasini as a bargaining chip

• Enforce YOUR ethical rules
• Cheaper alternatives: IRE, AIIP, prospect
researchers, CI, etc.
• For expensive databases, partner with other
papers, broadcasters etc.

What PIs Do

How They Do It
• It Depends On The Circumstances, But …
– Identifying assets
– Identifying and locating “subjects”
– Backgrounding them
– Interviewing them
– Watching them
– Understanding the Process
– Document trails

Investigative Tripod
• Litigation and regulation
• Recorded documents
• Words (newspapers, speeches, internet et al)

Resources For Tight Budgets
• Newspapers
– Newslib
– Public and County Law Libraries
– Google News Archive
• Free search, ~$3 per story, but many steps

– nlnewsbank.com and Obits.com
• Free search, and ~$3 but lousy search interface

– Factiva
• $70 sub, ~$3 per story, great searches & Hoovers.

For a few dollars more
• Dialog and Lexis Nexis a la carte (not all
their newspapers are included)
• Subscriptions to Lexis-Nexis or LN through
Tracers Information Services.
• Full-Text Sources Online

Courts on the Cheap
• Get PACER, the best bargain of all
• Use US BOP as a flawed backup
• Stanford Clearinghouse on Securities Class
Actions
• For states, use portals like brbpubs.com and
publicrecords.com but be leery of the forpay links.
• Use retrievers (but caveat emptor)

For a few dollars more
• Consider a trial run of portals like Legal
Dockets Online and searchsystems.net.
• Sign up free for Court Link, Superior
Online, Know-X, Court PC of CT, etc.
• Subscribe to the local Lawyer’s Weekly
• Lexis Nexis, Westlaw et al.
• BNA, CCH and similar outfits

General Regulatory Filings
– Use free portals like brbpub.com and
publicrecords.onlinesearches.com and
freeprf.com
– Google
--FOIA the agency for blank forms
--Call (and if you are investigating the agency,
call the former employees)
--Prospect Researcher sites (e.g. veritasinfo.com)

Business Filings on the cheap
Investor relations departments
• SEC and Self Regulatory Organizations
– BASIC, CRDs, IAPD

• States
– Blue Sky and Reg D

• 10K Wizard
• Public Library – D&Bs, CorpTech, etc.

For a few (hah!) $ more
• GSI Livedgar
– Great full-text searching for specialized cases
– No action letters

• 10K Wizard
• Bloomberg
• Hoovers
• Specialty Pubs
• SCAN-CCH, Lexis, Dialog et al

Beyond Databases
• Shortsellers
• Qui Tam
• Labor Lawyers and Unions
• Securities Class Actions
• Pension Funds
• (and of course vendors, rivals, exemployees, funders, unions, pension funds
…)

Criminal Defense
• Joint defense – until it isn’t
• What doesn’t make it to court
• Privilege issues
• Innocence Project

Due Diligence
– Investing other people’s money
– Hiring
– Retroactive due diligence
– Self and political due diligence

Litigation and Arbitration
• Assets
– Is it worth it to sue
– Now that we’ve won, how do we get the money
• Inheritance, divorce, businesses, hobbies, real
estate, litigation, tax filings, former colleagues

• Locate, background, and interview fact and
expert witnesses
– Frozen moments in time

Business Advantage
• Hostile Takeovers
• Hedge Funds and Short-Sellers
• Negotiations

Qui Tam and Labor
• Whistleblower cases, on the rise
• Qui Tam cases sealed, but lawyer can
discuss general facts if s/he chooses
• Small Qui Tam bar and often nervous about
press

Environmental and Mass Torts
• Monsanto Rules
• Sanborn Maps
• Cross-Directories, Mormons and the
Library of Congress

Locating Witnesses
• Phone books
• RMV
• Property records and landlords
• Web locators (free but weak)
• Social Networking
• Fee-based locators (see tipsheet)

Fee-based locators
• Based on credit headers and likely to have
former addresses
• Relatively cheap and good:
– Accurint (has PAW)
– Merlin
– quickinfo.net

• More expensive
– Choicepoint/DBT/Autotrack

Specialized tools
• Sometimes, a bad database can serve your
purpose. Out-of-data files can help find
people by maiden names.
• Even the best databases won’t always find
folks who are overseas or in nursing homes,
mental hospitals, the military and lock-ups.
• The military has its own locators, though,
and a lot of prisons are online.

Investigating witnesses in
general
• Need a combination of free web and feebased vendors
• Exact mix varies state to state.
• A full news search requires Lexis-Nexis,
Dialog and Factiva.
• A rule of thumb: one out of every ten
resumes does not check out.
• Leverage info: interview
colleagues/neighbors identified in search

Federal state and local regulators
• Professional licenses
• Excluded parties – Fed Ex
• Agency decisions
• Congressional testimony
