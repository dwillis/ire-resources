Digging deep with data
journalism
NICAR 2013

THE BRIGHT IDEA
Why is Ohio No. 1 in
foreclosures?
Where are the worst football
fans?
What’s wrong with FERPA?
Who has been wrongly
convicted?
Are youth sports out of
control?
Who is teaching our kids?

Where to find ideas
Jump off the news – bus drivers, public
suicides, OSU scandal
Look at long-standing problems – FERPA,
teachers, DNA
Tap your own curiosity – Domestic violence,
youth sports
Get a tip – foreclosure, sex trafficking, credit
reporting
Prove a point – Spoilsports
Steal an idea from IRE or NICAR – disabled
workers

Imprisoned and licensed to
teach

Child Rapist

Child Molester
