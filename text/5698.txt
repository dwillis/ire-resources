Radon testing in schools: KARE 11’s investigation exposed more than 80% of Minnesota
school districts were not complying with state and federal radon testing recommendations.
The CDC says radon is the 2nd leading cause of lung cancer, after smoking, and is responsible
for more than 20,000 deaths each year. The day after the investigation aired the Governor
promised executive action, and within a week, new legislation was introduced to make radon
testing in schools mandatory.

Tell a Story: Don’t give away the farm in the intro and opening lines. Save little nuggets to reveal
throughout the report to keep the viewers’ attention. Data is important and instructive, but richly reported
personal stories can be critical to engaging your audience. We shouldn’t just be investigators; we should
also be great storytellers.
“As investigative journalists we all concern ourselves with the public’s right to know. As storytellers, we should also
concern ourselves with the public’s right – not to know. – Until the perfect moment.” – A.J. Lagoe, who
paraphrased & stole it from Boyd Huppert, who says he stole it from John Larson.

Frame your investigation as a question: In today’s climate of allegations of bias or “fake news”
taking viewers along on your journey to get a question answered is a good way to be transparent and it
also helps keep your story focused.

‘Prime the Pump’: Don’t assume officials are always watching. Before we break major stories, we
alert key officials – and tell them we’ll want reaction. That generates follow-ups. And often results in
promises of government action which opens the door to further accountability if promises are not kept.
