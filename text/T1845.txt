“Cultivating Whistleblowers” Panel

Tip #1: Consider the Power & Reach of the Net
A. On your company’s Web site, if possible, post your email address and a paragraph
asking for information from whistleblowers on the topic at hand. Also, contact public
interest groups or others who are plugged into the issue, and ask them to post your
email address and paragraph on a listserv or on their Web site (which whistleblowers
might visit). Yes, you’ll get way too much e-mail, much of it with useless or unfounded
information, and yes, it’ll take a lot of work to weed through it all. But you may also
discover some gems.
Be as specific as possible in your paragraph so you’re contacted by the most relevant
sources. An example is:
“My name is Sharyl Attkisson. I’m a correspondent for CBS Evening News. I’m
investigating the Enron story and am looking for current or former employees who might
have information, documentation and/or proof of misspending from employee benefits
accounts. Please contact me if you have information, or if you know of someone who
might be able to help. Feel free to pass this along to others. If you email me, please
include all contact information you’re comfortable disclosing; it will be kept strictly
confidential. I’ll contact you if and when I need to follow up with you. Thank you.
sac@xyz.com.”
B. As obvious as it sounds, don’t forget to search the Web and Nexis under your topic
and “whistleblower” or “lawsuits”. You could find articles, Web sites and lawsuits with
valuable public information naming and/or leading you to other sources who may be
willing to blow the whistle—or at least confirm information you’ve obtained elsewhere.

Tip #2: Resources
A. The following groups are often contacted by whistleblowers and may be willing to put you
in touch with some. The group’s appearance on this list should not be considered an
endorsement on my part. Each, of course, has varying degrees of credibility and reliability;
it’s always up to you to check out all information and not rely solely on what the group may
tell you.

committees and see if the investigators will help you out.
C. Some attorneys specialize in a specialty area called qui tam. Qui Tam literally means
“he who sues for the king as well as himself.” It’s part of the Federal Civil False Claims Act
under which private citizens can sue in the name of the US government, charging fraud by
any entity which receives or uses government funds. Whistleblowers often sue under this
law.

Tip #3: A Few Words on “Disgruntled Employees”
As journalists, we always look first and foremost for sources to go on the record and
on camera. And many of us seem to think we should shun the proverbial
“disgruntled former employee.” But whistleblower stories may require you to
abandon some traditional notions.
For obvious reasons, whistleblowers may be loath to go on camera. They may fear
losing their job; retaliation directed at them or their families/friends; personal harm;
or they may not be the type who’s willing to be thrust into the spotlight.
Furthermore, some of the most valuable whistleblowers are, indeed, disgruntled.
Sometimes they became disgruntled by trying to draw attention to wrongdoing
within their company or agency; but getting rebuffed. Sometimes they’re disgruntled
because the company retaliated against them when they complained. Or the cause
could be unrelated—maybe they’re disgruntled because the company fought their
worker’s comp claim or passed them over for a promotion. Isn’t it true that most
anyone who’d be willing to blow the whistle on wrongdoing would, by definition, be
disgruntled in a sense? If they were entirely happy with everything about their job or
company, they certainly wouldn’t be complaining!
Continued on Next Page—

Tip #3: A Few Words on “Disgruntled Employees”—cont.
None of these obstacles necessarily means the whistleblower should be
disregarded, or that you can’t do the story. You simply must, as always, check the
person’s credibility and information thoroughly. You must discover their warts and
address them in your story, if necessary. If they won’t appear on camera, they
may lead you to someone who’s willing to. They may provide documents, emails,
internal memos or guidance that can help you do the story even without an on
camera interview.
Further in this tip sheet I’ve included examples of my stories for which some of the
main sources would not appear on camera.

Tip #4: Dealing With Whistleblowers
• Have a “No Surprises” Policy
As you gain the whistleblower’s trust, ask him to come clean with anything someone could
use to attack his credibility. Explain that any “surprises” exposed by his enemies after a
story runs, undermines his and the story’s credibility, and is counterproductive to the
goal of exposing wrongdoing. Whistleblowers have actually fessed up to me about drug use
and being accused of stealing on the job. One told me he’d been arrested in the past for
hitting his wife. In that case, I’m glad I knew because his boss did try to undermine him
by slipping me that tidbit “off-the-record”…but I already knew of it. In many cases, such
information wouldn’t need to be disclosed in the story; but it’s helpful to know as much as
reasonably possible.
• Make Him His Own Worst Critic
Ask the whistleblower to tell you the best arguments against what he’s claiming—and
who’s likely to make them. A whistleblower exposing fraudulent spending of taxpayer
dollars might tell you that his supervisor conducted a survey and found no fraud! You
need to know of this evidence against your whistleblower’s story, and if there’s a way to
counter it. For example, the survey might have been conducted by the very person
accused of the fraud in the first place, undermining its credibility.
• Get the Physical Goods
Get all the supporting documentary proof you can from your whistleblower: emails,
internal memos, photographs, security videotape, phone answering machine
recordings…ask about everything! For TV stories, ask him to let you videotape his job
reviews, nametag, uniform, identification or other visuals.
• Job reviews
Whistleblowers who reveal wrongdoing are often fired by former employers for being “bad
employees.” In my experience, whistleblowers often have the best proof to counter their
employer’s claims: glowing job reviews up until the moment they were fired! Always ask
the whistleblower for job reviews. They’re valuable if they’re stellar; if they’re not, they may
reveal weaknesses in the whistleblower’s credibility, which need to be addressed.

•

Avoid the Bamboozlement Factor

Don’t hesitate to address inconsistencies in your whistleblower’s story. Never hesitate to
abandon him—and the story—if you discover he’s not credible (even if you personally
believe the story is true). Look for better sources.

Tip #5: Examples
Six example scripts follow, showing varying uses of whistleblower types.
SCRIPT 1: Los Alamos Lab Scandal
•
•

Whistleblowers: Two employees who tried to “blow the whistle”
internally, then contacted FBI and outside authorities while still
working for the Lab.
Comment: While I was in the process of researching the piece, they
got fired; I immediately called them and got them on camera.
SCRIPTS 2, 3, 4: Red Cross Fraud

•
•

Whistleblowers: Dozens of high-ranking, credible sources currently
and formerly with the Red Cross.
Comments: They were willing to provide information and documents
but—across the board—they were terrified to be associated with the
story publicly. I’ve never before run across so many sources who were
afraid of retaliation and of the supposed power of an organization to
hurt them. Although they would not be interviewed on camera, I was
able to do this three-part series based on information they provided.
SCRIPT 5: Janet Rehnquist

•
•

Whistleblowers: numerous sources currently and formerly with the
HHS Inspector General’s office.
Comments: Again, they were universally afraid to go on camera, in
part because the woman they were criticizing is the daughter of the
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Still, I was able to use their
information and quotes to put together this report.
SCRIPT 6: Red Cross Bad Blood

•
•

Whistleblower: Mark Cox, who contacted a source from a previous
story of mine. Cox said he, too, had been fired after blowing the
whistle on dangerous blood practices.
Comment: When I tried to contact Cox, he wouldn’t return my calls. I
did a search in his state looking for lawsuits against the Red Cross
and found he’d filed suit. I contacted his lawyer, listed on the court
papers, and eventually convinced Cox to do an interview—which
resulted in this report.

Los Alamos Lab Scandal Nov. 2002 Sharyl Attkisson CBS Evening News
Investigators Glenn Walp and Steven Doran were hired by Los Alamos Weapons Lab earlier this year,
in part to make sure equipment and research that could help our enemies didn't just walk out the door.
They quickly uncovered stunning security lapses.
(SOT-GLENN WALP, FORMER LOS ALAMOS SECURITY SPECIALIST)
(11:19) IT WAS OBVIOUS AT THAT TIME WE WERE DEALING WITH MAJOR CRIMINAL
INVESTIGATION CONCERNING MAJOR THEFTS AT THE LAB. (:07)

They found millions of dollars in stolen and "missing" items: a forklift, hundreds of computers...some
from the top secret X Division...a cryogenic refrigerator, oscilloscopes...materials that in theory could be
used in a weapons program by rogue nations like Iraq and North Korea. They also found Lab workers
using government credit cards like personal blank checks.
(SOT-STEVEN DORAN, FORMER LOS ALAMOS SECURITY )
(01:25:30) WE FOUND LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF ITEMS THAT HAD BEEN PURCHASED THAT
WERE UNAUTHORIZED TYPE PURCHASES. (:08)
GLENN:(26:29) DIAMOND NECKLACE, DIAMOND EARRINGS, DIAMOND BRACELET... (:04)
STEVE: (25:38) ...REFRIGERATORS, VCRS, TELEVISION SETS... (:03)
The buys were traced to some of the Lab's most trusted employees. One worker, who had a milliondollar-a-month credit line, charged a custom Mustang vehicle to the taxpayers on her government credit
card.
(SOT-DORAN)
(05:51) IT WAS 20-THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE MUSTANG AND IT WAS ANOTHER 10THOUSAND DOLLARS IN CUSTOMIZED PARTS. (:07)
They began working with the FBI, and Agents recently searched the homes of two Lab workers
allegedly caught red-handed with spy-gear, lock picks, and keys to secret Lab locations. But the more
Walp and Doran uncovered, the more they say Lab managers tried to cover up...worried more about
keeping the security problems quiet.
(SOT-WALP)
(01:16:32) BOTH STEVE AND I WERE TOLD EMPHATICALLY THAT WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO
COMMUNICATE WITH THE FBI (:08)
(GRAPHIC #1)
The University of California, which runs Los Alamos, says it's "seen no evidence of any compromise to
national security" and it’s cooperating with outside probes into charges that senior management covered
up and interfered with investigations. (GRAPHIC OUT)
As for why the two investigators would be fired just as they began to scratch the surface...the Lab only
says--quote--they weren't a good fit.
(ATTKISSON LIVE CLOSE)
WALP AND DORAN SAY THERE'S NO TELLING HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE COMMITTED CRIMES
OR HOW LONG IT'S GONE ON...THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE WORKING TO FIND OUT. THE
ENERGY DEPARTMENT AND FBI CONTINUE INVESTIGATING, BUT NOW WITHOUT THE HELP OF
THE TWO INVESTIGATIVE INSIDERS WHO MAY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO UNCOVER THE MOST.

Red Cross Fraud Part One, July 2002, Sharyl Attkisson, CBS Evening News
The American Red Cross may be expert at responding to public disasters...

NAT/SOT
"THANK YOU"
...but for years it's failed to get a grip on financial disasters at its local chapters.
(GRAPHIC #1)
*There's the fundraiser in Louisiana caught padding her own bank account with donations...
*the manager in Pennsylvania who embezzled to support her crack cocaine habit...
*and the executive in Maryland who forged signatures on purchase orders meant for disaster victims, to
name a few. (GRAPHIC OUT)
But the biggest criminal scandal inside the Red Cross surfaced in New Jersey last year. And though it's
been kept off the front pages, it ranks among the biggest charity frauds ever.
The accused: the chief executive of the Hudson County Chapter, Joseph Lecowitch, and his bookkeeper
Catalina Escoto.
(SOT-MICHAEL D'ANDREA, PROSECUTOR/courtesy 60 Minutes)
(01:11:49) THE BOOKKEEPING METHODS OF MR. LECOWITCH AND MS. ESCOTO LEAVE A LOT
TO BE DESIRED. (:05)
(FONT: 60 MINUTES)
Escoto allegedly gave herself at least 75-thousand dollars in "bonuses". All told, prosecutors say the duo
stole well over a MILLION dollars in Red Cross funds...squandering it on gambling and each other.
Escoto plead not guilty...Lecowitch died after he was indicted.
(ATTKISSON BRIDGE)
The New Jersey fiasco happened right under the nose of Red Cross headquarters. Critics say the
reason the Red Cross has so little control over its chapters is that the CHAPTERS are pulling the
strings: they collect most of the donations, dominate the national board, and resist tighter controls by
headquarters.
Dr. Bernadine Healy had been president of the charity a year. Said to be stunned by what she saw as a
cavalier attitude about New Jersey...
(GRAPHIC #2)
...she wrote this scathing confidential memo to the Red Cross audit committee:
"Many of the controls presumed by you...to be in place are not there." She called reviews by external
auditor KPMG "inadequate" because chapters often don't give details of their finances to headquarters.
And in the most telling statement of all -- "We cannot assure the accuracy of... {financial statements}
provided to the IRS...This appears to be a major business and legal risk and would impact many of
KPMG's certifications." (GRAPHIC OUT)
KPMG wouldn't comment. But the Red Cross now says the criticism from its then President was way off
the mark.
(SOT-JACK CAMPBELL, RED CROSS CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER)
(09:22)(SHARYL) DO YOU FEEL YOU'RE COMPLETELY SATISFIED WITH THE FINANCIAL
ACCOUNTABILITY OF CHAPTERS OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS ? (CAMPBELL) I THINK WE
HAVE AN EXTREMELY SOLID SYSTEM OF ACCOUNTABILITY FOR OUR CHAPTERS, BOTH IN
TERMS OF FINANCIAL REPORTING, INTERNAL AUDITS AND LOCAL GUIDANCE AND
GOVERNANCE."
Continued on Next Page—

Continued from Previous Page—
Dr. Healy, clearly the odd man out in wanting stronger chapter accountability, left the Red Cross last
fall. A CBS News contributor, she wouldn't be interviewed for this report. But not long after she raised
questions about what the chapters were doing, her grave concerns were confirmed...surprisingly by
the Red Cross' own auditors..
(GRAPHIC #3)
...in this report obtained by CBS News. Among the "trends" at local chapters:
"Payroll..inappropriate or incorrect"
"Financial reports...are not prepared...or are not accurate"
"Blank checks are accessible..."
"National disaster contributions are not remitted to national headquarters..."
(GRAPHIC OUT)
(ATTKISSON CLOSE)
Weeks later, the terrorists struck...and the Red Cross rushed special investigative auditors to see what
the chapters were doing with the millions in donations pouring in. What they found...in tomorrow's
report. In Washington, I'm Sharyl Attkisson for Eye on America.

Red Cross Fraud, July 2002, Sharyl Attkisson, CBS Evening News
NAT/SND
In the hours after the 9-11 attack...a record breaking amount of donations started pouring into more
than a thousand local Red Cross chapters.

NAT/SOT
"YOU CAN ENTER WORLD TRADE CENTER DISASTER"
What donors didn't know was that some of the chapters entrusted with all that money had been
identified by Red Cross headquarters just a few weeks before...
(GRAPHIC #1)
...for having poor accounting procedures, inaccurate financial reports and KEEPING national disaster
contributions that SHOULD'VE been sent to headquarters in Washington. That according to internal
documents obtained by CBS news. (GRAPHIC OUT)
The Red Cross isn't known for keeping a tight reign on its chapters. But now, it was suddenly crucial
for headquarters to find out what chapters were doing with the millions in 9-eleven donations. So the
Red Cross leadership rushed special investigative auditors out to conduct surprise inspections. The
results were startling.
(GRAPHIC #2)
According to documents obtained by CBS News, a dozen of the Red Cross chapters audited were
marking -- or "coding" -- donations as LOCAL funds...meaning chapters like San Diego, Southwest
Florida, and Gateway Area, Iowa would KEEP the money instead of sending it in for nine-eleven
victims. (GRAPHIC OUT)
(GRAPHIC #3)
What's more, the Savannah chapter "could not provide information regarding cash (and) checks
collected", in Pine Tree, Maine "cash (and) checks (were) unlocked at all times" and Los Angeles had
"no accurate accounting for funds received after 9/11" believed then to total "at least a half million
dollars." (GRAPHIC OUT)
Continued on Next Page—

Continued from Previous Page—

NAT/SOT
"HERE'S A SOLICITATION FROM THE RED CROSS"
The fact that the San Diego chapter was coding donations as LOCAL was no surprise to county
supervisor Diane Jacobs who'd been fighting the chapter for a year over lack of accountability for fire
donations and issuing a doctored audit.
(SOT-DIANE JACOBS)
(03:06:25) THE LOCAL CHAPTERS ARE OPERATING INDEPENDENTLY. THEY'RE ON THEIR OWN,
THERE'S LACK OF OVERSIGHT, THERE'S LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY"
(ATTKISSON BRIDGE)
Sources tell CBS News the national Red Cross singled out the chapters for surprise audits --nearly thirty
of them-- because of their recent financial problems from sloppy acounting to worse...they were even
nicknamed by some INSIDE as the "Dirty Thirty." But when the charity recently answered questions from
Congress, it made it seem like there were no problems.
(SOT-JACK CAMPBELL, no font)
(SHARYL) WEREN'T YOU TROUBLED BY THE RESULTS OF THE AUDIT (CAMPBELL) ACTUALLY
WE WERE NOT TROUBLED BY THE RESULTS OF THE AUDIT AT ALL."
The Red Cross DEFENDED the chapters, saying they had discretion to keep the money because
headquarters hadn't yet issued guidance. Also, they might have thought the money was in response to
other local fundraising efforts.
(SOT-JACK CAMPBELL, RED CROSS CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER)
(17:04:59) (SHARYL) SO SOME OF THE CHAPTERS YOU THINK LEGITIMATELY THOUGHT
MAYBE THIS MONEY ISN'T FOR SEPTEMBER 11 EVEN THOUGH IT WAS ROLLING IN ON
SEPTEMBER 12TH (CAMPBELL) SOME OF IT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN FOR SEPTEMBER 11TH."
He says after the audits, the Red Cross DID require chapters to send in ALL the money they got after
September eleventh, so he claims no harm was done.
(GRAPHIC #4)
The Red Cross also says it imposed a "rigorous set of additional procedures....and more national
oversight" of chapters after that. (GRAPHIC OUT)
Daniel Borochoff heads a charity watchdog group and says it just shows that the Red Cross should be
subject to STATE oversight just like other charities...but the Red Cross bucks that idea saying
FEDERAL oversight already in place is enough.
(SOT-DANIEL BOROCHOFF, PRESIDENT AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF PHILANTHROPY)
(11:08:19) IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR THEM TO NOT WANT TO BE ACCOUNTABLE TO
THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERALS AND ALSO TO THEIR OWN NATIONAL OFFICE. (:08)

Red Cross Bad Blood, Aug, 2002, Sharyl Attkisson, CBS Evening News

Joe Szaller was a respected blood mobile medical team manager at the Red Cross Chesapeake
regional blood center in Baltimore...
(no font)
(13:39:19) (SHARYL) SO YOUR TEAM WAS BASICALLY THE SAFEST, BEST PERFORMING
BLOOD COLLECTION TEAM? (SZALLER) IN THE REGION! (:06)
But in late 2000, Szaller says he began seeing distrubing trends that HE felt compromised the safety
of the blood he helped collect...and the people who would receive it.
(no font)
(29:21) (SHARYL) DO YOU THINK POSSIBLY INFECTED BLOOD COULD HAVE SLIPPED
THROUGH? (SZALLER) YES, I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT. (:08)
How could that happen....
(GRAPHIC #1)
To begin with, handheld computers are SUPPOSED to "pre-check" donors against a database, in
case they've been flagged as unsafe. But Szaller says the "pre-check" computers were out-ofcommission most days.(GRAPHIC OUT)
(SOT-JOE SZALLER, FORMER RED CROSS BLOODMOBILE TEAM MANAGER)
(13:45:27) LET'S SAY YOU DO HAVE HEPATITIS C. WELL YOU CAN'T DONATE. WELL YOUR
SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER WOULD BE IN THAT PRE-SYSTEM AND IT WOULD COME UP AND
SAY 'MAY NOT DONATE.' IF I DON'T HAVE THE PRE-CHECK SYSTEM I DON'T KNOW THAT.
(:11)
(GRAPHIC #2)
According to Szaller, blood was routinely accepted without the required pre-check. Adding to the
dangers, he also says Red Cross employees were put on bloodmobiles without the mandatory safety
training...and weren't asking donors the right screening questions, questions to identify if they're at
high risk. (GRAPHIC OUT)
Szaller says he complained to his supervisors for months, but nothing changed.
(SOT-SZALLER)
(13:31:29) I REACHED THE POINT WHERE I COULD NOT SLEEP AT NIGHT. I WAS THANKFUL
AT THIS POINT THAT MY FAMILY LIVED IN WEST VIRGINIA IF THEY NEEDED A BLOOD
TRANSFUSION BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THE CHESAPEAKE BAY AREA'S THEY'RE TAKING
TOO MANY SHORTCUTS JUST TO MAKE THEIR GOALS. (:13)
Though much blood stays in the region where it's collected, it CAN be sent anywhere it's needed.
Finally, last year Szaller called a special Red Cross national hotline to report the safety violations.
After that, things DID change...but not the way he expected. He was fired.
Continued on Next Page—

Continued from Previous Page—

(SOT-JOE SZALLER)
(SHARYL) (36:28) THIS WAS A DAY AFTER YOU CALLED THE HOTLINE TO REPORT THE
PROBLEMS. (SZALLER) THE VERY NEXT DAY. (SHARYL) DID YOU SUSPECT THAT WAS WHY?
(SZALLER) YES. I KNEW IT. IN MY HEART ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF MY FEET
I KNEW THAT THIS WAS IT. (:12)
His bosses say they fired Szaller for mismanagement...even though they'd given him stellar job
reviews and stacks of commendations and awards.
(SOT-SZALLER)
(54:50) I'M PROUD OF THESE. I REALLY AM
What adds to Szaller's credibility is what the FDA found when it recently inspected the facility where
he worked.
(GRAPHIC #3)
In documents obtained by CBS News, inspectors cite a long list of safety violations...many of the
same ones Szaller had complained about. The FDA also found the systems designed to CATCH and
correct safety mistakes...were deeply flawed. (GRAPHIC OUT)
(ATTKISSON BRIDGE)
And those are the same problems the FDA's been documenting system-wide since 1985. In fact, the
FDA says the entire Red Cross blood system is in shambles and there's been a "dramatic INCREASE
in the number of unsuitable blood products it's released over the years."
(GRAPHIC #4)
The Red Cross argues it's poured millions of dollars into fixing and upgrading its blood business and
that the blood supply is now safer than ever. (GRAPHIC OUT)
Joe Szaller lost a court fight to get back his job...it turns out Maryland law doesn't protect all
whistleblowers. Though he no longer works for the Red Cross, Szaller feels by speaking out...he can
still play a role in saving lives.
(SOT-SZALLER)
(41:35) I'M NOT VINDICTIVE. I DON'T WANT ANY MONEY. I MEAN I WANT THIS TO BE OUT IN
THE PUBLIC IT'S GOT TO SAVE A LIFE, EVEN IF IT'S MY OWN SON'S. AND THAT'S THE
BOTTOM LINE. (:11)

Mark Cox helped run blood drives for the Boise, Idaho Red Cross when he says he discovered a
dangerous practice known as "overbleeds"-- too much blood taken from donors. It can make them sick
and put those RECEIVING the blood at risk for deadly clots.
(GRAPHIC #1)
Cox, a respected blood collector who's even cited in a published study...
(GRAPHIC OUT)
...thought the overbleeds were accidental and notified his supervisors.
(SOT-MARK COX- Former Red Cross Blood Mobile Team Leader)
(14:25:28) (S) WHAT KIND OF RESPONSES WERE YOU GETTING AS YOU STARTED
COMPLAINING? (COX) MY FIRST COMPLAINT WAS VERBAL AND I GOT NO RESPONSE FOR
MONTHS.
Continued from Previous Page—

Continued from Previous Page—
(ATTKISSON BRIDGE)
Believing the public's health was at risk, Cox called a special National Red Cross hotline. The Red
Cross started the hotline two years ago, hoping to help restore confidence in its handling of the
nation's blood supply. The FDA has been suing the Red Cross for years for violating blood safety
rules.
(GRAPHIC #2)
The hotline--the Red Cross promised--would "add an extra layer of safety". Communications would be
"strictly confidential".
(GRAPHIC OUT)
(SOT-COX)
(32:10) I THOUGHT ONCE NATIONAL FOUND OUT EVERYTHING WOULD COME TO A
SCREECHING HALT, THE BLOOD BAGS WOULD BE TURNED DOWN, MY BOSSES WOULD BE
TOLD THEY CAN'T DRAW THAT MUCH BLOOD. (Sharyl) WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? (MARK) I
WAS TERMINATED.
...the same day he made the call, his Boise bosses fired him for being "unprofessional."
(SOT-COX)
(14:42:30) (Sharyl) BEFORE THE HOTLINE CALL, DID YOU GET A BAD JOB REVIEW? (MARK)
NO I GOT AN EXCELLENT JOB REVIEW. AND A BIG RAISE."
CBS News reported earlier on another Red Cross blood worker, Joseph Szaller, who also alerted the
Red Cross hotline to serious blood safety violations...and got fired.
(GRAPHIC #3)
The National Red Cross says it's pure coincidence both men were fired right after they called the
hotline. The charity now says Cox was let go to protect co-workers who were frightened by his alleged
threats to "bring down the Red Cross". (GRAPHIC OUT)
(GRAPHIC #4)
Yet his unemployment claim states the Red Cross supplied "no evidence to support their reasoning for
terminating" him. (GRAPHIC OUT)
Cox is now suing the Red Cross, saying he never dreamed he'd lose his job for following his
conscience...
And he questions a system where workers who are trying to protect the public...end up getting
punished instead. Sharyl Attkisson CBS News Washington
