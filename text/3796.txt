TIMELINES

After filing a FOIA for the
travel receipts, we received
about 300 random pages in
no particular order for things
that didn’t make sense.
Rental cars but no flights.
Multiple flights to the same
place on the same date but
no hotel. It was a mess.

We saw interesting tidbits
like seat numbers indicating
the UDC President flew first
& business-class

Rental car
receipts
showing a
pattern of
“upgrades”
& “car
seats”

Credit card
receipts
showed UDC
paid for his
wife and child
to travel on
high-priced
flights

By comparing tiny print on
different documents, we
noticed flights booked just
days before, first-class
trips submitted as “coach”
and trips “pre-approved”
long after travel was
completed

There was so much
information, we started
imputting each date into a
timeline program

We typed in every receipt into an internet timeline…
http://www.dipity.com/tishathompson/UDC-President-Sessoms-Travel/#timeline

The timeline
helped us see
patterns…

We used
photos…

links…

and created pdf
documents out of
the paper
receipts.

TIMELINES
 The timeline showed the extravagance and the messy record
keeping at the same time
 Gov’t officials and other reporters used it for reference
throughout hearings
 We kept going back to it during live shots to refute
statements made by the president
 UDC VIDEO EXAMPLES
