How to break the story

Takeaways

Compare and contrast
●
How does your state/entity compares to others? Is there a sexual harassment
policy? When was the last time it was updated?
●
Is there mandatory sexual harassment training? Is it done online or in person?
Persistence
●
Does agency say that record doesn’t exist? Appeal. Check again. Ask how they
searched and which offices. Then ask again.

Investigating decades-old claims
● In absence of absolute proof of allegations, you can still rely on
documents and interviews to test credibility. Did the person live where
they said they did at the time? Does their timeline make sense? Do they
know details of the alleged abuser’s life? Are there police or other
records linking them to a related address or name?
● When tracing connections, don’t overlook microfiche newspaper libraries,
including family obituaries. They’ll list extended relatives, and often
where they lived at the time.

Takeaways

Focus on task ahead
Find a mentor
Don’t look too far into the future and don’t root for an outcome.
Don’t worry about the potential fallout from your work - concentrate on what
you can control: your story
