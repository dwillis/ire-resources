VISUAL STORYTELLING

The visual storytelling process should start at the very beginning of your project.
Here are a few things to keep in mind:
Ø Think visually from the moment you begin to research an investigative story.
Ø Take viewers inside the process of how you did your investigation.
Ø Stand-Ups – Make it more than just the reporters face! Show methodology; use it as a
means to tell an element of the story.
Ø Work as a team with your photographers and editors. They can give you valuable input
on how to tell the story.
Ø Identify your strongest pieces of tape and space them throughout the story, to keep the
viewer riveted.

The Visual Process:
Development – Plan ahead… What kind of B-roll do you need? Where’s the best location to
shoot the standup? What interview settings work best?

Writing – Write to your pictures. Find the moments that stand out and use them throughout
the piece. If you don’t have what you need, and have the time, go get it.

Pre-Production – Where you don’t have video to tell the story think about using graphics.
Can you use animation? The idea is to try and find the best way to illustrate the story without
letting the graphics become the story (don’t let them get in the way!).

Editing – Get the editor involved! Together, you want to come up with a style that adapts itself
to the subject matter. Think about the pacing and transitions you want to use in the piece. Make
the B-roll more than just cover video. Using well-composed shots and layering will tell the story
without words. The idea is to develop a look for the story and keep it throughout.

Post – Now that the piece is done, show it to others in the newsroom. What do they think?
What’s clear? What’s not clear? Many times someone who is not involved in the story can offer
some suggestions that will make the piece better.
