Quick data for quick turns…
or how to actually do data on
the job – fast
Data beat reporters should get, maintain
and update to jump on the news, or off it

Dave (me) – Quick turn data and stories
Greta – Careful now! Potential pitfalls
Francisco – Doing the quick turn
Nicole – From data to visuals

The big misconception:
it’s for major projects
Months of work
But my editor wants it NOW

Approaching a quick turn
In hours?
By end of the day?
Week?
Month?
Longer than a month?
Or… maybe continuously and periodically turned around
fast?

A few main points on thinking about how quickly you
can reasonably execute a data analysis
•Quick turn
• Relative to your workload
• Relative to your resources
• Can come in many forms
• Original data collection – surveys/polls your news organization conducts;
aggregating from similar agencies
• Analyzing public data in one clearinghouse – NCES, for example
• Analyzing “cleaned” data of others – think tanks/universities
• Fact-checking data pushed out in studies/political rhetoric
(on some beats, data can also be the text of policies rounded up and analyzed,
not just purely numbers)

Aggregating info to get the story no one’s doing

Analyzing what’s out there

Fact-checking
what crosses
your desk

Quick turnarounds snagged by details

Work toward building databases you can easily
maintain/churn more stories from often

As you get used to some quick turns and
strategize what is feasible, your efficiency
will likely only improve. Be kind to yourself in
the process.
Pitfalls happen. One character can be like a
nail in your tire. But a blowout now and then
is part of the learning journey.

Just because it’s quick...
… doesn’t mean it’s easy

Dirty data

Creative spelling

Lots of names for breeds

Talk to people!
