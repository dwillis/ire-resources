• FINDINGS: Thousands of medical
professionals have billed
Medicare at progressively higher
rates over a decade’s time,
costing taxpayers at least $11
billion in inflated charges.
• A significant portion of the added
charges is likely due to
“upcoding” — charging for more
extensive and costly services than
actually delivered.
• Upcoding is facilitated by abuse
of Medicare billing codes that
reflect the range of care
delivered and the time it takes.
Many doctors have steadily billed
the higher-level — and more
lucrative — codes, while spurning
those that pay less.

breakdown rate that remains
far worse than in most of the

relief to illegal immigrants. Out
of a backlog of 42,875 cases,
only 583 have been closed due
to prosecutorial discretion- a
rate of about 1.4 percent, less
than half the rate of cases that

a pattern of both unusually
high and unusually low scores
similar to Atlanta. For these
school systems, the odds of so
many suspicious score changes
occurring in a single district
due to chance alone were
extraordinarily low — ranging
from 1 in 1,000 to worse than
1 in 1 trillion

written at a 17.8 grade level and
the Declaration of Independence at

newspapers are written at between
an 11th and 14th grade level
• All these analyses use the FleschKincaid test, which produces the

terminology that is likely familiar to
many readers. At its core, FleschKincaid equates higher grade
levels with longer words and longer
sentences.
