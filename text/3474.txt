“Emotion is not the enemy of learning. There is little learning without it.”

“We pack our stories too much. It’s just too dense. We have to do better – not dumbing it down
– but making it more clear and more simple.”
-Kellie Cheadle, Producer, KING 5, Seattle
“Don’t get caught in process. Viewers don’t care you’ve spent seven months gathering data.
Find the characters that make people care. “
-Bob Segall, Reporter, WTHR, Indianapolis
“Precision reporting uses math, but you need not – as your math teacher said – ‘show your
work.’”
-Stuart Watson, Reporter, WCNC, Charlotte
“There were nuances to the voices – sort of a ‘wink and nod’ – so compelling to hear. I don’t
know if you can get that in print.”
