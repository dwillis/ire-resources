Can you write an abstract of what your book is about? In 100 words? 50? 25?
Would you pay $25 and devote three nights to reading your investigation?
Why? Would you if you lived half way across the country?
What makes your investigation a book and not an article(s)?
Is there a narrative? Can you create a story, with an arc?
Are there compelling characters? What makes them compelling?
Will events overtake your book?
Do you have an agent? You need one.

Proposal

A proposal is a marketing brochure; it is your sales pitch
Rewrite, revise, redo, polish, start all over until you have a mini-book
How does your story end? Even a policy book has a beginning, middle and end.
Like ledes and the first lines of books, proposals should intrigue first
Once you have the reader engaged inform potential BUYERS about
Why the book matters
Why readers would buy it (other books like it?)
What makes your book different
Why it would be better than the competition
How long it will be, in words â€“ photos or graphics?
When you propose to deliver (deadline)
How you plan to promote your book; marketing plan

Work Plan
Write an outline.
Write a work plan (Excel?) chapter-by chapter with length, deadlines
Organize your files
Keep your files organized; put everything back
Budget; write one and stick to it
Plan travel well in advance
Plan how to make use of extra time on the road
Keep thorough business records, write contracts
