1. Intros and overview

How we’re gonna do this
●
●
●
●
●

4 modules. Each will have 30 mins of instruction, 20 mins for an exercise and questions, and a 10
min break.
One of us will teach a module, and the other will be available for help and to monitor the Q&A box
for questions.
DM whichever one of us isn’t teaching if you’re having an issue with a tool or with following along.
But in general, please put your questions in the main Q&A box so everyone can beneﬁt.
Feel free to use your own examples to test out the tools and techniques. It’s great to use this time
to make progress on accounts, websites, Facebook pages etc. you’re investigating.
All personal examples shared or asked about are yours alone. No one will take them or pursue them
outside of this class.

2. Monitoring and analysis of
social media content and
accounts

Thinking through social usage
When you’re using social media to search or monitor, think through how different
users would experience it. What would a person involved in a disaster post? How
would a provocateur or bad actor frame their message?
Beware of attempts to manipulate you. Verify documents and ask for original
copies of photos and images to be emailed to you. If a source gets in touch, verify
their identity.
Be open to your audience. Include easy ways to contact you, make sure your
afﬁliations are clear, and link to your work.

Copying Twitter lists
Finding lists on Twitter can be tricky and tedious — your best bet is sifting through
proﬁles of inﬂuential people who may have created them. There’s a better way,
which uses a trick I originally learned from Bellingcat.
1.
2.
3.

Open Google
Type in: site:twitter.com/*/lists “LIST-NAME-HERE”
Use this tool to duplicate the list to your account:
projects.noahliebman.net/listcopy

Tips: Keep list search terms simple and general. Copy list instead of following it so you can
modify it.

Let’s put it all together
Twitter Search: bit.ly/plandemic-tw
CrowdTangle Search: bit.ly/plandemic-ct

Finding deleted tweets
1. Go Back In Time Chrome extension allows to search through archives or caches
of the page you’re on. (Always check Bing!)
2. Archive.is, a website widely used for social media archiving.
3. ThreaderApp website, threadreaderapp.com, is searchable and includes video,
images, and gifs.
4. Polititweet.org tracks removed tweets from key public ﬁgures.
5. Searching replies with an image for a screenshot. (But beware of fakes!)

Hurricane Laura. Use this as an
opportunity to try diﬀerent ﬁlters
and features. Compare content
across platforms.

3. Investigating Websites

How To Read A Website
•Click on all main menus and scroll down to the footer to ﬁnd other pages worth visiting. In general, visit lots of
pages, click tons of links, and familiarize yourself with the site.
•Does it identify the owner or any corporate entity on its About page? Also note if it doesn’t have an About
page.
•Does it list a company or person in a copyright notice at the very bottom of the homepage or any other page?
•Does it list any names, addresses or corporate entities in the privacy policy or terms and conditions? Are
those different from what’s listed on the footer, about page or other places on the site?
•If the site publishes articles, note the bylines and if they are clickable. See if they lead to an author page with
more information.
•Google article and About text to see if it’s plagiarized.
•Does the site feature related social media accounts? Visit them.
•Does the site list any products, clients, testimonials etc. that may be worth looking into?

Go here:
patriots4truth.org

Analyzing Social Engagement
Two tools we’ll use:

• app.buzzsumo.com/content/web to enter the URL and see some of the most
shared/engaged content across social networks. Open this in your browser now.

• The CrowdTangle browser extension to see more detailed sharing info to help identify
connected Facebook pages, Twitter accounts, etc.

Other Tips
• Google “domain.com” to see info/mentions about the site.
• Paste the URL into Facebook and Twitter (remove “http://“) to see who’s sharing and talking about its
content.
• Use the free version of SimilarWeb.com to see how much trafﬁc it receives, from where, etc.
• If you’re interested in a speciﬁc page, look for additional archived versions of it using the WayMachine
extension as well, as archive.today and cachedview.com.

Whois searches
SITE TO INVESTIGATE:
● patriots4truth.org
TOOLS WE’LL USE:
•

Domainbigdata.com

•

whoisology.com

Free And Widely Used Software

Google Analytics & AdSense
• Do a ﬁnd on a webpage’s source code for “UA-” (Analytics) or “Pub-” (AdSense). This reveals the ID
linked to a speciﬁc account.
• Run that through sites like BuiltWith.com SpyOnWeb.com and DNSlytics.com to see if other websites
are using the same Google Analytics code or AdSense ID.
• Also remember you can grab a Google Analytics or AdSense ID from the Wayback Machine!

Go To: WolfTribune.com

• Go to the “Edit” menu in Chrome/Firefox. Select
“Find.”

• Enter “UA-” in the search box

• This should pop up:

• Go to the “Edit” menu in Chrome/Firefox. Select
“Find.”

• Enter “pub-” in the search box (for AdSense) and this
should pop up:

Enter That Here: DNSlytics.com/reverse-analytics

At Least 10 Domains Have/Had That Code

At Least 10 Domains Have/Had That Code
There also
seems to be
an AdSense
ID worth
checking.

Now Enter The “UA-“ ID Into SpyOnWeb.com

We Get Additional Domain Hits

4. Finding People And Online
Identities

Approaches to finding people
There’s no catch-all method to finding people and you often have to try a few different things.
Try to get the person’s name, location, and what they look like at the outset.
If you come across their social media profile, note their friends or family, coworkers.
Try a reverse image search on their profile photo to find other accounts.
Use a username finder to find other account.
Google search operators and different approaches can be helpful.
Gather as much information as possible before deciding what you’re going to use.
If you have the budget, use a service called SkopeNow.

Kamala case study:
At this point we’ve gathered:
Website names
C.T. Wells
Tyla Wells
Schoolhouse Communities
Michigan

What else could we have tried?

Both lead to her Facebook account:

What to do with an empty FB account?

Only have a username?

●
●
●

Try namechk.com
inurl:
“username”

Only have an image?
Reverse image search every
proﬁle photo across search
engines.
Yandex will have different
results from Bing, which will
have different results from
Google.
Try reverse searching other
images on the account to see if
they were posted elsewhere,
including from gatherings,
celebrations, etc.

4. Network Analysis: Tying it all
together

“The goal is to find as much of the operation
as possible before reporting it, because once
the operation is reported, the operators can
be expected to hide — potentially by deleting
or abandoning other assets.”
— Ben Nimmo, The Verification Handbook,
Chapter 11

People: Tyla Wells
Assets: websites, YouTube Channel, podcast, Facebook proﬁle, LinkedIn proﬁle, Twitter etc.
Companies: Schoolhouse Learning Communities etc.

ZestAds appears to be the company selling the mask

Wait, that’s a different
company.

Find More Customers in The FB Group
We want:
• URLs of other stores from
their receipts.
• Confirmation that it’s
ZestAds receiving the
money.
• Quotes and any other
details, such as other
Facebook pages.

Snowballing To Find The Network Of Stores And Pages
• Get store URLs from customer receipts.
• See if the stores share any similar characteristics, such as text or company info. Is there a pattern, and
can we connect it to ZestAds?
• Search for places on Facebook or elsewhere that are linked to those stores to make more
connections.
• Use whois to examine store domain registration records to establish additional connections.

Store “About Us” Pages

Search Repeated Text “In Quotes”

Search Repeated Text “In Quotes”

Visit each site, conﬁrm
it’s the same template,
add it to a spreadsheet.
Repeat.

Find the Facebook Page(s) For Each Store

Do this for each site, visit the
page to conﬁrm it lists the store
in its About tab, check the Page
Transparency info for manager
location, add it to a spreadsheet.
Repeat.

Pages/Stores

Run Whois Searches On The Store URLs
Every web domain is listed in a
central database. You can run
a “whois” search to learn when
it was registered and, if lucky,
who registered it. Sometimes
you only receive partial info,
as I did when I ran a bulk whois
search of the store URLs in
Domain Tools.
A great free whois tool is
domainbigdata.com

Exercise: WolfTribune.com

Where You Could Go From Here
• Content analysis: search the site’s About text and other content to see if it’s stolen and/or links it to
other sites. See if/where it’s being shared online. Connected social accounts?
• Perform whois searches to gather additional ownership info.
• Analyze TeCake.com and TeCake.in and other linked domains to see if it leads to other sites.
• Use your people/account analysis skills to investigate the people listed as the owners of
TeCake.com/TeCake.in and other sites. What else do they own?
