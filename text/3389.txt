QUICK HITS
BECOME INDISPENSABLE - Be g.a's best friend on a daily basis with tips you hand off. You get more
tips than anyone and you can't do them all. Pass off some of what your get in daily calls and emails from
litany of sources who come to you as the trusted brand. Develop relationships beyond g.a. beats.
KEEP THE ‘IN’ BIN FULL OF POTENTIAL STORIES
Sign up to get meeting agendas (including special meeting agendas) for various local and state agencies
(i.e. water districts, planning board, airport, health districts, etc). Not the city councils or supervisor
meetings that everyone covers but the smaller boards or committees within city or county governments.
Sometimes you can sign up for the emails on the agency’s website. If that’s not an option, write them a
letter stating your request. Zip through the agendas and in time; you will develop an “eye” for anything out
of the ordinary.
BE THE BREAKING NEWS HERO - beef up breaking news coverage with investigative tools, using
resources listed below. Know where to get records. Add the angle the others can't because they don't
have your skill set. It's not what you know; it's knowing where to look.
DO “BASEBALL JOURNALISM.” Don’t just swing for the fences. Standup doubles are just fine.
Sometimes it’s just good to get on base. These can include exclusives that are truly strong g.a. stories or
true short-form investigations.
DON'T BE AFRAID TO GO BACK TO THE SAME WELL. That means folo-ups - court actions, legislative
solutions, any updates that get your brand out there
LAST WORD: Just because it's quantity, doesn't mean it's not quality - you still make it special, better than
average g.a. story, not just in content and extra investigative zing, but in better writing, better construction, better
production value if possible.

IN-DEPTH INVESTIGATIONS
OPEN RECORDS - Spend half-hour a week to place open records requests. Consider having a couple
versions, one “softer” request, one straight up. Set a goal of two requests a week and have a system to
track the progress of each request. Once you get on a roll, you’re going to find some nice nuggets. Not
sure what to do first? Ask for expense records from public enitities in your community. Look for greed or
stupidity at work. How much overtime do firefighters get in your city? Who get’s to take home agency
cars? Who is taking the out of town trips for the planning department?
ONGOING "ROLLING INVESTIGATIONS" - when you can't or don't want to hold off as nuggets of
information come in.

GUT CHECK - If you're doing Big J without the big investigative unit, brainstorm with investigative friends
