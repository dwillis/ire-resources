You Can Do It!
Time and time again we have seen journalists and citizens denied public record requests
and left with no recourse other than to sue. Yet, how many journalists – or journalism
organizations – have the resources or gumption to file a lawsuit? Unfortunately, very few, and
research shows fewer news organizations are willing to sue. The intimidation factor itself is the
largest barrier, and a lot of government agencies know that, following the unwritten policy of
only releasing sensitive records when a suit is actually filed. You can stand up to that. Sometimes
simply filing a lawsuit will dislodge the records, and at minimum it makes for a good news peg
to expose unnecessary government secrecy. This handout will walk you through the pro se
(pronounced “pro say”) process of suing on your own, and where you can get the resources to
cover your costs. You can do it!

Using This Guide
As mentioned on the first page, this is not to be considered legal advice, rather a starting
point to educate you about the process of suing for public records. If you need legal advice, reach
out to the resources listed at the end of this document. A lot of this information is focused on
federal FOIA, but the same principles apply for suing a city or state agency under state public
records laws. While the process might seem daunting at first, it’s not rocket science. Here are
overall thoughts for starting out:
• Realize this will be a long battle, but DON’T GIVE UP! A typical FOIA case can last
a year, or longer, especially if the government intends to litigate, but don’t let this scare
you. It might not serve your initial daily story, but it will help you get records in the
future, and send a message to agencies throughout your community that they can’t get
away with gaming the system when you request records.
• Don’t take things personally. What the attorneys write in their motions is part of their
job. Don’t take their attacks personally and you will do a better job at defeating them.
• Realize you won’t win every time. Realize that there are indeed some legal exemptions
which might actually apply to the records sought. Focus on your strong elements. Be
willing to seek help, or even cut bait if you have to. Don’t set bad precedent. Live to fight
another day!

Before Suing
Make sure you crossed your t’s and dotted your i’s when it comes to the initial public
records request. It is better to fix any procedural errors that you made prior to suing than
worrying about having the government move to dismiss the lawsuit after you filed.
•

Learn the law
o Read resources that explain the public records law. For federal FOIA, the
Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press has a great guide at
https://www.rcfp.org/federal-open-government-guide, including sample FOIA
request letters and appeal letters. Reporters Committee’s Open Government Guide
provides a good explanation of each state public records law, as well.
o Read the full text of the law and relevant court opinions.
o Consult experts, such as your state press association or open government coalition
if it’s a state/local issue, or the Reporters Committee if it’s a federal issue. Look
2

for recent cases regarding your specific record. See the list of resources at the end
of this handout.
o If your case is a little fuzzy – no strong case law or precedent established to
support you, then you might consider going with a professional attorney. The only
thing worse than losing a records lawsuit is setting bad precedent for everyone
else. If the law is on your side and recent rulings have strongly supported your
position, then proceed.
•

Know the agency rules
o Each federal agency has regulations governing how to submit FOIA requests, and
state and local agencies usually have their own processes. Follow the instructions.
If you didn’t do so initially, go ahead and submit a new request, under compliance
with the regulations. Then, wait the necessary time period prior to continuing.
o Your request should have also clearly stated it was a FOIA request (if federal) or
public records request (if state/local) and not consisted merely of questions –
agencies are not required to answer questions, they provide documents instead.

•

Take good notes
o Record everything you can during the request process, including when you talk to
people and what was said. Have it in writing (e.g., email), if possible.
o Create a timeline so you are clear on how things progressed with your request.
Note when the agency has missed its deadlines. Federal FOIA provides agencies
with 20 working days to comply with a FOIA request. There are exceptions to the
rule, in cases where “unusual circumstances” are invoked. In those circumstances,
the deadline is typically extended to 30 working days. The timer starts when the
agency acknowledges the request, unless the agency takes longer than 10 working
days to acknowledge the request. However, if you sent the request directly to the
office responsible for the request (very unlikely), the timer starts right away. Each
state public records law has its own timetable.

•

Clarify and ask for fee waiver
o At the federal level, agencies are allowed to 1) assess fees for FOIA requests and
2) request clarification for FOIA requests. You must prove that there is
justification for a fee waiver (waivers are provided for the news media), or pay
the fees. If you pay the fees, the agency is still required to comply with the request
within the deadlines, unless you agreed to an extension or unusual circumstances
are invoked. Agencies are also allowed to request clarification or narrow a FOIA
request. You should promptly provide the requested clarification. In either of
these cases, the agency “pauses” the clock until it receives the clarification
regarding the request or fees.

•

Inquire about a completion date
o Attempt to work with the agency to get an estimated status date by which it
expects it will complete the request. Federal FOIA requires agencies to provide an

3

estimated completion date upon request. 1 Email a few times, a few days apart,
requesting the completion date. This is also a good step to show the court the
agency is engaging in bad faith, and that you were acting in good faith. This will
help when you try to recover fees in the future. However, don’t let a date that is
months away scare you away from filing the lawsuit.

1

•

Appeal administratively
o Research indicates that a third of the time an administrative appeal will cut
records loose, saving you the hassle of litigation. Appeal the agency’s lack of
response or its denial. At the federal level this will force you to wait another 20
working days before suing, as the agency will have to lapse on the deadline for
the appeal as well. At the state/local level, a simple letter to the agency asking for
it to reconsider its decision can suffice and show the court you are reasonable.
Some states allow you to appeal to the attorney general or a commission (e.g.,
Connecticut).
o Be sure to submit the administrative appeal to the appropriate FOIA appeals
inbox. FOIA allows you to appeal the failure to comply with a request, which is
called a “constructive denial.” Although this will delay your ability to sue right
away, it will show the court that you were trying to avoid litigation and were
trying to work the issue out with the agency versus the courthouse.

•

Exhaust all other options
Sometimes the best way to get public records is through cajoling, political
pressure, public shaming, or skillful negotiation.
o Narrow the request to specifically what you need.
o Publicize the denial, focusing on how it affects average people. Go up the ladder
to elected officials to ask why their agency is hiding information. Request the
same record of peer agencies and note their deviance (research shows the pressure
causes agencies to cough up records – nobody wants to appear deviant).
o These and more tactics are outlined in the CQ Press book, “The Art of Access:
Strategies for Acquiring Public Records,” by David Cuillier and Charles N. Davis.

•

Get support
If you get nowhere with an administrative appeal and decide to sue, apply for aid
to help cover your costs (make sure to keep receipts for all expenses related to the
request/suit, such as parking, mailing, court fees, etc.):
o The National Freedom of Information Coalition Knight Litigation Fund
(http://www.nfoic.org/knight-foi-fund) provides assistance for court fees.
o The Society of Professional Journalists’ Legal Defense Fund offers funds toward
attorney fees (https://www.spj.org/ldf.asp). In both grant cases, you have to apply,
but it’s a simple process.
o Check with media law attorneys in your area to see if anyone will take it pro bono
or on contingency. This could save you a lot of time and heartache.

Taking Them to Court
After considering the above, it is time to sue. Ask the agency one last time for an
estimated completion date in an effort to further show that they, not you, are the ones being
unreasonable. If you get rebuffed or ignored, sue. Here is how:

1. Get to know the court
If it’s a federal FOIA case, look up U.S. District Court in your area and visit the
courthouse. For a federal record, you are allowed to sue in the U.S. District Court
where you live, the U.S. District Court where the records are kept, or the U.S. District
Court of the District of Columbia. It is probably easiest to sue in the district court
where you live if you need to go to an oral hearing. If it’s a state/local record, visit
your county courthouse. Many court websites have sections designed for pro se
parties, including forms and examples of complaints. Refer to these. If they don’t,
refer to the local rules, specifically the section about commencing or initiating a civil
action. Courts do things differently, and some will require you to provide a cover
sheet, notice of interested parties, or other documents. If in doubt, call or visit the
court clerk’s office. Be friendly. Clerks are usually helpful, and while they can’t give
legal advice they are usually willing to answer procedural questions.

2. Write the complaint
The meat of your suit is the “complaint,” which states who you are, who you are
suing, what happened, and what you want. It launches the lawsuit. You need to
provide sufficient information to say what you want and why (because you were
wronged). However, do not make the mistake of including all your arguments in the
complaint. The government has the burden of proving that they met the legal standard
to deny your public records request. Don’t argue something when you don’t have
their argument in front of you. Also, don’t give them ideas as to what to argue. Don’t
try to write it to sound like a lawyer. Just write it clearly. Follow the court rules,
which outline the exact process, even the formatting of complaints, such as font and
margin size. Some courts provide complaint templates. We have included a sample
FOIA suit complaint at the end of this handout.

3. Fill out the summons
The summons notifies the government that it is being sued. Download the summons
template from the court website under the forms section. Do not sign the summons,
the clerk will. Prepare three versions. When serving the federal government, you need
to serve the Department of Justice U.S. Attorney General, the Civil Process Clerk for
the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the district you are suing in, as well as the agency you
are suing. Your complaint also needs exhibits, such as the records request, agency
acknowledgment, and any communications with the agency. If the agency has an
overlying “department,” such as the Federal Aviation Administration under the
Department of Transportation, sue both agencies. It is likely you will need to take
three copies of everything to the courthouse. One will be for the clerk, one for the
judge, and one for you. You will then use your copy to make the additional copies
needed to serve the government with the lawsuit.
5

4. Go to the courthouse
Now that you have everything ready, head over to the courthouse. If you are suing for
federal records, go to your nearest U.S. District Court. If you are suing for local/state
records, head to your nearest county courthouse. Unfortunately, most courts do not
allow pro se individuals to file cases online. Be sure to go with the filing fee, which
can be paid with credit card. At federal court that can run about $400, and county
courts for local/state records cases are usually less. See page 4 where you can apply
for funds from the NFOIC Knight Litigation Fund. When you arrive, go to the civil
clerk’s office, and explain you want to sue. Give them the documents you have, and
they will take care of the rest. They will return stamped copies to you. While there,
ask about the possibility of seeing filed documents online. This will greatly reduce the
time it takes to receive documents filed in your case.

5. Serve the agency
Now you need to notify the government that it has been sued. You must serve all the
defendants (the agency/department), and in the case of the federal government, the
U.S. Attorney General at the Department of Justice, and the Civil Process Clerk at the
U.S. Attorney’s Office in the district you sued in. You can do this by certified mail
with return receipt. Note, however, that someone else must serve the documents. This
can be your family member, neighbor, etc., as long as they are over 18, and not the
person suing. In your mailing, include all the documents you filed with the court,
including the summons, and a “proof of service” form, which you can obtain from the
clerk. Note that you normally have to utilize the “other” checkbox on the form since
you are suing the government instead of a person, and the rules for serving the
government are different. Do not sign the form, but make copies. Just include the
form in the mailing. This notifies everyone of the date they were served. Service can
take several weeks, as the mail slows down once it reaches the post office which
serves the agency while it goes through the needed security screenings. It will take a
few days to get back the green cards proving that the documents were served. Make
copies of those cards, and fill out the rest of the proof of service form, and mail three
copies of that to the Clerk of the Court. This will tell the court that you did your part
with serving the government and sets the date by which the agency needs to reply.

6. Wait for an answer
The “answer” is the agency answering every paragraph of your complaint. For the
most part. The agency will likely deny most everything you claim, except what you
included in an exhibit or that can be easily proven by you. Do not take the answer
personally. At the federal level, the government has 30 days to file an answer. Some
courts incorrectly issue a 60-day summons but government lawyers will typically take
steps to correct this mistake. The next step will likely be that a government lawyer
calls you or emails you. Note, this person represents the government, not you.
However, you must work together to reach a resolution in your case, as you don’t
have a lawyer. At the federal level the DOJ will request an extension to filing an
answer to the complaint you filed. It is a good idea to grant this. The DOJ will try to
resolve the issues without resorting to further litigation. It is possible that the DOJ
will get the agency to respond to your request and avoid the need to file an answer. In
6

this situation, the case will be dismissed through a joint request or stipulation. Be sure
to read the joint request for provisions stating you won’t be allowed to recover the
money from the court expenses you incurred. If so, reach out to the DOJ and let them
know not to include that provision. You can try to recover court fees as a pro se
litigant (that doesn’t include copy fees, attorney fees, or fees for your own time).

7. Haggle
The next stage will involve some back and forth communications, and might lead to
closing the case immediately. Some courts require the parties meet and prepare a joint
proposal for deadlines; others make the deadlines themselves. It is possible that
portions of the request you submitted can be resolved during this phase. The agency
might be willing to negotiate, seeing you are serious. Check online with resources
such as the Federal FOIA Appeals Guide at www.rcfp.org/federal-foia-appeals-guide
to see if any claimed exemptions are worth disputing. If something is not worth
disputing, advise the agency that you will not object to those portions of their
response. If no issues remain, the case should be dismissed by mutual consent. If
issues remain, dispositive motions are next.
8. Respond to dispositive motion
A dispositive motion attempts to get the judge to dispose of the case from the get-go.
This can be done through one of two ways: Motion to Dismiss or Motion for
Summary Judgment. Read the agency’s dispositive motion carefully. At the federal
level, utilize the Reporters Committee guide noted above, as well as the DOJ
litigation guide specific for the exemptions invoked -https://www.justice.gov/oip/doj-guide-freedom-information-act-0. For a Motion for
Summary Judgment, you must identify that the agency is 1) not correct in one of the
facts which would decide the case and/or 2) the agency is not entitled to judgment in
its favor. Using the guides noted above, work on a “Response to the Motion.” Check
the local rules to see how much time you have to file. If you would like more time,
request the agency consent to an extension, and then, with that consent (or denial),
ask the court to approve. Work on your response carefully. Explain why the records
are important to the public. Include as much information in your briefs as possible in
case a new judge is assigned to the case. Make constant revisions. Attack the
agency’s arguments, and make sure you read and understand the arguments the
agency is relying on. If the agency missed an important part required to be able to
survive claiming the exemption, make sure to state that. Your response to the motion
needs to comply with any page limits and formatting noted in the local rules for that
court. Also, you must use a “Statement of Facts” for every single material fact you
rely on. A material fact is something important that can decide the case. Your motion
will basically have a lot of in-text citations to the Statement of Facts, similar to that of
the agency’s. You will then have a separate Statement of Facts Document, similar to
the agency’s, and each Statement of Fact must be supported by adequate evidence.
This evidence can be either a declaration, or, an exhibit. Keeping the Statement of
Facts, argument, and exhibits organized is the most time consuming portion, but be
sure to do it right, because it will help your case. When responding to the motion,
research the cases the agency uses to support its argument. Find distinctions between
7

your case and the cases cited. Show that to the court. Also, review the evidence
carefully – if the agency provides a declaration or affidavit and then jumps to
conclusions using words not in the declaration or affidavit, point that out. Below the
title of your response, state that you want an Oral Hearing or Argument, if you want
one. This can be good for your case if you feel speaking to a judge can help.
However, do not think of this court appearance as another way to introduce newly
found arguments into your case. File your response with the court after it is
completed and be sure to provide the agency, DOJ and U.S. Attorney with a copy.

9. Respond to agency reply
Next, the agency will file a “reply” to your “response.” It is also likely that the agency
will look at your response and ask for an extension to file a reply. They might want
the extension just to have it, or maybe they actually want to provide additional
records in an effort to avoid the judge deciding the issue. Communicate with the
agency to see what their position is shortly after filing the response. Next thing you
know you may have more documents. After the reply is filed, you are not allowed to
file another reply without consent from the court. Typically, this consent isn’t
granted except for circumstances where you can show that the agency’s reply was
introducing substantially new information which you haven’t had a chance to attack.

10. Oral arguments or final decision
The judge may schedule an oral hearing, or simply decide the case without a hearing.
Either way, be sure to read the judge’s decision carefully. If you lose the case,
consider meeting with an attorney to review your appeal options.

11.Moving for costs
If you win the case, or if the case was dismissed after a joint request, it is possible you
can recover costs if you substantially prevail. Refer to the local rules for the time
limits to do this, and apply using the forms on the court website to “tax” costs. Be
sure to keep the agency informed and provide them with a copy of the forms. In your
forms, provide additional information proving that you are eligible and entitled to
recovery of costs. Costs are in the form of printing, parking, mailing, case filing, etc.
You are eligible and entitled if you won’t use the documents obtained for commercial
purpose, and if the agency “changed position” as a result of the lawsuit. All those
estimated status date requests at the beginning come in handy now.

12.Plant that head on a pike
Publicize your brilliant victory and thank all of those who helped. Make sure the
word is out in your community, nationally through SPJ and NFOIC, and throughout
the government community, so everyone knows about the win. Plant that head on a
pike as a warning to other recalcitrant agencies that illegal denials will be thumped in
court. Submit a new public records request asking for all agency communications
pertaining to your initial request and lawsuit. That can help you learn about their
thinking for the next time you sue. Revel in your tenacity and efforts to protect
democracy and the people’s right to know. Huzzah!
