Why data?

 Uncover basic information.
 Test government officials, procedures,

regulations and promises.
 Enterprise reporting – do stories that no one

else is doing.
 Interactive graphics on the web and online

storytelling

 Why are you here? What do you need to

accomplish?
 Go to the sessions that will get you where you

need to be.
 Network with those that can help you.

 Three different kinds of session at this

conference: Panels, demos and hands-on
 At each time slot, there are sessions available

for all experience levels.
 Mini boot camp vs. other hands-on classes.

 Go to the overview sessions to get a sense of

what’s possible.
 Go to the bar and strike up a conversation – just
remember that we don’t all have great social
skills.
 Go to hands on sessions for things you want to
learn – get their early and talk with the teacher
about ideas
 If you want to know more about what someone
talked about – make a date to see more of it.

 If you’re on the Web development side – go to

some more traditional CAR classes or
sessions
 If you spend most of your time digging
through data – go to some of the sessions on
interactive
 Find folks you can ask questions of AFTER the
conference.

 Some conversations you have will be over

your head. Don’t be discouraged: Focus on
the ones that apply to what you do.
 Go to the breaking news and “ideas” sessions
to get tangible ideas you can work on right
away.

 Start small.
 Think of CAR like a foreign language – you

have to practice and practice often.
 Get your editor/producer excited about what
you’re doing. If they don’t “get” CAR, teach
them.
 Teach someone else.
 Working on a story? Find similar ones done
elsewhere to help you get going on the
analysis and questions.

 If you’re struggling with something, reach out

for help. The NICAR list (archives) is great. Also
feel free to contact IRE at datalib@ire.org.
 Put crib notes up next to your desk to help you
remember things.
 Unless you want to be a news app developer,
remember that it’s about data analysis and
those skills.
 Don’t downplay the value and power of a
spreadsheet.

 Don’t forget to use IRE’s tipsheets and story

database.
 Check out the practice data sets on IRE’s site.
