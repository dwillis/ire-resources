Covering schools and school construction. Ideas for spotting corruption, mismanagement, and wasted
funds.

•

Get a student head count at start of school year, and school building capacity data. Map which
schools are too crowded and those that have empty desks. Compare to projections over the
years. Did the district build new schools or classroom additions in the right place?

•

Know who the school district lobbyists are that pitch board members and track their
involvements in political campaigns and the outcomes of whether their clients win work from
school boards.

•

Get the final Cost of Construction reports filed with the state Department of Education.
Compare them to the original votes on school projects. How much was the project expected to
cost at the start? How much was the construction contract for? How much was budgeted? Did
the price increase? Get the project’s change orders to see what additional money was spent on.

•

Get memos, emails from school district construction project managers. They can be warning
their bosses of problems, including escalating costs.

•

When a new school or classroom addition opens, especially if it opens on time at the start of the
year, make sure it has a final certificate of occupancy. Or is there a “temporary” one while
certain items are fixed. If so, what are those items? Are they detailed? Get a copy of the final
“punch list” or walk through the builders and district officials do, noting what items have yet to
be addressed. Was the school safe to open or did it open at the start of a new year simply to
meet a political promise?

•

Which construction companies are getting the most work in the district? Do the same ones get
the most work because they are reliable and dependable and offer a good price? Or do they get
work because they raise political funds from subcontractors and back the campaigns of board
members?

•

Get to know school district auditors. Request public records of what audits may be upcoming.
What records are they looking for? Audits can take months and months. Can you look at the
topic beforehand and break a story questioning how money was spent before an official audit
comes out?

•

Get copies of bid protests. Which losing companies are upset that they didn’t win a contract
and why? They may allege schemes to rig the awarding of projects. Or favors given to the
winning company.

•

Note when the school district hires consultants, then remember later to ask for copies of their
contracts and billing invoices. How much did they charge and what did they do? Was it a fair
price? Did the consultant already have a personal or business relationship with a top school
official?

•

Be aware of relationships. Did a subcontractor on a school project hire the nephew of the school
construction chief?

•

Get maintenance reports on the ongoing condition of buildings. In Florida, especially, mold can
be a real problem.

•

All bids should be opened in public. Go to a bid opening. Do they have companies faxing in bids
late? Are they negotiating terms and revising bids?

•

When a construction project is shelved, find out how much has already been paid, or still is due,
for the early work done by architects, engineers, contractors, etc.

•

Look for your school district suing contractors and architects ‐‐ and architects and contractors
suing your school district.

•

Is there a story to do on nepotism? Look at who is related in the district, especially top
managers, do they oversee any of their relatives? Did they have a hand in promotions or raises?

•

Look at records for road service calls for buses. Do certain buses break down all the time? Is the
fleet well maintained or do maintenance records show repeated problems?

•

Are certain teachers / schools being reprimanded by the state Department of Education for
coaching students on standardized tests?
