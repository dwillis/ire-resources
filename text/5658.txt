Do you trust your employee?

At a minimum…

 They need to be a self-motivated (second question I ask during interviews)
 They need to be lower maintenance
 Efficient communicator
 Can they self critique?

 They and you need to know their personality type

Management/employee relationship

 Video conference at least once a week (group and individual)
 Efficient communication (running list of subjects)
 Email is ugly. Use messaging software. (Slack, Gchat, Microsoft Teams)

Things to discuss with
employee/employer
 If you call/message and I don’t answer, what’s your reaction?
 What’s your work flow?
 How do you like to communicate?
 How often would you like to communicate?
 Set office hours or flexible schedule?

 When I log off/on, do you want to know?
 How are office supplies handled?
 How often would you like me in the office? If it’s out of state, will the company pay for travel,
meals, hotel?
 How many days will I need to travel?

 Is the pay based on skills or standard of living?

And finally…

Get it in writing
