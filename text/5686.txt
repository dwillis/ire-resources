Tracking the opioid epidemic(s) using
WONDER
The CDC’s Multiple Underlying Cause of Death public use database

Mining data, spotting dodgy medical coding and questioning chemistry

Every major
federal database
and several state
databases share
flaws.
Workaround:
Comparing
databases

Heroin to morphine: the
biochemistry problem in
death databases

Overly broad
groupings of
opioids and
certain
stimulants,
distorting
numbers

Lag time/provisional
data updates

Suppressed data
due to HIPAA

Death databases
dependent on
local coroners
and medical
examiners

Different states count
different drugs
differently

Polydrug addiction is rising, especially among
younger users
• Methamphetamine
Emerging in East and in Florida

• Cocaine
More coca under cultivation in
Colombia than has ever been
recorded

Heroin and fentanyl, depressants, have been found in both drugs,
which are stimulants. Traditionally, a person’s drug of choice was a
stimulant or depressant- not both.

WONDER:
Counting drugs, not people
• Multiple Underlying Cause of Death allows medical
examiners/coroners to list up to 20 different drugs on a death
certificate
• Counts drugs present at death whether they caused the death or
not
• Counting only the drug that is the cause of death rather than drugs
present at death risks confusing the lethality of a drug with the
scope of its use
• Polydrug toxicity: Fewer and fewer people are dying from just one
drug anymore.
• The language of WONDER: “heroin-related” deaths, for instance,
not “heroin-caused” deaths.

Select “current” to capture time and detail

The CDC suppresses
data results when
small numbers might
make it possible to
identify an individual.
And it makes you
promise not to,
either.

Layout: Location, time frames, demographics, drugs
• Tip: Grouping
by leading
causes won’t
get you where
you want to go.
This and other
broad options,
such as “alcohol
& drug
induced” death
categories, are
too broad to
capture detail.

A query layout for a search which will capture one
state, one year, two drugs
When searching
for deaths linked
to more than one
drug, make sure
that you select
for “Multiple
Underlying Cause
of Death.”

Tip: rates
CDC considers rates based on
fewer than 20 deaths to be
unreliable. It will be indicated
on your query result.
We calculated our own rates
based on fewer than 20
because, even if unreliable,
we needed to understand
trends.

2. Where did they die? Location of death.
• Select a single state, a group of
states, or the U.S.
• You can also select from either a
census or HHS region/state
grouping.

Tip: States and specific drug trends
• Some Midwestern states historically had a smaller heroin problem,
and you will always run up against suppressed data for that drug, in
certain years, on a statewide basis.
• Similarly, some states and regions have historically had very few
deaths tied to methamphetamine.
• Heroin deaths started going down in about 2001-02, and so even
states now racked by heroin may have suppressed annual data in
the early 2000s.

Location option: Selecting for individual
counties
• To search for deaths in
a single county or
clusters of counties,
click on the selected
state, and select from a
menu for counties.
• If you selected counties
in your layout, the
state selection will
return all counties in
that state by default.

Location option:
Select for urban
area

Large central metro—Counties in metropolitan statistical areas of 1
million or more population that:
Contain the entire population of the largest principal city
Have their entire population contained in the largest principal
city
Contain at least 250,000 inhabitants of any principal city
Large fringe metro—Counties of 1 million or more population that
did not qualify as large central metro counties.
Medium metro—Counties of populations of 250,000 to 999,999.
Small metro—Counties of populations less than 250,000.
Micropolitan—Counties in micropolitan statistical areas that have a
population of at least 10,000 but less than 50,000.
Noncore—Nonmetropolitan counties that did not qualify as
micropolitan.

3. Who died?
Option: Select for demographics. No selection
returns all.

Tip: Narrow a field to avoid a wall
The more filters you include in your selections, whether demographics, time or place, the
more likely you are to hit the brick wall of suppressed data.
Workaround: Try broadening your search: Instead of choosing just one age group, for
instance, select for multiple ages. Select multiple counties in a state instead of just one
county, or select the state. If you come up against suppressed data in a single state,
consider grouping that and other states into an appropriate region, or use an HHS region.

4. When did they die? Select for years & months
• Select for one year, a
group of years or all years
from 1999-2016.
• If you selected months in
the layout, the year
selection will return all
months in a selected
year.
• If you want a specific
month or months, first
select a state, then use
the dropdown box option
to select from that state.

5. Option: Select for days, places and autopsies.
No selection returns all.

6. How did they die?

Select

UCD-ICD-10 Codes for Underlying Cause of Death. Shows manner of death.

Under VO1-Y89
(External causes…)
Select for:
Unintentional X4044
Suicide X60-X64
Assault X85
Undetermined
Y40-Y44

7.What drugs did they take?
Select from MCD- ICD-10 drug codes

• Selecting from the
MCD-ICD-10 codes
will allow you to
broadly search for
specific drugs and
combinations

ICD drug category codes most commonly tied to
the current epidemics.
• T40.0 Opium
• T40.1 Heroin
• T40.2 Natural and semisynthetic opioids; such as oxycodone,
hydrocodone and morphine, a byproduct of heroin
overdoses. Not methadone.
T40.4 Synthetic opioids, including fentanyl and tramadol
• T40.5 Cocaine
• T43.6 Psychostimulants with abuse potential; includes
methamphetamine

Drug combination query example: deaths linked to
heroin or opium when either is combined with cocaine
Top box= Either
More than one drug
code in the top box will
return results for
deaths in which either
drug was involved.
Lower box= And
A drug in the top and
bottom box will return
results for deaths in
which both were
involved.

8. Results can be exported, or displayed to CDC’s default
layout, which can also be exported.

Tip: Make sure you select for showing suppressed values:
You want to know what you don’t know.

Hitting the Wall: Suppressed data
If the number of deaths is less than 10, this will be reflected as suppressed
data in your query results. All you will know is that it is between one and 9.
Workarounds:
•
•
•
•

Calculate aggregate numbers substituting the number five. Just be sure
and tell your readers.
Calculate by substituting 1,5 and 9 to see the trendline.
Broaden the search parameters.
Consider whether it is possible to omit an element- certain states, for
instance- and calculate based only on states with unsuppressed data.

And one more thing.

Example: Hamilton County, Ohio, deaths, heroin,
by month, 2014 and early 2015,
substituting suppressed data with 5, 1 and 9 to confirm trends.

Tip: Sometimes, suppressed data tells
tales

Tip: Death data with such
obvious omissions/denial-of-alllogic issues frequently points to
serious problems with the
coroner or medical examiner
system, including people in
charge of autopsies who don’t
have a clue about autopsies.

CDC Provisional Counts of
Drug Overdose Deaths
https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsr
r/drug-overdose-data
The CliffsNotes version of WONDER.
Provisionally speaking.

Data and searchable annual reports
State-level reports

TEDS, Treatment
Episode Data Set
Client-Level Substance
Abuse Treatment Data

https://www.samhsa.gov/data/data-we-collect/teds-treatmentepisode-data-set
What you get: Admissions and discharges show which specific drugs
people are seeking help for in specific states. Discharge detail is
granular: age, ethnicity, more. Can do historical trend analysis.
Counts people in outpatient, residential, and hospital inpatient
treatment.
What you don’t: Primarily counts admissions to publicly financed
treatment. Cuts in public treatment may make it appear as though
drug use is falling. States can wait years to submit reports. Data can
be amended after publication, so the annual published data report
does not always coincide with the online data.

TEDS: mandatory reporting in slow motion

N-SSATS, National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services
https://www.samhsa.gov/data/substance-abuse-facilities-data-nssats

• What you get: Annual report on state-level treatment facilities, includes number of people seeking
treatment by type and by state. Details detox facilities as well as methadone clinics, and whether
treatment facilities are private or public pay. Historical data.
• What you don’t: While this offers strong state-level detail about facilities, it does not offer granular
information about drugs. It does show the number of facilities offering certain kinds of treatment:
methadone treatment for opioid addiction, for instance.

NSDUH: National Survey on Drug use and health
https://nsduhweb.rti.org
What you get: This is the primary source of information on substance use in the U.S. Annual surveys of
individuals 12 and up of people in households. Also shows numbers of individuals who sought
treatment but did not receive it, by state.
What you don’t: People in residential treatment, prisons/jail and hospitals are not counted. Heroin is
widely believed to be undercounted. The survey counts treatment for methamphetamine as treatment
for prescription drugs. Pre-2002 data may not be comparable with post-2002 data for comparison
purposes.

TEDS, NSDUH and N-SSATS can
contradict each other

State hospital discharge data
What you get: Everything. Data on overdoses by drug, illness related
to drug use, who paid for care, the charges, demographics and
location, at hospital-level detail. An amazing database.

What you don’t: It is maintained by individual states and there may be costs
involved in obtaining it. Historical data is complicated by the fact that
diagnostic coding changed in the last part of 2015. You will have to sign your
legal life away to use it, and the HIPAA restrictions are severe, including, in our
case, a commitment to destroying the data after a certain time period.
