Investigative Journalism for
Radio
Sandra Bartlett and John Ryan

Radio the Medium
• The true beauty of radio has to do with the
human voice and how our brains work.
• We are hard wired from infancy to listen to
human voices.
• We are hardwired for story telling.

Radio is immediate, Intimate
• Radio is intimate
• Radio is a conversation
• Radio can deal with complicated subjects

Planning
• News stories have one simple focus
• Documentaries can have more than one
focus but require more scenes
• How many separate stories are contained
in your investigation – Will you tell them
all?

Planning
• How much travel can you/will do?
• Will you take photos or video?
• Is your air date flexible?
• Set up deadlines – to finish research –
complete travel and interviews – to contact
people you want an accountability
interview from

Planning
• News stories short and to the point
• Explore the issues and complexities further with
a documentary
• Q and A with a show host with or without tape.
This allows you to talk about elements that are
difficult to bring into your stories
• Web treatments – audio diaries, video of
interviews

Taser use in Canada

Adding value
• Ongoing investigation suddenly daily news story.
• Death of a Polish man at Vancouver airport.
Robert Dziekanski was emigrating to Canada to
join his mother – he didn’t speak English – and
after hours wandering around the airport – he had
a short encounter with police and their Tasers. He
died within a few minutes.
• Radio was an effective tool in broadcasting our
investigation on the use of Tasers - in a serialized
form.

In what way?
How is that?

How did it manifest itself?

What's the evidence?
What do you make of it?
What makes you say that?
What was the difficult part?

Narrative Interviews
• Allow the interviewee to
play a part. Separating the
line between the
journalist as observer and
letting the character play
a real role. Can you get
the person to speak in the
present tense? – or get
into the moment in other
ways?

• Example: Taser/Riki
watching the
Dziekanski video
• Inserting yourself into
an intimate moment

Narrative Interviews
 Key characters – may have more to tell you
than you realize
 People remember more detail when asked to
start at the beginning
 Taking the person to the location or ask them
to describe the location
 Give or leave the equipment with the person

Getting the Narrative
• Roll on everything
• Let the moment speak for itself
• Interview in real, not manufactured situations
• Find the ways to bring it into the story telling

Accountability Interviews
• Your research goal is to know more
• Work from the outside towards the center
• Dealing with evasive answers – can’t or
won’t answer
• Don’t correct the liar
• Re-interview
• You are the boss of the interview

Writing the story
• News story or
documentary
• Surprise and tension
• Character
development
• Take your listener
some place

• Create an outline for
all stories
 Leave something out
• Describe appearance,
mannerisms
• Use scenes and
sounds for impact

Short, sharp, creative
• Declarative
statements
• Questions
• Cheeky, ironic

• Your research
supports you
• Your research
empowers you
• But don’t show all
your research – use it
to tell a powerful
story

Tension – Surprise
• Ending is known –
• Without misleading,
ending is unknown
lead in one direction
and end up
• Hold onto information
somewhere else
as you would a punch
line

Writing to the scene
• The phone call one day – prison interview the
next
• The phone call gave a natural seque in changing
scenes
• Enabled the reporter to move the story in several
directions

Story telling without tape

Re-creation
• The sequence of
events is crucial
• No one person knows
the whole story
• Legal issues prevent
people from telling
their story

• Documents
• Time line
• Be creative
• Explain why and how

Radio and Multimedia
• Radio in partnership
with multimedia
approach.
• Radio acts as the
headline, the teaser
for your headline.
Gets your hardest
findings out there fast
and other media
follow

• Some stories beg for
the full multi media
treatment for full
impact of your
investigation
• One character comes
to life in new way on
TV
• Multiple stuns impact

Multimedia Web
• Radio stories hit the main
findings and emotion
• TV - visual strength of
Taser shootings
• Web uses text, audio and
visuals
• Same investigation
different story telling
medium.
