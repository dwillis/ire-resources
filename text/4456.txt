Five Tips for Investigating Underrepresented Communities
1. Make it a habit to look at a potential investigative story through the lens of how it
may impact underrepresented communities. You might discover a whole new
dimension of your community.
2. Commit to diversifying your sources. Instead of using your favorite go-to expert,
try finding an expert from an underrepresented community. It may add greater
depth to your reporting and bring some new perspectives.
3. When investigating a story in an underrepresented community, research the
history of that community. It will provide context and help you ask better
questions.
4. Visit underrepresented communities. Attend community events and meet regular
folks. If people see you in their community on a regular basis (not just during a
controversy or conflict), it demonstrates that you care about getting to know their
community â€“ and ultimately that you care about getting the story right when you
cover them.
5. Subscribe to newspapers/newsletters produced by underrepresented
communities. This is a good way to learn about community happenings and
issues important to a particular group. It's also a good way to find story ideas.
