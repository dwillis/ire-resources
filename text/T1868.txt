COVERING LAW AND ORDER: IT’S A LIFESTYLE
FIVE TIPS FOR COVERING LAW ENFORCEMENT, THE
COURTS AND JUSTICE DEPARTMENT

I.) GET AHEAD BY THINKING LIKE THE COPS, PROSECUTORS AND DEFENSE
LAWYERS. Don’t wait for the court papers, press releases or interviews. Anticipate the
next move in an investigation and try to nail it down before the formal announcement.
II.) IN CRIME STORIES, THERE’S MORE THAN ONE WAY TO SKIN A CAT. Don’t
assume because law enforcement officials won’t or can’t legally talk to you that you can’t
get the story. In court cases and investigations, there are numerous alternate, and often
neglected, sources of information on sensitive stories: court records like search warrant
returns; defense lawyers who shadow criminal investigation or their clients; congressional
oversight committees, witnesses before a grand jury who are not forbidden from talking
about their testimony, medical examiner reports, etc.
III.) KNOW THE RULES OF THE GAME AND DON'T WASTE CALLS TO LAW
ENFORCEMENT SOURCES WITH QUESTIONS LIKE “SO WHAT’S GOING ON?” The
key to getting high-level sources to talk is convincing them you understand the rules, law,
tactics and circumstances of a case and know what already is public. Nothing scares away
a source more than a reporter who is uninformed. Go to your best sources ONLY when
you know specifically what you need to ask and confirm. Show them you already have
significant information about the subject. Such professionalism establishes in sources’
minds you know your stuff and have talked to other people. That always increases their
comfort level about talking to you.
IV.) GROOM SOURCES LONG BEFORE YOU NEED THEM. When a big story breaks
and a source has to pick from hundreds of phone messages, familiarity breeds return calls.
Take the potentially useful sources out to lunch. Show up at their courthouse or police
station regularly and let them know you care about what their working on. Arrange to talk
to them over the phone on a regular pattern so they remember you interests. That's the
way you get your calls returned later when it counts on the big story.
V.) DON'T COVER COURT APPEARANCES AS PROCESS ONLY. Don't just focus on
the bail, arraignment and pleas. The criminal informations, motions, witness lists and
discovery requests are roadmaps to great law enforcement scoops. Check court files
during the time between scheduled appearances _ they usually are filled with new news
nuggets.
