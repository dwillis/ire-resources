Few beats are more emotional and politicized than crime, because behind all the policy debates lies a
great deal of human suffering. As reporters, we provide details on the crimes in our communities. How
do we also put those crimes into a meaningful context? How can we provoke public discussion about
policy choices that could make our society safer and more just? Crime reporting that goes beyond the
basic facts is a challenge, especially given that many journalists face constraints on time and space and
pressure to boost ratings and circulation. This resource guide is intended to help meet that challenge,
to help journalists in the trenches broaden the scope of their coverage.

Covering Criminal Justice,an updated and expanded version of last year's handbook of the same title,
is sponsored by The Center on Crime, Communities &Culture, a project of the Open Society Institute,
a private nonprofit grant-making and operating foundation founded by financier George Soros. The
Center works to h d public safety solutions that are practical, cost-effective, and humane. The guide
was conceived and executed in close cooperation with Columbia Journalism Review, the respected

bimonthly magazine that covers and critiques the press. Such a project cannot be comprehensive, and
we have surely omitted some players and perspectives. But we have attempted to provide a useful and
accurate resource guide for the working press. Both organizations welcome your feedback. The guide
is available both in print and online - on CJR'S site (www.
jr.org) and the Center's site (www.soros.

Despite the continual decline in the juvenile crime rate - a dramatic 11 percent between 1997 and
1998 - a series of high-profile crimes involving young people have lately dominated the juvenile justice agenda. Following last year's similar but smaller-scale tragedies in Oregon, Arkansas, and
Kentucky,April's devastating shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, had seismic
implications.
Not all of its reverberations were well covered. In 1999, Congress hotly debated (and ultimately
allowed to languish) a Juvenile Justice Bill. Juan Gonzalez, a columnist for the New York Daily News,
accurately observed that the news coverage of that legislation focused entirely on Congress's fight over
its gun-control measures. The bill's other very tough provisions were neglected. The bill would have
eliminated dozens of consent decrees ordering states to provide separate facilities for juvenile offenders, allowed federal prosecutors to try thirteen-year-olds as adults, and increased mandatory sentences
for juvenile offenders. Many in Congress argued that tough laws could prevent future tragedies like the
school shootings. In tun,youth advocates like the Justice Policy Institute's Vincent Schiraldi argued
that when children are jailed with adults, they are often subjected to brutality.
Though that debate got little press, post-Columbine reporting was regarded by many as an irnprovement over past juvenile crime coverage, because reporters attempted to analyze possible causes of the
killings and how similar tragedies might be prevented. Yet some observers, induding the editorial page
of the Washington, D.C., Afro-American, argue that the media pay more attention to issues l i e mental health and childhood trauma when young killers are white -.that they ask "why" when white suburban teenagers kill at Columbine High School, but accept gang shootings in urban black communities as inevitable.

A nationallyknown and respected expert on homicide, especidy among youth, as well as on serial murder,
workplace violence, capital punishment, and crime statistics. Like many of the best criminologists, Fox can't
be easily pegged as conservative or liberal. He argues that rising incarceration rates are a factor in the recent
decline in homicides in the U.S., and also cites the rising divorce rate, claiming it has brought down the
domestic homicide rate. He has urged tougher sentences for violent juveniles, but has also called for moderation in recent school violence-prevention measures (metal detectors, etc.). He opposes the death penalty,
arguing instead that killers should have to serve out their life sentences. Fox has sometimes helped the authorities catch serial killers, an avocation that has inspired a television movie. He is widely quoted by the media

referendum cracking down on gun shows, while Missouri voters rejected "conceal and carry" licenses, which
make it legal to carry a concealed weapon. Ohio and other states are considering "conceal and carry" laws.
Another controversy is whether gun manufacturers should be held liable for the public and personal
costs of gun violence. Twenty-eight cities and counties, including Chicago, Atlanta, and Newark, are
suing gun makers. Though the suits vary in their legal premises, all are intended to force the industry
to make its products safer, or less accessible to minors and criminals, or both. The suits have already
had a number of concrete effects. Many gun manufacturers have begun providing safety-lodung
devices with firearms; Smith & Wesson, a leading handgun manufacturer, now requires its dealers to
sign a code of ethics, promising to sell only guns with loch and not to sell guns to customers with
criminal records. Some industry groups have departed from the National Rifle Association's line and
have begun to make compromises in their positions on gun control, allowing some regulation of gun
sales to minors, for instance. On the other hand, there is a backlash: in July 1999, Louisiana passed legislation protecting gun manufacturers from gun-violence lawsuits.
Gun rights proponents differ among themselves on just how much to compromise with the gun control movement in debates over legislation. Similar debates divide gun control advocates. Some on the
gun control side contend that anything short of a total ban on all handguns is unacceptable, while others, like Handgun Control, Inc., favor small steps, like "One Gun a Month" laws, which restrict the
number of guns a consumer can buy within a designated period. As the issue becomes increasingly
central to politics, discussions about strategy and long-term goals will intensify.

According to the FBI, an average of eighteen hate crimes are committed every day in the U.S. More than half
of them are race-related; most of the rest are tied to religious or sexual orientation bias. Certainly hate crimes
are very much in the news. Last July, a twenty-one-year-old white supremacist shot and wounded six Jews
outside a Chicago synagogue; a month later, another gunman went on a shooting rampage at a Jewish community center in Los Angeles, then killed a mailman of Filipino ancestry because of the color of his skin.
Such crimes, and the publicity attached to them, have met with more cries for hate-crime legislation that
would toughen sentencing guidelines for those convicted of bias-related violence. Such measures are favored
by President Clinton and by many civil rights groups, including the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against
Defamation, whose members were galvanized by the brutal beating death of a gay Wyoming college student.
Within the past year, hate-crime legislation has been considered at both the federal and state levels.
Forty states have some kind of hate-crime law already on the books, but most states rejected attempts
in 1999 to expand such legislation or pass new laws. Advocates say that laws can makea powerful statement against hate and violence. But some critics, like Richard Kim, writing in The Nation,argue that
hate-crime laws are merely symbolic and do little to address the cultural roots of homophobic or racist
violence. Other commentators, like former New Republic editor Andrew Sullivan,point out the vagueness of the concept of hate, and the difficulty of defining its role in many crimes. Linda Chavez, formerly of the Reagan Administration, now of the Center for Equal Opportunity, argues that it would
be more effective to better enforce existing laws against violent crime.

Clear's current research emphasizes the community justice movement (also called "restorative justice," it
tries to offer crime victims a greater role in the justice system and help offenders make amends) and alternatives to incarceration. In collaboration with Dina Rose [see PRISONERSICORRECTIONS: INCARCERATION BOOM, p. 271, he also has been studying the impact of high levels of incarceration on cornmunities. His early work examined the effectiveness of traditional probation and parole, classification of
offenders, and treatment programs. He tends to argue that traditional U.S. approaches to crime have been
ineffective, and to favor research on new strategies.

In the past decade the number of incarcerated Americans has tripled, and will reach two million in the
year 2000. This is in part because politicians have interpreted the public's increasing concern about
violent crime as a cry for longer sentences, and passed laws ensuring longer prison terms. Are these
laws responsible for the current decrease in crime rates across the country?
Or have the laws' impact gone beyond what proponents intended? Prison populations are increasing
by a rate of about 12 percent a year, and it is nonviolent drug offenders who are swelling the ranks.
Between 1986 and 1996,the incarceration of women increased 900 percent. Less than a third of people now entering prison have been convicted of a violent crime.
Conservative policy analysts such as John DiIulio as well as liberals like Marc Mauer have been questioning the wisdom of filling prisons with nonviolent, low-level drug users. States such as North
Carolina, Michigan, Virginia, and Ohio have implemented "truth-in-sentencing" reforms, which
emphasize short or alternative sentences for nonviolent offenders while making early release of violent
felons more difficult. Public opinion research has repeatedly shown that most people, whatever their
politics, feel that violent criminals too often escape incarceration. At the same time, the University of
Cincinnati's Frank Cullen and other public opinion researchers have found that when people are aware
of alternatives to imprisonment for nonviolent offenders -drug treatment or community senrice, for
example - they tend to favor them.

"We're a desperate city," Mayor Larry Adarns told The Atlantic Monthly writer Eric Schlosser (December
1998), explaining why he wanted a prison built in California City, California. The town had been reeling
from recent layoffs at a nearby Air Force base. Throughout Virginia and West Virginia, prisons are bringing jobs and revenues to counties devastated by the decline of the coal industry. Prisons are big business,
and rural communities all over the country are finding them increasingly hard to turn down. In the economically depressed Adirondacks, in upstate New York, studies show that prisons bring in about $1,000
per resident per year in government money to the local economy, and year-round, recession-proof jobs.

Local media in these areas are finding the prison industry an increasinglyimportant beat, one that requires
investigation on many levels. What are the relationships between prison-builders and politicians? Who
profits most from these deals?Are prisons a wise long-term economic development strategy?What are the
effects of prison-building on other spending priorities? (A recent study by the Center on Juvenile and
Criminal Justice found that from 1987 to 1995, states' expenditures for prisons increased by 30 percent,
while public spending on universities dedined by 18 percent; such observations have raised concerns that
prisons are diverting funds from other public needs.) What are the long-term implications - for our
democracy, our workplaces, our neighborhoods, and our economy -when the incarcerated attempt to
re-enter society?And finally, does incarcerating this many people truly improve public safety?

In February 1999, New York City police officers shot an unarmed West AfXcan immigrant forty-one
times, The case horrified New York and the nation, and inspired public protests. A number of other
incidents of alleged police brutality in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles also drew national attention, as did New Jersey State Police officers' admissions that they engaged in racial profiling, a phenomenon more idiomatically known as stopping motorists for "Driving While Black." Such incidents
have highlighted the issue of police accountability.
Many black Americans say they feel that police regard them with a presumption of guilt. Some believe
that police officers are rarely held accountable, even for serious civil rights violations. Police officers
counter that excessive force is hardly the norm, and that so-called "proliling" only occurs because a disproportionate percentage of lawbreakers are black. Some say that erring on the aggressive side in stopping motorists has led, in their communities, to a reduction in crime.
Finding ways to bridge the gap between a community and its police officers is clearly a matter of urgent
public safety interest; neighborhood watches, civilian review boards, citizen watchdog groups, and
numerous experiments in "community policing" bear close reporting. In addition, legislation to
address racial profiling has been introduced in Congress as well as a number of states. Do these bills
have teeth? Are they wise? How will they fare after the din from the latest high-profile cases dies down?

National Criminal Justice Reference Service (below). Another good source of BJS data is The Sourcebook of
Criminal Justice Statistics, published annually, available on the Web at www.albany.edulsourcebook. The
BJS compiles the National Crime Victimization Survey Report, which unlike the FBI reports relies on
household interviews rather than police reports. Thus it tends to be a good source on unreported crime,
though since interviews aren't private, it tends to under-report domestic abuse. And since people are
reporting on their own victimization, murder and kidnapping are obviously left out.

At present, 1.4 million black citizens cannot vote because of laws that bar convicted felons from voting. If
current rates of incarceration continue, 30 percent to 40 percent of all black men could be disenfranchised,
according to the Sentencing Project, a sentencing-reform organization. Is our criminal justice system
racially biased, implicitly or explicitly?If so, what can be done? Is public fear about crime often an expression of racial fears? Do some groups in our society commit more crimes than other groups? If so, why?
Race is one of the most sensitive aspects of the public debate on crime. It forces us to ask whether our

justice system is fair. Clearly, from a statistical approach, a citizen's relationship to the criminal justice
system is heavily influenced by his or her race. The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that blacks' rate
of imprisonment exceeds that of whites by seven to one. Whether this disparity results from a disproportionate percentage of crime by black people, from discriminatory sentencing, from disparities in
quality of counsel, or from something as fundamental as economic disadvantage among b l a h , or
some combination of these factors, is open to debate. But these questions pervade nearly every aspect
of criminal justice policy.

V I O L E N C E AS A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE
For nearly two decades, the medical and scientific communities have treated violence, especially gun
violence, as they might treat any other epidemic. They identlfy risk factors -poverty, alcoholism, drug
addiction, availability of guns - and seek to prevent injuries and deaths by addressing root causes.
Hundreds of public and private violence prevention projects have emerged, but the policy world and
the public have remained relatively isolated from these developments, continuing to view crime primarily kom a law enforcement perspective.
Reporting on crime as a public health issue -drawing on medical and health professionals as sources,
and conducting regular status reports on patterns of violence within different communities - tends
to suggest solutions such as drug treatment, community economic development, and improved services for the mentally ill. Focusing on the public health angle may also help move the crime debate
beyond "hard/soft" questions and allow journalists to frame crime not simply as a nightly series of
kightening incidents, but in terms of patterns and solutions.

Much was made of the Columbine school killers' obsession with violent video games. Dave Grossman, a
retired Army lieutenant and author of the just-published Stop Teaching Our Kids to Kdl, has argued that
video games desensitize children to murderous violence in ways that are strikingly similar to Army training. But recent studies, one at Purdue University, another by Mediascope,a media watchdog organization,
have found little concrete evidence linking the playing of such games to violent behavior.
New York University cultural critic Neil Postman argues that there is so much media violence it hardly
makes sense to single out video games. For years, people from all points in the political spectrum, from the
Christian Coalition to the Center for Media Education, have been calling for less violence on television and
in movies. And Boston-area education professors Nancy Carhon-Paige and Diane Levin, writing recently in The Christian ScienceMonitor, called for greater attention to the impact of violent toys.
But it is difficult to measure the contribution of cultural products to violent behavior. Does violent
television produce violent children? Or does a violent society produce both? Meanwhile, if indeed television and cultural products are to be regulated, how can such regulation be reconciled with free
expression? Or with powerful entertainment industry interests?
