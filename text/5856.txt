Google Alerts
Once you’re signed into your Google account, you can set up Google Alerts here:
https://www.google.com/alerts
Tip |​ W
​ e recommend you use Google alerts with your personal Gmail account. This way, if
you leave the company you still have the alerts.

Tip |​ Please note that any alerts you set up are saved in your Google account - while re
recommend setting up alerts for information such as your phone number or physical address,
we do not recommend setting up alerts for particularly sensitive information, such as your
Social Security Number.

Public Record/People Aggregator
There are hundreds of people aggregator sites out there - many large sites “feed” smaller sites,
making them a good starting point for significantly decreasing your online footprint. ​Below is a
short list of sites that we recommend starting with​. Once you’ve tackled those sites, within a
few weeks the amount of your personal data across people aggregator sites will significantly
decrease.

See if you can find profiles of yourself on these sites and consider taking steps to opt out.
Please note that some of these sites will request you provide some personal data to opt out,
such as email address, phone number, and address. Here are some tips for this:
● Create a seperate, “burner” email address to use for opting out. If you already have one,
just use that.
● Set up a virtual phone number, like ​Google Voice​ or ​Sudo​.
● Only provide sites with data they already have about you. If you see that they have an
old home address, do not provide them with a current address, just provide them with
the address they already have listed for verification.
● Don’t EVER​ provide a copy of any documents, such as a driver’s license or passport.

handle is being used. This can help you discover old accounts you may have set up, as
well as keep an eye for impersonation accounts

authentication. This is a more secure method and prevents from attacks such as
SIM hijacking​.
