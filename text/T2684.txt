Reporting on Federally-Funded Transportation Projects
Presentation by David Barnes
Communications Director
U.S. DOT Office of Inspector General
As Prepared for Delivery
June 16, 2006

Good morning and welcome to Fort Worth. My name is David Barnes and I am the
communications director for the Office of Inspector General at the U.S. Department of
Transportation. I am also an associate member of IRE and a former journalist for daily
newspapers in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, as well as for two national transportation trade
publications. This is the ninth national or regional IRE conference I’ve attended since 1988.
I’m going to start my presentation with a statistic. $40 billion. That’s how much the federal
government sends to state and local governments each year for building, maintaining and
expanding roads, highways, bridges, and transit systems.
The job of the DOT-OIG is to help make sure that federal transportation funds are used as
intended and not lining the pocket of crooked contractors or spent unnecessarily.
How do we do that? DOT OIG provide oversight of federally-funded transportation projects
through: 1) joint investigations with other oversight agencies; 2) educating state and local
governments, industry, and the media, about how to detect fraud; and 3) auditing individual
projects and federal oversight programs.
Over the next few minutes, I’m going offer some suggestions on what to look for and some
questions to ask when covering federally-funded highway and transit projects. Much of what I
will talk about comes from presentations given at OIG’s recent fraud prevention conference.
More than 300 auditors, investigators and program managers and industry representatives from
around the country gathered in Orlando to share the latest developments, tools, and ideas for
fighting fraud. If you would like copies of the presentations, please contact me.
But first, a little bit about the DOT OIG.
THE ROLE OF INSPECTORS GENERAL
IGs were created by Congress in 1978 to consolidate federal audit and criminal investigation
functions. Cabinet-level IGs are appointed by the President and are subject to confirmation by the
Senate.
Federal IGs serve at the pleasure of the President. Unlike Cabinet secretaries and other
presidentially appointed officials, however, if the President wants to fire an IG, he must send a
letter of explanation to the Congress. That gives IGs a measure of independence.
The role of the IG is unique in the federal government. IGs report both to the agency head and to
Congress. The role of the IG varies somewhat among the agencies, but the statutory authorities
and responsibilities generally include detecting and preventing fraud, waste and abuse and
evaluating program operations and management systems and recommending solutions or
improvements.

It is important to note that IGs do not have the ability to force agencies to take action. Like the
National Transportation Safety Board, we can make recommendations, but it is up to the
Secretary and the agency heads - sometimes with the prodding of Congress - to take action.
IGs also report to the Congress. Members of Congress can, and frequently request that IGs audit a
particular program or investigate an issue. We try to be responsive to congressional requests.

OIG AND THE MEDIA
Before I explain how OIG works, let me explain our media policy. Our first responsibility is to
the Congress and the Department. We do not aggressively seek media attention, nor do we shun
it. Our goal is to help the media understand our reports, so we are happy to explain technical
issues cited in our work
When a report is publicly released, we post it on our website, which is www.oig.dot.gov. We also
distribute reports via email to interested media. Let me know if you wish to be added to our
distribution list. My email is david.barnes@oig.dot.gov.
Here are a few things you should know:

We don’t leak advance copies of reports. Because we give our reports to Congress before
making them public, they occasionally get into print or on air before they are posted on our
website.
We limit our comments to explaining what is in the report. If it’s not in the report, we don’t
talk about it.
We don’t speculate on what actions Congress or the Department may take in response to our
work.
We are required to abide by Justice Department regulations on investigative matters.

OIG STRUCTURE
DOT OIG has a staff of about 430 people with which to oversee a Department of nearly 60,000
people and an annual budget of about $58 billion.
DOT OIG is broken down into divisions handling audits and investigations.
We have a staff of about 230 auditors and analysts who review DOT programs and make
recommendations to enhance their effectiveness and improve their efficiency. Some audits focus
on financial issues; others provide oversight of safety programs, contract management, computer
security and program performance. OIG audits must follow government audit standards
established by the Government Accountability Office. GAO just posted the newly-revised
standards on their website last week. (www.gao.gov)
We also have 100 criminal investigators who have federal law enforcement authority to carry
firearms, obtain subpoenas and search warrants and make arrests. In addition to contract and grant
fraud, our investigative priorities include transportation safety and enforcement of Federal
hazardous materials transportation laws. Our employee integrity unit investigates allegations of
ethical lapses or violations of law by DOT employees.

OIG also maintains a confidential Hotline to facilitate the reporting of allegations of fraud, waste,
abuse, or mismanagement in DOT or DOT-funded programs. Allegations may be reported by
DOT employees, contractors, or the general public. The toll-free Hotline number is 1-800-4249071.
Our investigations can result in a variety of actions. We can refer a case to the agency or
Department for administrative action, or we can seek civil or criminal charges.
As I said previously, we are required to abide by Justice Department regulations regarding
relations with the news media on investigative matters. In general, we neither confirm nor deny
the existence of an investigation unless there is some sort of public activity, such as executing a
search warrant or making an arrest.
OIG’S CONTRACT AND GRANT FRAUD INITIATIVE
While fighting fraud has always been the “bread and butter” of IGs, DOT-OIG stepped up its
oversight following the 1998 passage of surface transportation legislation authorizing a record
$218 billion in highway and transit spending over six years. Las summer, Congress reauthorized
the highway and transit programs at a funding level of $286 billion.
How many of you remember “Slick Willie?” That was the nickname of Depression-era bank
robber Willie Sutton. When asked why he robbed banks, Sutton simply replied, "Because that's
where the money is." History shows that when large sums of money are spent, the opportunity
for fraud increases.
$286 billion sounds like a lot of money, but consider this:
1. The Interstate Highway System turns 50 this year, qualifying it for AARP membership,
yet the volume of traffic it carries continues to increase;
2. Freight traffic, which puts the greatest burden on highways, is expected to double over
the next 15 years.
3. According to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials,
the amount of money needed to maintain the nation’s highway and transit systems far
exceeds available resources.
In that context, every dollar saved through improved oversight or recovered from wrongdoers is a
dollar more that can go to fixing potholes.
Since our anti-fraud initiative began in 1998, OIG has obtained 398 indictments, 315 convictions,
and financial recoveries of $179,852,999. OIG currently has 227 contract and grant fraud
investigations open in 43 states and U.S. territories.
At OIG’s fraud prevention conference in April, OIG investigators discussed over a dozen recent
cases illustrating common contract and grant fraud schemes, such as:
o
o
o

bid-rigging;
false claims; and
fraud in the DBE program.

Here are a few highlights from the conference.
Bid-Rigging
In January 2004, executives of two paving companies were charged with rigging bids on over
$100 million in Wisconsin DOT contracts. The contractors would meet in parking lots and
elsewhere before submitting bids for state contracts, decide who would get which contracts and
exchange bid prices. Unfortunately for them, they included a third person – a manager at another
paving company in their wheeling and dealing.
The manager’s bosses became suspicious when he kept asking for bid information on contracts he
was not involved in. After being confronted by federal agents, the contractor wore a wire for a
year to help build a case. The two contractors eventually pleaded guilty and paid fines and
restitution exceeding $3 million.
In building their case, OIG and FBI investigators examined bid histories to see if the same
companies won contracts in the same region. They also looked for similarities in bids. The
corrupt contractors were lazy and often cut and pasted portions of each other’s contracts, virtually
line for line. In some cases, there were even identical misspelled words.
An interesting sidebar to this case. During the investigation, two of the companies were
suspended by the state of Wisconsin from working on state-funded contracts. Because the
companies were among the largest in the state, many communities decided to let them continue
working on locally-funded projects. You may want to check whether your state or community
allows companies charged with or convicted of fraud from bidding on contracts.
Since municipal, county and state contracts are often the bread and butter of paving firms, a
strong suspension and debarment policy is a powerful deterrent to fraud. I will talk more about
suspension and debarment in a moment.
False Claims
Another common type of fraud is false claims, such as submitting bills for goods or services that
weren’t provided. OIG investigated a Delaware case in which a consulting engineer submitted
bills requesting payment for testing that was never done. The company also claimed it used a
certified inspector to examine welds when in fact the inspectors were not certified. We checked
the names of the inspectors who did the work with the American Welding Society, which certifies
welders.
Labor Mischarging
Federal law requires that contractors working on federally-funded projects pay prevailing local
wages and certify that it is doing so. In the case of Minnesota Valley Landscaping, the familyowned company was prime contractor on $4.7 million in contracts with the Minnesota DOT
between 1998 and 2003. The company underpaid employees and lied on its certified payroll
records.
Fraud in the DBE Program
The Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program requires state and local agencies that receive
DOT financial assistance to establish goals for the participation of minority and women-owned
small businesses and certify the eligibility of DBE firms to participate in DOT-assisted projects.

In part because of OIG’s increased emphasis on contract fraud, the number of DBE cases we get
involved in is increasing.
Between 1996 and 2000, OIG opened 15 DBE fraud cases, resulting in 22 indictments, 12
convictions and $630,200 in fines and recoveries.
That figure has nearly quadrupled over the past five years. Between 2001 and 2005, we opened
81 DBE fraud cases resulting in 56 indictments, 44 convictions and $13,306,707 in fines and
restitution
As of April, OIG had 49 DBE cases open in 20 states.
Here’s a Texas example of a recent case OIG investigated involving the DBE program.
In December, Williams Brothers Construction Co., Inc., of Houston agreed to pay $3 million to
resolve claims that it violated DBE program contracting requirements. The company used two
concrete-supply DBE companies it controlled and claimed DBE contracting credit for equipment
lease expenses incurred by the subcontractors for equipment actually owned by an affiliate of the
companies. The Federal Highway Administration deserves a lot of credit for pursuing this case
after it was declined for criminal prosecution by the Justice Department.
SUSPENSION AND DEBARMENT
As I mentioned earlier, preventing contractors from obtaining government contracts is a powerful
tool in combating fraud. Last summer, the Department of Transportation strengthened its
suspension and debarment order. Operating Administrations must either initiate suspension or
debarment proceedings or explicitly justify why such companies or individuals should continue to
do business with the federal government.
To find out if a company has been suspended or debarred from doing business with the federal
government, check out the federal excluded parties list, http://www.epls.gov/.
DOT OIG is working with state and local officials to populate a website containing information
on state and local debarments. The Transportation Oversight Providers Network, or TOPNet was
developed by OIG as a tool for sharing and enhancing interagency communications aimed at
strengthening oversight. You can find TOPNet at www.topnet.gov.
OIG AUDIT ACTIVITY
The last area I would like to touch on is OIG’s oversight of highway and transit projects and
programs. Since 1999, OIG has conducted audits of 20 major highway and transit projects
ranging from the Central Artery Project in Boston to the Tren Urbano subway system in San
Juan. We also testified five times before Congress during the reauthorization of the federal-aid
highway and transit programs.
Whether funds are lost to cost overruns, schedule delays or fraud, the result is the same - fewer
resources are available for important transportation projects. Here are some things to keep an eye
on as you cover transportation projects.
Cost increases and schedule slippages: If the price starts going up on a road, bridge or transit
project, pay attention. In 2002, we reported that unanticipated cost increases on the “Mixing
Bowl” interchange outside Washington, DC forced the state of Virginia to cut spending on

5

projects elsewhere in the state. You can monitor cost increases on major projects through their
annual finance plan updates. The handout lists other documents that will help you track cost and
schedule.
State Transportation Improvement Plans: How does your state plan on paying for the projects
in its short and long-term transportation plans? New Jersey ran into some difficulties last fall
when the Federal Highway Administration warned that it would not approve the state’s 2006-08
State Transportation Improvement Plan because the state’s Transportation Trust Fund was
nearing insolvency and state officials couldn’t demonstrate it would be able to meet its
obligations. FHWA eventually approved the plan after the state reauthorized the trust fund.
Finance Plans: Congress gave FHWA some new management tools last year. Major projects those expected to cost more than $500 million - must submit a project management plan and an
annual finance plan to FHWA. Previously, only those projects costing in excess of $1 billion
were required to file detailed plans with the Feds. The other major change is for projects with an
estimated total cost of $100 million or more. They now must prepare an annual financial plan.
Unobligated Funds: Sometimes projects cost less than anticipated. Ever wonder what happens to
the leftover money? In a report issued last November, we found that 14 states were holding $258
million in unneeded federal funds for highway projects that had not seen any activity for at least a
year. We projected that as much as $500 million more might be sitting idle in other states. To its
credit, FHWA acted upon our recommendation to work with the states to identify projects where
there had been no activity for a year or more, whether because projects had been completed,
canceled, or reduced in scope. As a result, states identified $757 million that could be freed up
and spent on other projects. FHWA is putting a system in place to routinely release unneeded
funds.
Oil Prices: One final area to keep an eye on is the high oil prices and the resulting impact it is
having on road construction costs. A June 8 story in the Boston Globe stated that “the soaring cost
of petroleum – a primary ingredient of asphalt – has forced many communities to shoulder a 50
percent increase in costs as crews head out to repave roads this summer.” The AP reported in May
that prices for heavy highway construction materials products such as asphalt, concrete and steel
increased about 12 percent last year and 7.5 percent in 2004 in Ohio. Though the higher costs
will have little effect on current ODOT projects, the state says it might have to delay some major
work scheduled over the next four years.
I’ve hit a lot of topics in a short period of time. The handout at the back of the room contains
more information. If you think of something you want to ask me when you get home, or want
copies of the presentations from the fraud prevention conference, email me at
david.barnes@oig.dot.gov.
And if you write any stories on contract and grant fraud, please forward them to me. News reports
have resulted in audits and investigations being initiated.
