Answer Key (page 9)

Getting Started
 Go to the main IPUMS-USA site. Click "Select Data" and use the drop down menus

(household – economic characteristics) or search function to find the variables you are
interested in.

o

Find the household variable OWNERSHP

o

Click on the variable name to get to the variable page

 Once on the OWNERSHP variable page, look at the variable description tab. The

description describes the variable.

 Look at the Comparability tab. This tab discusses any issues with comparing the

variable over time.

 What is the universe for OWNERSHP – in other words, which respondents or

households are asked this question?

 For what years is this variable NOT available?

Basic Frequencies
In a new tab, go to http://usa.ipums.org/usa/sda/, and select the 2012 ACS sample. Log
in. Enter OWNERSHP in the "Row" field.
Now we need to select a filter. Selection filters allow you to analyze specific cases.
Here, the code values should be in parentheses.

1) Go back and look at the Universe tab for OWNERSHP on the IPUMS website. What
does the universe suggest about what filter(s) should be used for making tables using
OWNERSHP?

2) In what percentage of households in the IPUMS 2012 ACS sample was the housing
unit owned by a member of that household?

3) In 2) we have the percentage of households in the 2012 ACS sample that were owned
by members of that household. However, we are really interested in percentage of all
U.S. households that own their housing unit in 2012. To get this statistic, we need to
apply the household weight (HHWT).

What percentage of households in the U.S. owned their housing unit (i.e. did not rent) in
2012?

4) How does this percentage differ from the un-weighted percentage? Does the sample
over- or under-represent American home-owning households in 2012?

5) Suppose instead of the proportion of households that were owned you wanted to know
the proportion of people living in households that own their housing units. For this we
would need the person weight (perwt).

What percentage of people in the U.S. lived in a household that was owned by a resident
of that housing unit in 2012?

6) Return to the sample selection screen at http://usa.ipums.org/usa/sda/ and select 2010
ACS.
How do rates of U.S. homeownership (that is, households in the U.S. that owned their
housing unit) in 2012 compare to homeownership rates in 2010?

Crosstabs
7) What relationship do you see between homeownership rates (that is, percentage of
households in the U.S. that owned their housing unit) and education level of the
household head in 2010?

8) How do rates of homeownership vary among states in 2010? Look specifically at the
difference in ownership rates between New York and North Dakota.

9)Return to the IPUMS-USA web page and find the codes for the variable METAREA.
Find the codes for New York, Minneapolis-St. Paul and Yuma.
What are the differences in rates of ownership among these three metropolitan areas?

10) Compare the confidence intervals for each metro area. How and why are they
different?

Recoding Variables
11) How do rates of homeownership compare across occupation in 2010?
There are far too many rows in this table to be useful. In order to make the table more
manageable, we are going to recode all of the occupation codes into just a few categories.
Return to the IPUMS-USA website and find the codes for occ1950. Notice the headings
in all caps on the codes page. These headings are going to be our new occupation
categories. This recode/collapse is done in the "Row" field on the SDA page.
In the "Row" field, enter occ1950(r: 0000-200 "Managerial and professional Specialty
occupations"; 203-389 "Technical, Sales, and Administrative Support"; 405-469 "Service
Occupations"; 473-498 "Farming, forestry, fishing"; 503-699"Production, Craft, Repair"; 703889"Operators, Fabricators, Laborers"; 905 "Military"; 991-999 "Unemployed, NA")
12) What relationships between occupation and homeownership in 2010 can you observe from the new
table?

13) Follow the same procedure to make a table using OWNERSHP and AGE variables.
What relationship do you observe between age and homeownership in 2010?

Making a Table
14) Transfer the table from the SDA query interface in your web browser to an Excel
worksheet using the Firefox with Table2Clipboard installed.
a) Right click on the table entitled "Frequency Distribution" and choose Table2Clipboard
-> Copy whole table
b) Open a blank Excel worksheet, and select the first cell. Use the "Match destination
formatting" option under Paste
c) If the numbers show up as a string of pound signs in the spreadsheet,
select the columns in question, right click and select "Column width…"
Change the column width to 15
d) Format the table for readability.
1. Include a proper title
2. Make sure labels are properly aligned with the rows and columns.
3. Make sure all percentages are displaying the same number of
decimal places

4. Include the source
5. Remove Ns from the table
6. Include unweighted Ns at the bottom of the table
(this will require running another table in the SDA window with the
weights off)

7. In the View menu, uncheck the box next to "Gridlines." The table
can now be easily copied and pasted into a Word document

ANSWER KEY
1) Go back and look at the Universe tab for OWNERSHP on the IPUMS website. What
does the universe suggest about what filter(s) should be used for making tables using
OWNERSHP?
Those living in group quarters are not asked about homeownership. We want to filter
out all vacant units and group quarters. The values 1-2 for the variable GQ identify
non-vacant, non-group quarters housing units. Our filter should be gq(1-2).

2) In what percentage of households in the IPUMS 2012 ACS sample was the housing
unit owned by a member of that household?
70.1%
3) What percentage of households in the U.S. owned their housing unit (i.e. did not rent)
in 2012?
64%
4) How does this percentage differ from the un-weighted percentage? Does the sample
over- or under-represent American home-owning households in 2012?
The percentage of households in which the housing unit was owned by an
occupying member in 2012 was higher in the ACS sample than it was for the entire
U.S. Home-owning households are over represented in the 2012 ACS sample.
5) What percentage of people in the U.S. lived in a household that was owned by a
resident of that housing unit in 2012?
65.5%

6) How do rates of U.S. homeownership (that is, households in the U.S. that owned their
housing unit) in 2012 compare to homeownership rates in 2010?
There is a slight decrease in the percentage of home-owning households between
2010 and 2012.
7) What relationship do you see between homeownership rates (that is, percentage of
households in the U.S. that owned their housing unit) and education level of the
household head in 2010?
Households where the head had 2 or more years of college education owned their
housing unit at higher rates than those with less than 2 years of college education.
8) How do rates of homeownership (that is, percentage of households in the U.S. that
owned their housing unit) vary among states in 2010? Look specifically at the difference
in ownership rates between New York and North Dakota.
The percentage of homes owned in North Dakota is higher than the percentage of
homes owned in New York.
9) What are the differences in rates of ownership among these three metropolitan areas?
Again, New York metro area rates of home ownership are much lower than in
Minneapolis/St Paul and Yuma.
10) Compare the confidence intervals for each metro area. How and why are they
different?
The confidence intervals around the Yuma estimates are much larger than those
around the New York and Minneapolis estimates. This is because of the small
sample size in the Yuma metro area. If you run the table without the weight, you
will see that there are 661 households total in Yuma in the 2010 ACS sample.
11) How do rates of homeownership compare across occupation in 2010?
This table is far too large to be useable.
12) What relationships between occupation and homeownership in 2010 can you observe from the new
table?

Rates of homeownership the highest for people in managerial occupations.
13) Follow the same procedure to make a table using OWNERSHP and AGE variables.
What relationship do you observe between age and homeownership in 2010?
Possible recode: age(r: 15-25 "15-25"; 26-35 " 26-35"; 36-45 "36-45"; 46-55 "4655"; 56-65 "56-65"; 66-75 "66-75"; 76-* "76+")
Rates of homeownership are lower for younger people, especially in their 20s than
older adults.
