Failures of Enforcement – IRE 2016
Howard Berkes – NPR Investigations
1. THEY SAY THEY’RE ENFORCING – MAKE THEM PROVE IT


Seek records of enforcement actions, including investigative reports, citations, incident or
accident reports, civil or criminal complaints, administrative complaints, lawsuits



Seek their data. How do they track what they’re doing? How do they measure their own
performance/effectiveness/efficiency? What’s their paper trail?



Who is watching them? Seek reports, audits and investigations conducted by Inspectors
General, the Government Accountability Office, congressional committees, internal affairs



What’s the actual record? How often do they act? How much do they do? Do violators get
breaks – reduced penalties, settlements, plea agreements – and how much and how often?
Does the agency collect penalties, go to court, file complaints – and how often?



Are rulings, fines, citations, sanctions and judgments enforced?



What data do they use? What data do they not use? What different sets of data do they
fail to associate?



How do they frame their role and how does that limit their scope, focus, approach and
effectiveness?



Who do they interview? Who don’t they interview?



What multiple levels of authority do they have? Do they exercise all the authority they
have?



What data and documents should they have but don’t?



What laws/regulations do they enforce? What don’t they enforce? What’s holding them
back?

2. GET HELP


Find “guides” to the regulatory landscape, complexities, nuances, history, jargon, practices
and data



Find former agency investigators, regulators, inspectors, watchdogs, lawyers and officials



Who does the agency interact with (other agencies, commissions, academics, industry
experts, critics, whistleblowers, watchdogs, lawmakers)

3. WHAT’S THE CONSEQUENCE?


What are the regulated able to get away with? Who benefits and how?



What’s the compliance record? More violations? More injuries? Greater risk?



Who is left unprotected or exposed? Who gets hurt?



What do law and regulations fail to do? Where are the gaps?



What legislation/regulations are pending?

4. WHO CARES? WHAT COULD BE DONE?


What do lawmakers/watchdogs/activists think?



What do top agency officials say?



Who has official oversight and how are they reacting?



Who is and isn’t demanding action and why?

5. HUMANIZE THE DATA AND DOCUMENTS


Measure the human toll



Illustrate the data, and trends in the data, with real world experiences



Consult complaints, cases, lawsuits, attorneys, activists, interest groups, public/legislative
hearings, news stories, agency clients



Verify the claims of the affected (seek and review medical records, legal filings, official
reports, witness statements, contemporaneous notes, recordings, documents, e-mails, etc.)

6. ENGAGE THE TARGET


Share data, methods and findings as part of your reporting
