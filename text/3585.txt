Secrecy Inspires Project
The U.S. Congress eight years ago did
something it rarely had done before:
exempted from the Freedom of
Information Act a database that traced
guns used in crimes back to dealers.

Rep. Todd Tiahrt (R-Kan.),
primary sponsor of provision

The Blackout
• The Tiahrt Amendment silenced media
investigations into gun stores, firearms
trafficking and crime trends
• Assignment from our editor Jeff Leen:

Break the secrecy

How We Broke the Secrecy
• Assembled a database of 35,000+ guns traced to
crimes from state and local databases in Maryland,
Virginia and the District of Columbia.
• Compiled a list of 511 police officers killed by
firearms and traced 30 cop-killer weapons.
• Obtained lists of the top 12 gun dealers in the past
two years who have sold the most weapons traced
from Mexican crime scenes

What is a Gun Trace?
• Police seize a gun in a crime investigation, ask
ATF to ID dealer who first sold the gun.
• Guns leave a paper trail. Guns sold by dealers
require an ATF form “4473.”
• Buyer, when and where.
• Traces can crack criminal cases.
• Examined over time, identify trafficking patterns.

ATF Trace
• Gun seized
after robbery in
Portsmouth,
Va. Gun
bought by a
man about six
months before
he pulled the
holdup.

What the data showed
• In 1990s, researchers calculated: 57 percent of
guns traced to crimes nationwide sold by roughly
1 percent of the dealers (80,000+ dealers)
• Data used to identify corrupt dealers.
• ATF cracks down on dealers, found problems
(missing guns, etc).
• Dealers angry, turn to NRA and Congress
• Leads to Tiahrt BLACKOUT

Asking police to share trace data
• Asked sources nationally and regionally
• Difficult but not impossible
• Many declined; some said (erroneously)
they couldn’t … politics of doing so
(pressure from ATF)
• Tiahrt Amendment chills local police;
dummy up on gun traces

Does the data exist elsewhere?

• Former Post data editor Sarah Cohen told Fallis about a
database called the “Virginia Criminal Firearms
Clearinghouse”
– Requires police in Virginia to report guns seized
– Dozens of fields of information, including traces

Bingo! More than 100,000 guns
• Largely unused and unanalyzed
• Multiple Open records act requests
• Clean, parse, standardize
• About 1/4 to 1/3 of guns had usable trace info
• Like ATF data, most guns from few dealers
• < 1 percent of dealers sold 60% of crime guns
• Not explained away by volume.

What about DC & Maryland?
• Virginia’s Criminal Firearms Clearinghouse probably is
unique in the USA
• No Maryland or DC criminal firearms database
• Sarah Cohen comes to the rescue again: Maryland does
track sales of handguns and assault weapons logged in
Maryland Automated Firearms System
• Sales of guns in DC are essentially illegal (Heller v DC)
• Requested database and got 500,000+ guns sold by
licensed dealers since 1990
• But – these are just sales; not crime gun database
• If we could get guns seized in crimes, we could compare
them to the Maryland database

Seized Gun Data
• After seizing guns, police test fire, analyze and log data
• FOIA’d unpublicized databases from DC and PG Firearms
Exams Units.

PG Firearms
Examination logs

Realco:
Where DC crooks go to buy guns
- 2,500 guns traced to Realco
- The next biggest, active dealer had 600.

Day One

D & R Arms in Portsmouth, Va.
Time-to-Crime
•
•
•
•

More traces than 3,400 shops in Virginia since 1998.
Average Time from gun sale to seizure in a crime scene (Time to
Crime) a little more than one year.
Almost 70 % of guns traced, sold < a year, some days and weeks
Police and court documents on 200 cases

Trafficking to Mexico

• 30,000 deaths in Mexican drug wars
• 9 of 10 guns from U.S. stores – ATF
• Set out to get the top gun dealers

Getting the Mexico List
• Obtained list from sources
• Scoured lawsuits in Pacer for ATF and US
attorney cases, civil litigation, torts
• Top store: Carter’s Country in Houston had
frightening track record
– Cop killed by gun obtained in straw purchase
– Allegations by former employe

The National List

• Once we had the list we did a full backgrounder
on the FFL (federal firearm licensee) looking for
corporation status, lawsuits, contact info – and we
called them.

How We Found the Adverse
Action Database
•

•

•

License revocations are rare. Of
60,000 licenses, about 100 are
revoked annually. So David
Fallis asked: What does it take to
revoke a license?
An IG report on the ATF
criticized failure to accurately
track enforcement, revocations
ATF’s response to IG report:
– “The ATF [is]... developing
and monitoring an improved
adverse action tracking
system for denials and
revocations of licenses.”

Revolving Licenses
• Compared stores that had had licenses revoked to
databases of currently licensed stores
• Revoked shops were still open. Mentioned in Day One and
last wave of series.
• Embattled shops frequently secured new licenses through
family members or associates.
– Husband to wife
– Mother to son,
– Brother to brother.

NRA Lobbying

The NRA in the past two decades has spent more than
$100 million on political activities in the United States,
according to documents and interviews, including $22
million on lobbying and nearly $75 million on
campaigns.
