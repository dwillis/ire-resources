Legal Documents
What to try before you buy (federal court documents,
that is)
When you want to see what’s out there:
● Justia: Free search/metadata
When you’re looking for a specific case:
● Check RECAP!

RECAP
● RECAP is an online archive of federal court documents, built by PACER users.
● Two ways to use RECAP:
○ Search their database yourself
○ Install the browser extension
■ PACER’s browser extension lets you see which documents are available for
free in the archive while you’re searching PACER itself.
■ Auto archives any docs you purchase

RECAP is extremely hit or miss. You may be the only
person interested in documents from a particular
case.
