Tips for using data to cover immigration
IRE 2019
What’s happening south of the border? While Customs and Border Protection stats, especially
when it comes to families, are limited, you may be able to request additional data from the
Mexican and Central American governments or tap into resources already available.

You can also use it to search for documents that have already been released and get
ideas of what you can request.
You can also download the entire database of every federal public information request
made by year. One of the fields is a link to the response:

It includes a lot of data about deportations and general facts for each country. You can also
reach out to them directly if you need additional information not provided on their website.
I was also told they are working on a Plataforma Regional de Información sobre Migración
(PRIMI) to be released in August (2019).
How to request raw data from CBP and ICE?
-

Ask for blank forms of things like arrest records, incident reports, drug seizures (e.g.: I826 Notice of Rights and Request for Disposition, I-867B Record of Sworn Statement, I867A Record of Sworn Statement_A)…

-

Check FOIA library (ICE, CBP, HHS), and logs to see what’s already out there, how
was the data requested? How did they release it?
Fortunately, TRAC from Syracuse University is already doing a lot of this work, what’s
the latest they’ve released, what are they getting, anything you can localize? Their paid
subscription offer a lot more options if your media outlet can afford to make the
investment.

Here are a couple of examples:
Raw apprehension data from the Border Patrol
Request:

I hereby request case-by-case data on Border Patrol apprehensions in the Tucson and
Yuma sectors for FY2015, FY2016 and FY2017YTD to include the following: * Incident
ID/Subject ID * Apprehension date * Sector * Citizenship * Gender * Age * Number of
children the individual apprehended reported and nationality of children * Marital
status * DHS status * Age at time of apprehension * Whether or not the individual was
referred for prosecution * Disposition * Number of times previously apprehended *
Status at entry * Consequence Delivery System Program the individual was processed
through * Arrest method. I can accept this in any ASCII text format, preferably as a .csv
file.
What they provided:

*Note: This was the first time they redacted the number of children and nationality. Before it
seemed that field was used to report number of children the adult was claiming and not
necessarily the number of children with them.

TRAC started requesting this same information and making it easy to digest here:
https://trac.syr.edu/phptools/immigration/cbparrest/
Raw data of smugglers arrest by the Office of Field Operations:
Request: I hearby request case-by-case data on Office of Field Operations arrests of

smugglers broken down by field office and year from fiscal years 2010 through 2015
to include the following: * Incident ID/Subject ID *Apprehension date *Sector *
Name * Gender * Age * Citizenship * City and state of residence * Whether it was
people or drug smuggling * DHS Status * Whether or not the individual was referred
for prosecution * Whether or not individual was accepted for prosecution *
Disposition * Sentence (If applicable) * Number of times previously apprehended *
Status at entry * Consequence Delivery System Program used to process individual (if
applicable) * Arrest method * Narrative/summary of incident. I can accept this in any
ASCII text format, preferably as a .csv file.
What they released:

Think of other local and state agencies you can get data from …
Medical examiners: Depending on the county, the data they keep about migrant deaths will
vary greatly. Pima County is a great example of very thorough data and very accessible:

Local law enforcement. Remember, that even in places that call themselves sanctuary, they
receive federal grants that have some immigration requirements. There are others that have
state laws that require them to be more involved in immigration enforcement or that
participate in programs such as 287(g).

Request call logs and incident reports where, for instance, a local officer assisted a
federal agency (agency assist); that includes key words such as “illegal immigrant,”
“UIA” (undocumented illegal alien), ask if they use a UCR code for calls involving
immigration to make your own database.
In some places, such as Arizona’s Department of Public Safety or the Tucson Police
Department, officers are now required to fill out a form any time they make a call or
referral to an immigration agency, you can request those databases.
Dig deeper into grants such as Operation Stonegarden, where local law enforcement
officers work with Border Patrol along the border.
Request the Daily Activity Reports from the departments (after every shift, officers must
submit a written report that includes information such as number of hours worked,
locations, other officers involved and results). You can then convert rt that information
– often provided in PDFs – into a database you can analyze:

You can then match the case numbers from those arrests and match them to get
additional information (e.g. using booking information)
Request data broken down by officer who participated in Stonegarden, how many hours
of overtime did they work and how much did they earn:

How to organize your investigations?
•
•

•
•
•

Digitize your material so you can keep it organized, perform OCR and make it
searchable and shareable.
Transcribe your interviews. Trint is relatively cheap and can turn it around very
quickly. Services like rev.com; Transcription Associates; Transcribe and
TranscribeMe all produce decent transcriptions.
Make a spreadsheet of your contacts to keep your own head organized.
Make a timeline, again, to keep your own head organized. Whether you are
working on a long narrative or quick hit, there will always be a chronology.
Keep looking for characters. This is such a data-heavy beat but what audiences
typically care about is people. If you can find someone with a powerful life story
who illustrates the themes that you are highlighting, let them be your main
character. If that is not the case, don’t pin the story on them.
