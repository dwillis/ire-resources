Reaching sensitive sources
Be sure you want to talk to them. Trust your gut about sketchy sources.
Preparation is key. Background everyone.
Never assume they won’t talk to you. Always oﬀ er the opportunity.
Cold calls can work! Prepare what you’ll say in advance. Keep it simple,
direct. Be prepared for rejection, but don’t expect it.
● Try until they say no. Email, phone call, text, social media.
●

Conducting the interview
Meet them where they are. Phone is ﬁne, but aim to meet in person.
Prepare questions in advance; write them down.
Clarify background vs. OTR early.
Be clear upfront about using names, details
If you talk on background, go back later and ask: “You said X. Is there any
reason we can’t use this?”
● Record the interview. Even phone audio or amateur video will help with
details, emotion.
●

Getting to the heart of It
● Be patient. These conversations take time.
● Expect and accept emotion. Center yourself as a compassionate observer.
● Use silence. When someone starts to cry, don’t ﬁll the gap. Let them move
through the emotion.
● Don’t summarize their feelings: “You must have been scared.” “Weren’t
you angry?” Let them tell you.
● Make sure there are no surprises. Let them see the part of the story that’s
about them.
● Think of yourself as a tool to tell their story.

The long game
● Write letters in the mail
● Don’t need to ask a single question in the ﬁrst call. Just introduce yourself
and what you’re working on
● Report around them: Talk to parents, spouses, siblings and coworkers
● For people who don’t want to play: Send updates about what you’ve been
ﬁnding out
● Do the double call. People ignores unknown numbers.
● Text after you call. Millenials don’t know what voicemail is.
● Cold calls and door knocking

Honest, up front.
Explain what you are doing, why you
want to talk to them and how you
found them
“Millions of people might see this, for
years.”
Explain what they have to lose and
the others in their spot
Don’t mislead targets. “This is what I
found and I want to know your
perspective.”

Little interview tips
● Ask them to describe a scene
like it would look in a
slow-motion movie
● Follow-ups: How do you know
that? What makes you say that?
● Paraphrase what they said
back to them and see if you
got it right

“What was the ﬁrst
indication something was
wrong? Where exactly
were you standing? What
were your surroundings?
What were the sounds and
smells?”

Ames Alexander

Silence
“Above all, be quiet and listen.
Don’t step on answers or rush in with
the next question. Silence makes
people uncomfortable. They tend to
want to ﬁll it.”
