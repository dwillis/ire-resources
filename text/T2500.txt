Here are a few useful Internet sites that can help reporters understand complex health
care fraud and abuse issues or get other information on doctors and the health care
industry. Many have links to other helpful sites:
htt~:~/www.oia.hhs.aov/
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of
Inspector General. This site lists hundreds of reports on Medicare and Medicaid fraud
from ambulance rip-offs to X-rays.
h t t ~ : / / w w w . ~ a o . ~U.S.
o v Government Accountability Office, the audit arm of Congress,
has hundreds of audit reports with a search engine by subject. This is very helpful for
identifying trends and serious medical quality or other health care problems that have
gone uncorrected for years.
http://defaulteddocs.dhhs.aov/search.asp HHS Health Resources and Services
Administration lists $166,710,667 in student loan defaults by doctors, from chiropractors
to veterinarians. Can search by name.
http://www.healthlaw.org: This is the site of the National Health Law Project, an
advocacy group for the poor. The site does a good job explaining complex changes in
Medicaid and offering its views on them.

http://exclusions.oi~.hhs.~ov/home.html
This site allows for easy searching of doctors
and other health care professionals kicked out of Medicare and Medicaid for wrongdoing.
It includes information on the length of the "exclusion" and the reasons for it.
http://www.fsmb.org/members.htm Federation of State Medical Boards contains a decent
number of reports about "model" operations for state boards that regulate doctors. It also
has links to state licensing boards which can be searched to find disciplinary actions
against a doctor or information about their education and other credentials.
http://naag.ord National Association of Attorneys General site, not very helpful by itself,
but it does provide links to each state's attorney general and some do a decent job
keeping abreast of scams and fraud in health care.

http://hi~~o.findlaw.com/hippohome.html
Hippo is a chatty site that has good links to a
wide variety of health care policy information.
