HAVANA- Set against a backdrop of gutted buildings and faded hope, Michael is all
smiles.
He’s fifty-something, sports a greying moustache last in fashion in the ’70s, and stares out
from beneath a ball cap emblazoned with a red maple leaf.
Sauntering into a downtown Havana bar, his left arm wound tightly around the waist of
an attractive young Cuban woman, he’s in his element. She, meanwhile, is working.
The Vancouver Island native flashes a grin at two European mates who, like him, have
come to regard Havana as a second home. The bartender welcomes him like an old
friend. Everyone here, as the song goes, knows his name.
“There’s a lot worse places to be,” Michael says, in a toast to shared good fortune. “This is
the promised land.”
Michael is on the inside of a well-kept secret.
Canadians are travelling to Cuba in surprising numbers to sexually exploit young people
trapped in this socialist country’s underground sex tourism industry, a joint investigation
by the Toronto Star and El Nuevo Herald, the Spanish-language sister publication of the
Miami Herald, has found.
