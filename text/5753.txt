What are you trying to get done?
●

Data analysis?
Statistical modeling?
Web scraping?
Building web apps?
Producing data-driven visualizations?
Geospatial analysis?

Lots of languages have similar functions, but
different syntax and constructs
Javascript
for (let i =0; i < data.length; i++) {
let d = data[i];
// do something with the data
}
OR
data.forEach(d => {
// do something with the data
})
OR
for (const d of data) {
// do something with the data
}

Python
for d in data:
// do something with the data

But they’re all good at different things
tl, dr:
SQL - Data management/analysis, especially with large data sets
Python - Data analysis, building web apps, web scraping
R - Data analysis, exploring data visually, generating publication-ready viz
JavaScript - (almost!) all of the above

SQL
Structured Query Language
Uses
●
●

Managing your data within its database home
Cleaning data: Get your data into a relational database and fix what needs
fixin’ so you can do analysis
○
○
○

●

Formatting dates properly
Cleaning up typos
Fixing data entry errors, such as “2109” for “2019”

Data analysis

Grouping
Counting
Summing
And it can do math, too!

SQL: Journo-coders’ longtime gateway drug
No less authorities than IRE and NICAR have taught introductory SQL as a natural
progression from Excel in its boot camps for years now
If thousands of journalists with next to no previous data or programming
experience can learn SQL in NICAR boot camp, so can you!

SQL used to be the lingua franca of data journalism

SQL is still the lingua franca of managing data

If you’re just starting out in data journalism, SQL can probably do many of the things
you’re trying to do
There are multiple flavors of SQL (i.e., SQL, T-SQL, PostgreSQL) but they generally
use the same SQL concepts, like dialects of the same language. Learn the basics, you
will pick up the others pretty easily.
Most of the geeks at government agencies you’ll be interacting with as a data journalist
-- the people who actually collect and manage the data you want to get -- will have at
least some knowledge of SQL. Gov’t IT directors and database admins can be
expected to have fluency or near-fluency in SQL. They probably use it regularly to
manage the data you’re seeking. If you can speak SQL too, you can speak their
language.
The first hurdle to jump in data journalism is often getting the data you need.
Learning SQL can help you with that.

SQL can help you with much of the data reporting
process
Getting
the data

Managing
the data

Cleaning
the data

SQL can help you
with these steps

Analyzing
the data

Identifying
the story

Telling/
presenting
the story to
the reader

This is beyond
SQL’s abilities.
You’ll need
another tool or
language here.

Python
Fun Fact: Python got its name from “Monty Python’s Flying Circus”
Uses:
●
●

●

Web Scraping: Copying information off of
websites and storing it to a spreadsheet
Data Analysis: Grouping information or
parsing through datasets larger than you
can open in Excel
News Apps: Creating web apps to let
people interact with data

JavaScript
AKA Node.js

Front-end (in the browser) uses:
●
●

●
●

Web interactivity
Interactive graphics (in
collaboration with web/HTML APIs
like SVG, Canvas and WebGL!)
Ads 😔
Analytics tracking

Back-end (in a server/your terminal)
uses:
●
●
●

Geographic work
Building servers
Writing scripts for data analysis

JavaScript for Journalism

Commonly used libraries
(it’s okay to not know
them all!)
●
●
●
●
●
●

D3.js
React
Mapbox GL
Leaflet.js
Three.js
And many, many, many, many
more

JavaScript for Journalism (on the back-end)
npm === package manager === “the place you install others work”

Node.js may not be the best at everything, but it can do nearly everything
Statistics work?
Try Simple Statistics https://simplestatistics.org/
Geographic work?
Try Turf.js http://turfjs.org/
Machine learning work (for some reason)?
Try Tensorflow.js https://www.tensorflow.org/js/
The best part? Most libraries work both in the
browser and in Node.js
