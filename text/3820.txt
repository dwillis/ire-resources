Campaign Finance &
Political Influence
An overview

A Washington tale…
 Bank of America increased
the interest rate on Bonnie
Rushing’s credit card from
8 percent to 23 percent.

 Sen. Thomas Carper: “But
let me just ask you -- put
yourself in the shoes of the
credit card company…”

 And how do the credit
card companies feel
about Sen. Tom Carper?
 Rushing’s monthly
interest bill went from
about $150 to $674

 Small change to a U.S.
Senator’s campaign
committee…

Think of inputs and outputs

A more recent example…

No self interest?

Happens at state level…
 You may recall Gov. Rick
Perry
 Texas Tech fund
rewarded donors
 They gave in $32K-$310K
range
 They got millions back

…and at the local level
 Donors gave Kasim Reed
campaign contributions
 Insiders raised money for
Reed’s mayoral campaign
 Airport concessions
awarded to…
 Big donors to Reed’s
campaign
 Big fundraisers for Reed’s
campaign

Multiple means to exert influence
 Hire former staffers as
lobbyists
 Hire former lawmakers,
councilmen, etc.

 Contribute to inaugural events
 Give money to lawmaker
charities
 Give to super PACs
 Hire relatives of elected
officials

Politicians have lots of pockets
 Campaigns
 Parties
 Leadership PACs

 Nonprofits
 Businesses & investments

 Super PACs
 Family members

Businesses can pick the pocket(s)
 Lots of places to look
 We’ll suggest some
resources
 Not all this money can be
traced
 Sometimes, you need
sources

One thing to remember is that all of
this is governed by rules
 Federal election law, lobbying
disclosure, congressional ethics
rules
 50 sets of state rules
 Some local jurisdictions have
rules specific to them
(sometimes dependent on state
law)

 In Colorado, corporate and labor donors are banned, except
when they aren’t
 Colorado Springs is the largest home rule municipality in
Colorado

Let’s look at the federal level
 (inflation adjusted)
 Up to $2,500 per election
to a candidate, that is,
$2,500 for the primary,
$2,500 for the general
 $30,800 to a national party
committee (RNC, DCCC,
etc.)
 Up to $117,000 every two
years to PACs, parties,
candidates…

 (not inflation adjusted)
 Up to $5,000 to a Political
Action Committee per year
 $10,000 to state, district &
local party committee (for
use in federal elections,
that is) (combined limit)
 Unlimited amount to super
PAC for eligible U.S. donors

…but potentially a lot more if
they have a lot of friends
 Bundlers put together
networks of donors, all of
whom can write $500,
$1,000 or $2,500 checks
to campaigns
 They are important at all
levels

 We find bundlers at
presidential,
congressional, state and
probably local donors…

Unfortunately…
 While bundlers are bigger
than ever…
 No requirement at federal
level that they be disclosed

 You can always ask a
campaign “who the finance
committee is”
 But there’s no place to ask,
“Is CEO of this company a
bundler”
 Only one searchable (but
limited) resource…

 As part of the Honest
Leadership and Open
Government Act of 2007
 Registered lobbyists must
disclose the bundling of
contributions they do for
federal candidates
 Applies to individuals
they bring to fundraisers,
PACs they control or
persuade to contribute
 All bundles over $16,200
are reported
 Data available at
http://influenceexplorer.
com/fec/bundling

Easy to get around disclosure
 We see tons of invites like
this one
 Hosts commit to raise money
 Vast majority don’t show up
as bundlers
 Even when they’re lobbyists

What a business can do
 Form (and pay
expenses of) a political
action committee
 PACs can contribute
$5,000 per election (i.e.,
primary, general) to a
candidate; $15,000 to a
national party
committee; $5,000 to
state, district or local
parties per year; $5,000
to other PACs per year
 Funds must be
“segregated” from other
corporate money

Note this language…

 Where are corporations like ExxonMobil and
Imperial Oil, and labor unions as well, making
contributions?

Make donations to 501(c)’s

…and to Super PACs
 Mostly individual donors
 Few businesses show up
 But individuals run
companies
 Have interests before
gov’t

Hire lobbyists
 Lobbyists get access
 Lobbyists are also
contributors
 Federal disclosure at
InfluenceExplorer.com,
OpenSecrets.org
 State disclosure spread
over 50 state websites

Lots of lobbyists do lots of
fundraising
 Party Time tracks
fundraisers
 Lots of invitations
list “hosts”
 Hosts can be PACs or
lobbyists that
pledge to raise
money

Donate to inaugural committees
 All states have different
rules
 Sometimes donors can
give more
 Enron gave lots to
Bush’s Texas inaugural
 501(c)4s most common
vehicle
 Don’t always have to
disclose donors
 Check Guidestar.org

Pay for junkets
 Not always easy to
trace
 Disclosure for
Congress, Executive
Branch
 States, localities vary

Where do you get information?

Some other things to check…

disclosures

looking at have a
charitable arm?
 Who do they give money
to?
 Do they sponsor things
like charity golf games?
