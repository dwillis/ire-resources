Project Proposal

1. FOCUS. Write the lede of the story you would write if your project yields
what you expect to find. What is the point of this project? If applicable,
who or what is the target of this project? What new finding might this
produce? Will it have an impact on readers? What might change as a result?
2. SUMMARY. Roughly, outline the lede story you expect to find. Briefly,
outline the package or series you anticipate this project might produce.
3. DATA. List the documents or databases that will be used for the project.
What do you expect the data to reveal? What legal or technical barriers
stand between you and the data? (Note: Strong preference will be given to
proposals for which key basic data is already in hand.)
4. SOURCES. List the sources you expect to use in producing this story.
Include people you think might provide background and perspective, people who have
direct and/or expert knowledge of the subject, and people who are most
affected by the issue at hand.
5. TIME & MONEY. How much do you already know about this story? How long will
it take to report this story? How long will it take to write this story? Are
there any unusual costs associated with this story? (Note: The expectation
is that time on the projects team rotation will be used to report and write.
Prospecting and string gathering is to be done before preparing your
proposal. You will remain involved in editing and design after you have
returned to your team.)
6. IMPACT. Why do this story? Why do this story now? How is this story
different from stories like it done in the past? What will this story
accomplish?
7. VICTIMS. Who is harmed by what's going on? How and why are they harmed?
8. WINNERS. Who is profiting or benefiting from what's going on. Who and why?
9. READERS. How will this story affect our readers? Will they read it?
