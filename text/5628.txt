How to Write, Shoot and Tweet a News Event Alone

Pre-write context and background for stories so that you have material ready to go.
Work incrementally: Post a story based on what you have when news breaks.
Continue reporting, update. Repeat as needed.
○ Know what you need for the initial story. Is a photo the key? A quotation from
a specific person? Know the priorities and order your work accordingly.
Make social media do double duty. Live tweeting or Facebook Live footage can
provide you with notes or video to use in a story later.
“Shoot and f/8 and be there”: The most important thing you can do to get good
photos or video is to be ready to shoot when the action happens.
○ Take a lot of photos so you’re more likely to have good ones.

Find “recent formers.” Election losers, retired officials and others who once played
key roles in beats know where the bodies are. And they’re often happy to talk.
○ Ask the ‘For Dummies’ questions and for intros to current officials.
Credit ratings agency (S&P, Moody’s and Fitch) reports are great cheat sheets,
with overviews of fiscal health and major issues in your coverage area. Muni bond
offerings are chock full of useful info -- government structure, budget details and
lists of major taxpayers and employers.
○ Register for a free EMMA account. Set up alerts relevant to your beat.
Podcasts and audiobooks can be lifesavers when you’re in transit.

How to Own a Beat

Keep timelines for long-term stories, with links to key documents, dates and details.
Stockpile data. Keep crime, bridge, property, school, election and salary data on
hand. It’ll help when there’s breaking news and always be a good source of context.
Avoid turn-of-the-screw stories. If your competition is covering a dull committee
meeting, skip it and use that time to chase something more interesting.
Figure out who your competition has pissed off and cultivate them as sources.
