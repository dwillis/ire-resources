“Now, where did I put that?”

Using DocumentCloud to outline your story,
leave a trail of breadcrumbs to your best
documents & (maybe) save your sanity.

Organizing in
self-defense

DocumentCloud:

Getting started:
Create a free account
Create a project name

Start uploading: Documents, spreadsheets,
images and more.

Name-nesting starts with the document upload

Naming is everything: Vague
names are a dead end.
Finding this
document,
much less what
is in it, will be
time consuming,
and will not put
your notes at
your fingertips.

Helpful naming
looks
a lot
like
this.

 Project name
 Project finding
 Key
element/document
 Document
description
 Notes in documents

Example

1.Project: (Creating an
epidemic)
2.Finding: (Heroin)
3.Key Element: (Mexico)
4.Specific document
description. It’s only for
your eyes, so it can
should
be casual/shorthand

Bigger findings
to
smaller findings
to
even
smaller findings

Absent
thoughtful
naming, you
could quickly
have a mob
on your
hands.

Creating text bread crumbs:
Open the uploaded document thumbnail,
highlight text important to you and give it a title.
You have
the option
of making
your
highlighted
text public,
or private
to you.

The title of your highlighted
text will appear on the right
of the document.
Taking the time to
highlight and title
creates an
automatic outline of
your document’s
key points and
quotes.

Click on a note title and the note will pop open.

An example of lifting a quote from the highlighted
text and using it as a text title, so it’s immediately
visible even if you don’t open the document.

In the open
document,
selecting
“notes” will bring
up all notes

You also
have the
option of
searching
text in the
document

The thumbnail
images of
documents in
your project will
reflect if there are
notes. Clicking on
the “notes” will
pull up all notes
without having to
open the
document.

Example:
Oh, that’s
where I put the
thebaine!
Searching project, title
and text to find thebaine:
Project: Creating an epidemic
Title includes key finding: Heroin
Title also includes key element of
finding: Mexico
Five documents returned where
thebaine is mentioned in text.
Document: 3 pages in the first
document where thebaine is
mentioned.

Considerations
Do you want this document to be private or public?
Consider keeping it private until just before publication.
However, you cannot link to the document from your
story unless it is public.
You cannot move a document from one project to
another.
