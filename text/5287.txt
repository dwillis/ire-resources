Open Government Guide

Introductory Note
The OPEN GOVERNMENT GUIDE is a comprehensive guide to open government law and practice in
each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Fiftyone outlines detail the rights of reporters and other citizens to see information and attend meetings of state and
local governments.
The OPEN GOVERNMENT GUIDE — previously
published as Tapping Officials’ Secrets — is the sole reference on open government laws in many states.
Written to follow a standard outline to allow easy comparisons between state laws, the compendium has enabled
open government advocates in one state to use arguments
successful in other states to enhance access rights at home.
Press associations and lobbyists have been able to invoke
other sunshine laws as they seek reforms in their own.
Volunteer attorneys, expert in open government laws in
each state and in Washington, D.C., generously donated
their time to prepare the initial outlines for the first incarnation of this project in 1989. In most states these same
attorneys or their close associates updated and rewrote
the outlines for the 1993, 1997, 2001 and 2006 editions
as well this current 2011 edition.
Attorneys who are new to the compendium in this edition are also experts in open government and access issues, and we are grateful to them for their willingness to
share in this ongoing project to create the first and only
detailed treatise on state open government law. The rich
knowledge and experience all the participating attorneys
bring to this project make it a success.
While most of the initial users of this compendium
were journalists, we know that lawyers and citizens have
discovered it and find it to be indispensable as well.
At its core, participatory democracy decries locked files
and closed doors. Good citizens study their governors,
challenge the decisions they make and petition or vote for
change when change is needed. But no citizen can carry
out these responsibilities when government is secret.
Assurances of open government exist in the common
law, in the first state laws after colonization, in territorial
laws in the west and even in state constitutions. All states

iv

have passed laws requiring openness, often in direct response to the scandals spawned by government secrecy.
The U.S. Congress strengthened the federal Freedom
of Information Act after Watergate, and many states followed suit.
States with traditionally strong access laws include Vermont, which provides virtually unfettered access on many
levels; Florida, which was one of the first states to enact
a sunshine law; and Ohio, whose courts have issued several access-friendly rulings. Other jurisdictions, such as
Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia, have made
significant changes to their respective open government
laws since the fifth edition was published designed to
foster greater public access to information. Historically,
Pennsylvania had a reputation as being relatively nontransparent while the District of Columbia was known to
have a very restrictive open meetings law.
Some public officials in state and local governments
work hard to achieve and enforce open government laws.
The movement toward state freedom of information
compliance officers reflects a growing activism for access
to information in the states.
But such official disposition toward openness is exceptional. Hardly a day goes by when we don’t hear that a
state or local government is trying to restrict access to
records that have traditionally been public — usually because it is feared release of the records will violate someone’s “privacy” or threaten our nation’s security.
It is in this climate of tension between broad democratic mandates for openness and official preference for
secrecy that reporters and good citizens need to garner
their resources to ensure the passage and success of open
government laws.
The Reporters Committee genuinely hopes that the
OPEN GOVERNMENT GUIDE will help a vigorous press and citizenry to shape and achieve demands for
openness, and that it will serve as a primer for those who
battle in government offices and in the courts for access
to records and meetings. When challenges to secrecy are
successful, the news is better and so is the government.

User’s Guide
Whether you are using a guide from one state to find a
specific answer to an access issue, or the complete compendium encompassing all states to survey approaches to
a particular aspect of open government law around the
country, knowing a few basics on how the OPEN GOVERNMENT GUIDE is set up will help you to get the
most out of it.
Following the outline. Every state section is based on the
same standard outline. The outline is divided into two
parts: access to records and access to meetings.
Start by reviewing the table of contents for each state.
It includes the first two tiers of that state’s outline. Once
you are familiar with the structure of the outline, finding
specific information is simple. Typically, the outline begins by describing the general structure of the state law,
then provides detailed topical listings explaining access
policies for specific kinds of records or meetings.
Every state outline follows the standard outline, but
there will be some variations. Some contributors added
items within the outline, or omitted subpoints found in
the complete outline which were not relevant to that
state’s law. Each change was made to fit the needs of a
particular state’s laws and practices.
In general, outline points that appear in boldface type
are part of the standard outline, while additional topics
will appear in italicized type.
Whether you are using one state outline or any number
of outlines, we think you will find the outline form helpful in finding specific information quickly without having
to read an entire statute or search through many court
cases. But when you do need to consult statutes, you will
find the complete text of the relevant portions at the end
of each outline.
Additional copies of individual state booklets, or of the
compendium covering the 50 states and the District of
Columbia, can be ordered from The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 1101 Wilson Blvd., Suite
1100, Arlington, Virginia 22209, or by calling (703) 8072100. The compendium is available in electronic format
on CD.
The state outlines also are available on our World-Wide
Web site, www.rcfp.org/ogg. The Internet version of the
outlines allows you to search the database and compare
the law in different states.

The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press

Updates: The Reporters Committee published new
editions of THE OPEN GOVERNMENT GUIDE in
1989, 1993, 1997, 2001, 2006, and now in 2011. We expect future updates to follow on approximately the same
schedule. If we become aware of mistakes or material
omissions in this work, we will post notices on this project’s page on our World-Wide Web site, at www.rcfp.org/
ogg. This does not mean that the outlines will constantly
be updated on the site —
­ it simply means known errors
will be corrected there.
For our many readers who are not lawyers: This book
is designed to help journalists, lawyers, and citizens understand and use state open records and meetings law.
Although the guides were written by lawyers, they are
designed to be useful to and readable by nonlawyers as
well. However, some of the elements of legal writing may
be unfamiliar to lay readers. A quick overview of some of
these customs should suffice to help you over any hurdles.
Lawyers are trained to give a “legal citation” for most
statements of law. The name of a court case or number
of a statute may therefore be tacked on to the end of a
sentence. This may look like a sentence fragment, or may
leave you wondering if some information about that case
was omitted. Nothing was left out; inclusion of a legal
citation provides a reference to the case or statute supporting the statement and provides a shorthand method
of identifying that authority, should you need to locate it.
Legal citation form also indicates where the law can be
found in official reporters or other legal digests. Typically,
a cite to a court case will be followed by the volume and
page numbers of a legal reporter. Most state cases will be
found in the state reporter, a larger regional reporter, or
both. A case cite reading 123 A.2d 456 means the case
could be found in the Atlantic (regional) reporter, second
series, volume 123, starting at page 456.
Note that the complete citation for a case is often given
only once. We have tried to eliminate as many cryptic
second-reference cites as possible, but you may encounter cites like “Jackson at 321.” This means that the author
is referring you to page 321 of a case cited earlier that includes the name Jackson. Authors may also use the words
supra or infra to refer to a discussion of a case appearing
earlier or later in the outline, respectively.
Except for these legal citation forms, most “legalese”
has been avoided. We hope this will make this guide more
accessible to everyone.

FOREWORD
Arizona Public Records Law (A.R.S. §§ 39-121 to -128): The
Arizona Public Records Law can be traced to territorial days, when
in 1901 the law was first enacted. The Arizona Supreme Court has
observed that “[h]istorically, this state has always favored open government and an informed citizenry.” Arizona Newspapers Ass’n, Inc.
v. Superior Court, 143 Ariz. 560, 564, 694 P.2d 1174, 1178 (1985); see
also Phoenix Newspapers, Inc. v. Keegan, 201 Ariz. 344, 351, 35 P.3d 105,
112 (Ct. App. 2001) (“The core purpose of the public records law is
to allow the public access to official records and other government
information so that the public may monitor the performance of government officials and their employees.”) (citation omitted).
Arizona’s statutory scheme is simple, providing “a broad right of
inspection to the public.” Carlson v. Pima County, 141 Ariz. 487, 489,
687 P.2d 1242, 1244 (1984). By statute, “[p]ublic records and other
matters in the custody of any officer shall be open to inspection by
any person at all times during office hours.” A.R.S. § 39-121. Once
it is determined that a record is “reasonably necessary or appropriate
to maintain an accurate knowledge of . . . official activities and of any
. . . activities which are supported by monies from the state or any political subdivision of the state,” the document is presumptively open to
public inspection. A.R.S. § 39-121.01(B); see also Carlson, 141 Ariz. at
490, 687 P.2d at 1245. As the Arizona Supreme Court has proclaimed,
the Arizona Public Records Law evinces “[a] strong policy favoring
open disclosure and access.” Cox Arizona Publ’ns, Inc. v. Collins, 175
Ariz. 11, 14, 852 P.2d 1194, 1198 (1993); see also Carlson, 141 Ariz. at
491, 687 P.2d at 1246 (noting that “access and disclosure is the strong
policy of the law”).
There are no statutory exceptions to disclosure found in the Arizona Public Records Law. The courts, however, have identified three
major exceptions to the presumption favoring disclosure: (1) confidentiality (i.e., when some other statute or regulation specifically protects records from disclosure), (2) privacy of persons, and (3) whenever
disclosure would be “detrimental to the best interests of the state.”
Carlson, 141 Ariz. at 490, 687 P.2d at 1245.
Traditionally, the Arizona statutory scheme has favored reporters
and other persons seeking access to public records. To date, efforts to
have wholesale legislative amendments to the law have failed.
Arizona’s Open Meetings Law (A.R.S. §§ 38-431 to -431.09
(“OML”)): Before enactment of open meetings legislation, Arizona
provided little official access to governmental meetings. In 1962, after
eight previous attempts, the Arizona Legislature finally adopted an
open meetings statute. The original Act served as a framework and
was not nearly as broad as the current OML. The 1962 Act remained
unchanged—in fact, no judicial interpretations of the Act were reported until 1974. The 1974 amendments amplified the Act—expanding
definitions, requiring notice and minutes of meetings, detailing execu-

tive sessions, allowing ratification of violations by public bodies, and
providing for equitable relief and exceptions. See Ariz. Att’y Gen. Op.
No. 75-5 (1975); D. Mitchell, Public Access to Governmental Records and
Meetings in Arizona, 16 Ariz. L. Rev. 891 (1974).
Since 1974, the Legislature has passed numerous amendments
strengthening the Act, many in response to an adverse judicial decision or attorney general’s opinion. Most notably, these changes
included (1) replacing the term “governing body” with the current
“public body”; (2) using the word “meeting” instead of “proceeding,”
“regular meeting” or “official meeting”; and (3) expanding the declaration of public policy for open meetings.
[Note: Due to the numerous substantive amendments, a practitioner must take care not to rely on case law interpreting previous versions of the OML. Because of the changes to the OML, the outline
does not refer to Arizona case law regarding the OML that is irrelevant to the current form of the statute.]
Arizona’s OML also contains two unusual provisions. First, a public body may ratify actions it takes in violation of the OML. A.R.S.
§ 38-431.05. Second, in some circumstances, a court may remove a
public officer from office as a penalty for violating the law. A.R.S. §
38-431.07(A).
Despite the numerous changes to the Act, its primary purpose has
remained the same—to require multimember public bodies (such as
the Legislature, city councils and school boards) to conduct their business openly. See Long v. City of Glendale, 208 Ariz. 319, 325, 93 P.3d
519, 525 (Ct. App. 2004) (stating that “the policy [of the OML] is to
open the conduct of the business of government to the scrutiny of the
public and to ban decision-making in secret”) (citation and internal
quotation marks omitted). To that end, the law clearly and simply
provides: “All meetings of any public body shall be public meetings
and all persons so desiring shall be permitted to attend and listen to
the deliberations and proceedings.” A.R.S. § 38-431.01(A).
The current declaration of public policy is a strong foundation for
gaining access to meetings. It states:
It is the public policy of this state that meetings of public
bodies be conducted openly and that notices and agendas be
provided for such meetings which contain such information
as is reasonably necessary to inform the public of the matters
to be discussed or decided. Toward this end, any person or
entity charged with the interpretations of this article shall
construe this article in favor of open and public meetings.
§ 38-431.09(A). Unfortunately, although occasionally referred to
by appellate courts, no appellate court has expressly relied upon this
section to support a decision enforcing the OML.
Historically, the Arizona Attorney General’s Office has served as a
strong proponent of the Act. When the OML was amended in 1982,
the Attorney General was specifically empowered to initiate litigation
to secure compliance with the law. Following the 1982 amendments,
the Attorney General developed an Open Meetings Law Enforcement
Task Force (“OMLET”) designed to achieve enforcement of the Act.
The Attorney General’s Office has cooperated with the press in pursuing legal action against violators of the Act. Attorney General Opinions, however, sometimes reflect a retraction from the OML’s general
policy of access. Fortunately, Attorney General Opinions are not
binding on Arizona courts. See City of Prescott v. Town of Chino Valley,
166 Ariz. 480, 483 n.2, 803 P.2d 891, 894 n.2 (1990).

Under the Arizona Public Records Law, “any person” may inspect
public records. A.R.S. § 39-121.
2.

Purpose of request.

“A person’s right to public records under the Public Records Law
is not conditioned on his or her showing, or a court finding, that the
documents are relevant to anything.” Bolm v. Custodian of Records of
Tucson Police Dep’t, 193 Ariz. 35, 39, 969 P.2d 200, 204 (Ct. App. 1998).
Commercial Use. Public records may be used for commercial purposes. A.R.S. § 39-121.03(A).
If the records custodian determines that the proposed commercial
use of public records would constitute “a misuse of public records or
. . . an abuse of the right to receive public records, the custodian may
apply to the governor requesting that the governor by executive order
prohibit the furnishing of copies, printouts or photographs for such
commercial purpose.” A.R.S. § 39-121.03(B). If the governor fails to
issue an executive order prohibiting the disclosure within thirty (30)
days of the application date, the custodian of public records must provide the copies, printouts or photographs upon being paid the statutory fee. Id.
3.

Use of records.

The Arizona Public Records Law makes no restrictions on the subsequent use of the information provided.
B.

Whose records are and are not subject to the act?

The Arizona Public Records Law contains two operative definitions—“officer” and “public body”—for the purpose of subjecting
certain documents to disclosure under the law.
“Officer” is defined as “any person elected or appointed to hold any
elective or appointive office of any public body and any chief administrative officer, head, director, superintendent or chairman of any public body.” A.R.S. § 39-121.01(A)(1).
“Public bodies” are defined by statute as “the state, any county, city,
town, school district, political subdivision or tax-supported district in
the state, any branch, department, board, bureau, commission, council
or committee of the foregoing, and any public organization or agency,
supported in whole or in part by monies from the state or any political
subdivision of the state, or expending monies provided by the state or
any political subdivision of the state.” A.R.S. § 39-121.01(A)(2). The
operative definition of a “public body” in Arizona is very broad. Indeed, any “public organization or agency” supported by or expending
public funds falls within the ambit of the Act.
Exempt Agencies: No Arizona agencies are exempted in their entirety.
Every officer and every public body are obligated to preserve, maintain and care for public records pursuant to Arizona law. A.R.S. §
39-121.01(C).
C. What records are and are not subject to the act?
1.

What kind of records are covered?

As indicated above, the Arizona Public Records Law applies to all
documents in the custody of public officers, who are obliged “to make
and maintain records reasonably necessary to provide knowledge of all
activities they undertake in the furtherance of their duties.” Carlson,
141 Ariz. at 490, 687 P.2d at 1245. But “the mere fact that a writing is
Page 2

in the possession of a public officer or public agency does not make it a
public record.” Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Cmty., 168 Ariz. 531,
538, 815 P.2d 900, 907 (1991). Rather, a public officer must generate
or use a record in a capacity related to his official duties for that record
to be a “public record.” Id. Therefore, “only those documents having
a ‘substantial nexus’ with a government agency’s activities qualify as
public records.” Griffis v. Pinal County, 215 Ariz. 1, 4, 156 P.3d 418,
421 (2007).
2.

What physical form of records are covered?

The statute’s reference to “[p]ublic records and other matters”
strongly suggests that tangible records other than print material are
also subject to inspection and copying under the statute. A.R.S. § 39121 (emphasis added). In KPNX-TV v. Superior Court, the court held
that “Arizona’s definition of public records can include videotapes,”
as well as “all existing documents, papers, letters, maps, books, tapes,
photographs, films, sound recording or other materials, regardless of
physical form or characteristics.” 183 Ariz. 589, 592, 905 P.2d 598,
601 (Ct. App. 1995); see also Star Publ’g Co. v. Pima County Attorney’s
Office, 181 Ariz. 432, 433-34, 891 P.2d 899, 900-01 (Ct. App. 1994)
(computer backup tapes which include e-mail communication of employees are subject to public records law).
3.

Are certain records available for inspection but not
copying?

The statute makes no distinction between the public’s right to
“examine” and its related right to obtain “copies, printouts or photographs of any public record during regular office hours.” A.R.S.
§ 39-121.01(D)(1).
If the custodian “does not have facilities for making copies, printouts
or photographs of a public record,” the requester “shall be granted access to the public record for the purpose of making copies, printouts
or photographs.” A.R.S. § 39-121.01(D)(2). But the copies, printouts
or photographs must be made “while the public record is in the possession, custody and control of the custodian of the public record and
shall be subject to the supervision of such custodian.” A.R.S. § 39121.01(D)(3).
D. Fee provisions or practices.
The Arizona Public Records Law distinguishes between records
requested for a “commercial purpose” versus a “non-commercial purpose.”
Non-Commercial Purpose:
For “non-commercial purposes,” the Public Records Law mandates
the furnishing of such copies, printouts or photographs and permits
the custodian of records to “charge a fee if the facilities are available”
for most records. A.R.S. § 39-121.01(D)(1).
State law, however, prohibits a state, county, city or any officer or
board from demanding or receiving “a fee or compensation for issuing
certified copies of public records or for making search for them, when
they are to be used in connection with a claim for a pension, allotment,
allowance, compensation, insurance or other benefits which is to be
presented to the United States or a bureau or department thereof.”
A.R.S. § 39-122(A). Moreover, a crime victim or an immediate family
member is entitled to receive one free copy of the police report and
the minute entry or transcript “that arises out of the offense committed against the victim and that is reasonably necessary for the purpose
of pursuing a claimed victim’s right.” A.R.S. § 39-127(A).
While some public bodies have attempted to impose prohibitively
high fees to discourage requests under the law, the media has succeeded in challenging and reducing such fees. Cf. Phoenix Newspapers,
Inc. v. Purcell, 187 Ariz. 74, 79-80, 927 P.2d 340, 345-46 (Ct. App.
1996) (finding the high costs imposed by A.R.S. § 16-168(E) for producing voter registration lists was reasonable because “[it]cannot sit
as a super-legislature to determine the wisdom, the necessity, or the
inconvenience of a legislative enactment”).

Commercial Purpose:
A “commercial purpose” is defined as
the use of a public record for the purpose of sale or resale
or for the purpose of reproducing a document containing all
or part of the copy, printout or photograph for sale or the
obtaining of names and addresses from public records for the
purpose of solicitation or the sale of names and addresses to
another for the purpose of solicitation or for any purpose in
which the purchaser can reasonably anticipate the receipt of
monetary gain from the direct or indirect use of the public
record. Commercial purpose does not mean the use of a
public record as evidence or as research for evidence in an
action in any judicial or quasi-judicial body.
A.R.S. § 39-121.03(D).
A person requesting copies, printouts or photographs of public
records for a commercial purpose “shall provide a statement setting
forth the commercial purpose for which the copies, printouts or photographs will be used.” A.R.S. § 39-121.03(A). Upon receiving the
statement, the custodian of records may provide reproductions for a
charge consisting of the following:
1.      A portion of the cost to the public body for obtaining the original or copies of the documents, printouts or photographs.
2.      A reasonable fee for the cost of time, materials,
equipment and personnel in producing such reproduction.
3.      The value of the reproduction on the commercial market as best determined by the public body.
A.R.S. § 39-121.03(A).
If records are used for a commercial purpose when obtained for a
noncommercial purpose or for another commercial purpose, the person in addition to other penalties may be liable for (1) three times the
amount charged for the records, plus costs and reasonable attorneys’
fees, or (2) three times actual damages if the public records would not
have been disclosed for that specific commercial purpose. A.R.S. §
39-121.03(C).
Arizona media consistently have taken the position that journalists involved in newsgathering activities are not seeking records for
a “commercial purpose.” The Superior Court and Arizona Attorney General have agreed with that position. Media America Corp. v.
Phoenix Police Dep’t, 21 Media L. Rep. (BNA) 2087 (Maricopa County
Super. Ct. 1993); Ariz. Att’y. Gen. Op. No. I86-90. In addition, the
Arizona Court of Appeals has stated that “[l]earning facts from public records that might inform one on a daily occupation or might be
newsworthy would not be a commercial purpose.” Star Publ’g Co. v.
Parks, 178 Ariz. 604, 605, 875 P.2d 837, 838 (Ct. App. 1993).

Availability of an ombudsman.

In Arizona, any citizen may complain to the Office of the Ombudsman-Citizens Aide regarding the actions of an agency. A.R.S. §§ 411371 to -1378. In response to a complaint, the Ombudsman-Citizens
Aide has the power to investigate the administrative acts of agencies
and make recommendations to the governor, the legislature, and/or
the appropriate prosecutor. A.R.S. §§ 41-1376 to -1378. Certain
governmental entities, including the governor, attorney general, state
treasurer and secretary of state, are exempt from this law. A.R.S. §
41-1372.

2.

Discussion of each exemption.

There are no specific exceptions to disclosure codified in the Arizona Public Records Law.
B.

Other statutory exclusions.

Arizona’s Public Records Law appears all-encompassing, but numerous separate statutes reduce its impact by deeming several records
“confidential.” Generally, the records of certain professional groups,
legal proceedings, law enforcement agencies and health facilities are
classified as confidential. Several statutes are discussed topically, but
there may be other statutes that are applicable to other records.
Moreover, the Public Records Law does not require the disclosure
of public records or other matters pertaining to the “location of archaeological discoveries” or “places or objects that are included on or
may qualify for inclusion on the Arizona register of historic places[,]
. . . if the officer determines that the release of the information creates
a reasonable risk of vandalism, theft or other damage” to these places
or items. A.R.S. § 39-125.
C. Court-derived exclusions, common law prohibitions,
recognized privileges against disclosure.
The Arizona Supreme Court has recognized three common law circumstances in which documents can be withheld: (i) confidentiality,
(ii) privacy or (iii) disclosure against the best interest of the state. See
Carlson, 141 Ariz. at 490, 687 P.2d at 1245. “If these interests outweigh the public’s right of inspection, the [public body] can properly
refuse inspection. The [public body] bears the burden of overcoming the legal presumption favoring disclosure.” See Scottsdale Unified
School Dist. No. 48 of Maricopa County v. KPNX Broad. Co., 191 Ariz.
297, 300, 955 P.2d 534, 537 (1998) (citation and internal quotation
marks omitted).
Arizona Courts also have on occasion looked to the exceptions
contained in the federal Freedom of Information Act for guidance.

“Nothing in this chapter requires the disclosure of a risk assessment
that is performed by or on behalf of a federal agency to evaluate critical energy, water or telecommunications infrastructure to determine
its vulnerability to sabotage or attack.” A.R.S. § 39-126.
III. STATE LAW ON ELECTRONIC RECORDS
A.

Can the requester choose a format for receiving
records?

No Arizona statute or case addresses this issue. As a matter of practice, reporters have been able to choose a format for receiving records.
If a record is requested in its native format, the public body must provide it in that format. See Lake v. City of Phoenix, 222 Ariz. 547, 551,
218 P.3d 1004, 1008 (2009).
B.

Can the requester obtain a customized search of
computer databases to fit particular needs?

No Arizona statute or case addresses this issue.
C. Does the existence of information in electronic format
affect its openness?
No. Star Publ’g, 181 Ariz. at 433-34, 891 P.2d at 900-01. Indeed, “if
a public entity maintains a public record in an electronic format, then
the electronic version, including any embedded metadata, is subject
to disclosure under [Arizona’s] public record laws.” Lake, 222 Ariz. at
548, 218 P.3d at 1005.
D. How is e-mail treated?
Emails on a government computer system that pertain to government business are public records. See Griffis, 215 Ariz. at 5, 156 P.3d at
422. But emails relating solely to personal matters will not have “the
requisite substantial nexus to government activities” and therefore are
not subject to disclosure. Id.

IV. RECORD CATEGORIES — OPEN OR CLOSED
A.

Autopsy reports.

Autopsy reports are not “vital records” that are confidential under
A.R.S. § 36-342. See A.R.S. § 36-301(33) (defining vital records as
either “a registered birth certificate or a registered death certificate”).
A.R.S. § 11-597 does not prohibit disclosure of autopsy reports, but it
only expressly provides for disclosure to county attorneys. In contrast,
A.R.S. § 23-1072(A) expressly provides that the pathologist’s findings
become part of the public record when the Industrial Commission of
Arizona orders the performance of the autopsy.
In Parks, the court held that “autopsy reports are public records
under A.R.S. §§ 11-594 and -597” and that the Pima County Forensic
Center could not hold up disclosure pending notification of relatives
unless it can point to “specific risks with respect to a specific disclosure.” 178 Ariz. at 605, 875 P.2d at 838. Although autopsy reports,
autopsy photographs, and investigative materials are public records,
a court must conduct an in camera review to balance competing interests before permitting the release of any documents because they
“inherently raise significant privacy concerns.” Schoeneweis v. Hamner,
223 Ariz. 169, 173,175-76, 221 P.3d 48, 52, 54-55 (Ct. App. 2009).
B.

Administrative enforcement records (e.g.,
worker safety and health inspections, or accident
investigations)

Public matter on private e-mail

Arizona courts look at the nature and purpose of the document, not
whether it is on a private or public email, to determine whether it is a
public record. Griffis, 215 Ariz. at 4, 156 P.3d at 421.
5.

sages, but the same that applies to email in Section III(D) above would
likley apply to text messages and instant messages.

“[T]he records of the Industrial Commission’s proceedings, orders
and awards must be considered as public records[,] . . . [b]ut information which is not collected to serve as a memorial of an official
transaction or for dissemination of information is private except as to
a claimant or parties” as defined by statute. Indus. Comm’n v. Holohan,
97 Ariz. 122, 126, 397 P.2d 624, 627 (1964).
When investigating minimum wage violations, all payroll or other business records obtained by the Industrial Commission or a law
enforcement officer will be kept confidential, unless required by the
prosecution. A.R.S. § 23-364(D).

cant’s competitive position.” A.R.S. §§ 41-1505.06(G), 41-1505.07(J).

All records of the State Banking Department are not public records
and cannot be disclosed except to certain specified persons. A.R.S. §
6-129.

J.

But A.R.S. § 6-129.01 provides that all documents filed by enterprises with the State Banking Department are open to public inspection, except for any information the superintendent determines in his
judgment must be withheld for the public welfare or for the welfare
of the financial enterprise. An “enterprise” is defined as any person
under the jurisdiction of the department other than “banks, trust companies, savings and loan associations, credit unions, consumer lenders,
international banking facilities and financial institution holding companies” under the department’s jurisdiction. See A.R.S. § 6-101(6), (8).

A registration form constitutes an official public record once
completed and signed by the elector and received by the county
recorder. A.R.S. § 16-161. But certain public officials and victims of domestic violence can prevent the general public from
accessing their residential address, telephone number, and voting
precinct number by filing an affidavit with the state. A.R.S. § 16153; see Primary Consultants, L.L.C. v. Maricopa County Recorder,
210 Ariz. 393, 397-98, 111 P.3d 435, 439-40 (Ct. App. 2005) (noting that voter registration records are public records subject to
certain restrictions).

D. Budgets.
Water facilities districts will keep several records, including its annual budget, open to inspection by the public. A.R.S. § 48-5913(A)(4).
E.

Business records, financial data, trade secrets.

No specific statute generally exempts business records, financial
data or trade secrets from the rule favoring disclosure of public records in Arizona. In several areas, however, records, trade secrets and
proprietary data have been protected by individual statutes. See, e.g.,
A.R.S. § 3-374(A)(1) (pesticide control); A.R.S. § 27-112(A) (geologic,
engineering and feasibility studies); A.R.S. § 27-234(H) (lease of state
lands for mineral claims); A.R.S. § 27-571 (well records); A.R.S. § 287707(A) (public-private partnerships in transportation); A.R.S. § 30808 (electric retail competition information); A.R.S. § 49-487(C)(1)
(air pollution); A.R.S. § 49-928(A)(1) (hazardous waste); A.R.S. § 49967(A)(1) (pollution prevention); A.R.S. § 49-1012(A) (underground
storage tanks).
In Ariz. Portland Cement Co. v. Ariz. State Tax Court, 185 Ariz. 354,
357, 916 P.2d 1070, 1073 (Ct. App. 1995), the court held that a taxpayer’s private business records, which were disclosed to the county assessor to protest the assessed valuation of its business property, remained
confidential and were not subject to A.R.S. § 39-121. Furthermore,
to the extent that the court turned to the Freedom of Information
Act for guidance in Church of Scientology, 122 Ariz. at 340, 594 P.2d at
1036, certain records containing trade secrets or commercial or financial information might be exempted from disclosure. See 5 U.S.C. §
552b(4).
F.

Contracts, proposals and bids.

Contracts, proposals and bids are usually only confidential until a
contract is awarded, unless the bidder designates and the state concurs
that trade secrets or other proprietary data must remain confidential.
See A.R.S. §34-603(H) (procurement of professional services); A.R.S.
§ 28-7366(G) (construction services); A.R.S. § 28-7367(G) (multiple
contracts for construction services); A.R.S. § 41-2533(D) (procurement project bids); A.R.S. § 41-2534(D) (procurement project proposals); see also A.R.S. § 38-658(A) (information reviewed by the Joint
Legislative Budget Committee regarding health plans for state employees); A.R.S. § 41-401(L) (deliberations of the Joint Legislative
Budget Committee and the Constitutional Defense Council about
legal expenses that will exceed $50,000).

Election records.
1.

Voter registration records.

A form showing a declination to register to vote is confidential
and may be used only for voter registration purposes. A.R.S. §
16-140I. Moreover, public access is prohibited to the death records sent by the Department of Health Services to the Secretary of State for purposes of removing deceased persons from the
statewide voter registration database. A.R.S. § 16-165(D).
2.

Voting results.

No partial or complete tallies of early elections will be divulged before all precincts have reported or one hour after the polls close on
election day, whichever occurs first. A.R.S. § 16-551I. The official
canvass of an election becomes part of the public record and is kept
by the Secretary of State, the appropriate city and town clerks, or the
clerk of the board of supervisors. A.R.S. § 16-646(B), (D).
Code marks on ballots used in the primaries or general election cannot be “marked in any manner that will disclose the identity of the
voter who votes that ballot.” A.R.S. §§ 16-466(B), 16-468(2).
The Arizona Secretary of State’s report that includes “information
on the number of ballots transmitted to absent uniformed services voters and overseas voters and the number of ballots returned and cast in
the election” is available to the public. A.R.S. § 16-142(B).
K. Gun permits.
Information and records maintained by the Department of Public
Safety on applicants for a concealed weapon permit, permit holders,
and instructors “shall not be available to any other person or entity
except on an order from a state or federal court.” A.R.S. § 13-3112(J).
L.

Hospital reports.

“Unless otherwise provided by law, all medical records . . . are privileged and confidential.” A.R.S. § 12-2292. “Medical record” includes
“all communications related to a patient’s physical or mental health
or condition that are recorded in any form or medium and that are
maintained for purposes of patient diagnosis or treatment, including medical records that are prepared by a health care provider or by
other providers.” A.R.S. § 12-2291(5). Thus, medical or other records containing personally identifiable information may only be disclosed pursuant to statute. See, e.g., A.R.S. § 36-160(A) (state or county
home health services); A.R.S. § 36-404(A)(2) (health care institutions);
A.R.S. § 36-568.01 (developmental disabilities); A.R.S. § 36-509 (behavioral health); A.R.S. § 36-664(F) (communicable diseases); A.R.S.
§ 36-887(B) (child care facilities); A.R.S. § 36-897.12 (child care group
homes); A.R.S. § 36-2152 (parental consent or court proceedings pertaining to unemancipated minors who want abortions); A.R.S. § 362220 (emergency medical services).
“The governing body of each licensed hospital or outpatient surgical center shall require that physicians admitted to practice in the
hospital or center organize into committees or other organizational
structures to review the professional practices within the hospital or
center for the purposes of reducing morbidity and mortality and for
the improvement of the care of patients provided in the institution.”
A.R.S. § 36-445. All proceedings, records, and materials prepared

in connection with these peer reviews are confidential. A.R.S. § 36445.01.
Many health care related boards acquire hospital and medical records during their investigations; these records are often statutorily
protected as confidential. See, e.g., A.R.S. § 32-1451.01(E) (Arizona
Medical Board); A.R.S. § 32-1551.01 (Naturopathic Physicians Medical Board); A.R.S. § 32-1664(M) (Board of Nursing); A.R.S. § 362245(M) (Department of Health Service’s oversight of ambulance services); A.R.S. § 32-3553(K) (Board of Respiratory Care). Not only are
the Arizona Medical Board’s investigative files not subject to A.R.S. §
39-121, they are absolutely privileged and not discoverable in civil litigation. Ariz. Bd. of Med. Exam’rs v. Superior Court, 186 Ariz. 360, 36162, 922 P.2d 924, 925-26 (Ct. App. 1996); but see State v. Ditsworth,
216 Ariz. 339, 342, 166 P.3d 130, 133 (Ct. App. 2007) (finding that §
32-1451(O) requires the Arizona Medical Board to make investigatory evidence available to the appropriate criminal justice agency if it
“determines that a criminal violation may have occurred involving the
delivery of health care”).

tion information in a state board’s possession cannot be revealed. See,
e.g., A.R.S. § 32-129(A) (architects), A.R.S. § 32-825(F) (podiatrists),
A.R.S. § 32-1209 (dentists), A.R.S. § 32-1310(A) (embalmers), A.R.S.
§ 32-1746 (optometrists), A.R.S. § 32-2214(F) (veterinarians).
4.

Personally identifying information.

The Arizona Public Records Law does not require “disclosure from
a personnel file by a law enforcement agency or employing state or local governmental entity of the home address or home telephone number of eligible persons.” A.R.S. § 39-123(A); see A.R.S. § 39-123(F)
(4) (defining “eligible person” to include, among others, “a peace officer, justice, judge, commissioner, public defender, prosecutor, code
enforcement officer, adult or juvenile corrections officer, corrections
support staff member, probation officer, member of the board of executive clemency, law enforcement support staff member” and domestic violence victims). In addition, a law enforcement agency can only
release a photograph of a peace officer under certain specified conditions. A.R.S. § 39-123(C).

Several statutes delegate the authority to form rules of confidentiality about health care records. See, e.g., A.R.S. § 36-107 (giving the
Department of Health Services the power to designate confidentiality), A.R.S. § 36-2903(I) (directing the Director of the Arizona Health
Care Cost Containment System to “prescribe by rule the types of information that are confidential and circumstances under which such
information may be used or released”).

The names of prospects for university president, and presumably
other high-level positions in public agencies, are confidential as revealing this information “could chill the best possible candidates for
the position.” Ariz. Bd. of Regents, 167 Ariz. at 258, 806 P.2d at 352.
But “[c]andidates who actively seek a job run the risk of their desire
becoming public knowledge” and therefore their names can be released to the media. Id.

Disclosures of medical records also need to comply with the HIPAA
privacy regulations. See 45 C.F.R. Parts 160, 162 & 164. Similarly,
records maintained in connection with the performance of a program
or activity relating to substance abuse education, prevention, training,
treatment, rehabilitation or research that is regulated or directly or
indirectly assisted by the United States government must comply with
the regulations implementing the federal substance abuse law. See 42
C.F.R. Part 2.

“The identity of executioners and other persons who participate or
perform ancillary functions in an execution and any information contained in records that would identify those persons is confidential and
is not subject to disclosure” to the public. A.R.S. § 13-757I.

M. Personnel records.
With respect to other information in personnel records, the Arizona Supreme Court has found that individuals’ privacy interests can
put portions of public personnel files beyond the reach of A.R.S. §
39-121 if those interests outweigh the public’s right of inspection. See
Scottsdale Unified School Dist., 191 Ariz. at 302-03, 955 P.2d at 53940 (determining that the public interest in disclosure of the teachers’
birth dates was speculative and did not override the privacy interest
of the teachers); Bolm, 193 Ariz. at 39-40, 969 P.2d at 204-05 (finding
that the trial court appropriately concluded that the police department’s hiring and official records, but not personnel evaluations or
internal affairs records, were subject to disclosure).
1.

Salary.

An Arizona court has recognized that payroll records of public employees are public records. See Phoenix New Times, 217 Ariz. at 544,
177 P.3d at 286.
2.

Disciplinary records.

A public body must provide access to “all records that are reasonably necessary or appropriate to maintain an accurate knowledge of
disciplinary actions, including the employee responses to all disciplinary actions, involving public officers or employees of the public body.”
A.R.S. § 39-128(A). But the public body is not required to disclose
any person’s home address, home telephone number, or photograph.
A.R.S. § 39-128(B).
3.

Applications.

In Bohm v. Custodian of Records of Tucson Police Dep’t, the court held
that the police department’s disclosure of hiring and official records
was proper. 193 Ariz. 35, 969 P.2d 200 (Ct. App. 1998).
For multiple professional groups, the law provides that applicaPage 6

N. Police records.
The release of police records is governed by the Arizona Public Records Law. See Little v. Gilkinson, 130 Ariz. 415, 416, 636 P.2d 663,
664 (Ct. App. 1981) (“Although many states exempt police investigatory reports from their public-records access statutes, Arizona does
not.”).
1.

Accident reports.

Accident reports are available for review for a non-commercial purpose. However, a law enforcement agency “[s]hall not allow a person
to examine the [motor vehicle] accident report or any related investigation report or a reproduction of the accident report or a related
investigation report if the request is for a commercial solicitation purpose.”
A.R.S. § 28-667I(1) (emphasis added).
2.

Police blotter.

Not addressed.
3.

911 tapes.

Tapes of 911 calls are available to the public, “unless the government puts forward an interest that justifies withholding access” to the
tapes. See A.H. Belo Corp. v. Mesa Police Dep’t, 202 Ariz. 184, 187, 42
P.3d 615, 618 (Ct. App. 2002) (finding that the privacy of the injured
child and his family were sufficient countervailing interests to preclude
release of a 911 tape). When transcripts of the calls are available, the
public interest in the tapes is decreased because the same information is available by alternate means. Id. at 188, 42 P.3d at 188 (noting
that the television station did not argue that “the tape advances the
purpose of the Public Records Act in any way that the transcript does
not satisfy”).
4.

Investigatory records.

In Cox Arizona Publications Inc. v. Collins, 175 Ariz. 11, 14, 852 P.2d
1194, 1998 (1993), the Arizona Supreme Court reversed the court of
appeals’ ruling that the public is not entitled to examine police reports
in “an active ongoing criminal prosecution.” The Arizona Supreme
Court held that such a “blanket rule . . . contravenes the strong policy
The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press

Open Government Guide
favoring open disclosure and access.” Thus, public officials bear the
“burden of showing the probability that specific, material harm will
result from disclosure” before it may withhold police records. Mitchell
v. Superior Court, 142 Ariz. 332, 335, 690 P.2d 51, 54 (1984).
However, A.R.S. § 13-2813 prohibits disclosing “an indictment, information or complaint . . . before the accused person is in custody or
has been accused.”
a.

Rules for active investigations.

“[R]eports of ongoing police investigations are not generally exempt from [Arizona’s] public records law,” so they must be disclosed
unless the law enforcement agency can “specifically demonstrate how
production of the documents would violate rights of privacy or confidentiality, or would be detrimental to the best interests of the state.”
Cox Ariz. Publ’ns, 175 Ariz. at 14, 852 P.2d at 1198 (internal quotation
marks omitted).
5.

Arrest records.

If accused, the arrest record of a juvenile who has been referred to
juvenile court is open for public inspection. A.R.S. § 8-208(A). Arrest
reports of other offenders are public records. Phoenix New Times, 217
Ariz. at 545, 177 P.3d at 287.
6.

Compilations of criminal histories.

Criminal histories maintained by the Board of Fingerprinting are
exempt from the Arizona Public Records Law, except for a report that
provides the number of applications for a good cause exception and
the number of applications that were granted. A.R.S. § 41-619.54.
7.

Victims.

A crime victim or immediate family member is entitled to one free
copy of the police report and any applicable minute entry and transcript. A.R.S. § 39-127(A).
8.

Confessions.

Confessions in police records are public records and thus presumed
open for inspection and copying.
9.

Confidential informants.

“A record of a communication between a person submitting a report of criminal activity to a silent witness, crime stopper or operation
game thief program . . . is not a public record.” A.R.S. § 12-2312.
10. Police techniques.
Wiretapping activity cannot be revealed except to specific public
officials involved in the investigation. A.R.S. § 13-3011.
11. Mug shots.
Mug shots are public records and thus presumed open for inspection and copying.
12. Sex offender records.
The Department of Public Safety maintains a website for sexual offenders who have been given a level two or level three risk assessment.
A.R.S. § 13-3827(A). The website will provide (1) the offender’s
name, address, and age, (2) a current photograph, and (3) the offense
committed and notification level. Id. After a sexual offender has been
released from confinement, the local law enforcement agency will notify the community of the offender’s presence. A.R.S. § 13-3825(C).
13. Emergency medical services records.
With some exceptions, information, records, and data pertaining
to the administration or evaluation of the Arizona emergency medical services system or trauma system are open to the public. A.R.S.
§ 36-2220(A). Prehospital incident history reports also are available
to the public provided confidential or other protected information is
removed. A.R.S. § 36-2220(C). But medical records or other records
The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press

Arizona
containing personally identifiable information may not be released
unless required by law or pursuant to authorization. A.R.S. § 362220(A)(1), (B).
O. Prison, parole and probation reports.
All records pertaining to the care and custody of prisoners are open
to public inspection, except those portions that reveal the identity of
a confidential informant, endanger a person’s life or physical safety, or
jeopardize an ongoing criminal investigation. A.R.S. § 31-221I; see,
e.g., KPNX-TV, 183 Ariz. at 593, 905 P.2d at 602 (determining that
the state has a legitimate security concern about disclosing a videotape
showing undercover officers because of the risk, however slight, that
they might be harmed).
A prisoner’s medical history, however, is confidential and may be
used only in accordance with A.R.S. § 41-1606(B) and other applicable
laws.
P.

Public utility records.

“No information furnished to the [Arizona Corporation Commission] by a public service corporation, except matters specifically
required to be open to public inspection, shall be open to public inspection or made public except on order of the commission . . . or
by the commission or a commissioner in the course of a hearing or
proceeding.” A.R.S. § 40-204I. A plan for constructing a new plant
in Arizona “is not open to public inspection and shall not be made
public if disclosure of the information in the plan could give a material
advantage to competitors.” A.R.S. § 40-360.02(D).
Schedules containing rates that are filed with the commission are
open for public inspection. A.R.S. §§ 40-365, 40-367(B).
A.R.S. § 27-522(B) provides that records of an oil or gas well drilled
in unproven territory shall be confidential for one year after completion of the drilling.
Q. Real estate appraisals, negotiations.
No case law.
1.

Appraisals.

No case law.
2.

Negotiations.

No case law.
3.

Transactions.

Public notice, which includes the legal description, must be provided of all proposed sales and exchanges of state lands. A.R.S. §§
37-237, 37-604I(7). In addition, all purchase offers for real property
being disposed of by a state agency are public. A.R.S. § 37-803(B)(2).
Information submitted by lessees of state lands to the state land department is confidential and not subject to public inspection, unless it
pertains to the land. A.R.S. §37-282.
R. School and university records.
The Public Records Law governs access to athletic, trustee and student records generally.
Access to certain educational records is controlled by federal law.
A.R.S. § 15-141.
Some assessment and investigation records are specifically exempt
from the Public Records Law.
A.R.S. §§ 15-350(A) and (B) provide that the Board of Education’s
records from an immoral or unprofessional conduct investigation are
“confidential and are not a public record.” However, the board can
provide these records to the school that currently employs that individual.

Page 7

Arizona

Open Government Guide

A.R.S. § 15-537(G) provides that “assessment and evaluation reports of a certificated teacher . . . are confidential [and] do not constitute a public record . . . .” However, these records can be revealed
to the certificated teacher or in an official proceeding regarding that
individual’s employment.
§ 15-551(A), (C) provide that the identity of any student who participates in a hearing regarding the discipline or dismissal of a teacher
will be kept confidential.
In Arizona Board of Regents v. Phoenix Newspapers Inc., the court drew
a distinction between a “prospect,” whose name was not subject to disclosure, and a “candidate,” whose was. The court stated that “the public’s interest in ensuring the state’s ability to secure the most qualified
candidates for the university president’s position is more compelling
than its interest in, or need to know, the names of all of the prospects,”
but held that releasing the names of the 17 final candidates served
“the public’s legitimate interest” and thus outweighed the candidates’
countervailing interests of privacy and confidentiality. 167 Ariz. 254,
258, 806 P.2d 348, 352.
“The right to inspect and review educational records and the release
of or access to these records, other information or instructional materials is governed by federal law in the family educational and privacy
rights act of 1974 . . . and federal regulations issued pursuant to such
act.” A.R.S. § 15-141(A). The Family Educational Rights and Privacy
Act of 1974 (“FERPA”) and associated regulations only permit disclosure of educational records with written parental consent, to comply
with a judicial order, or pursuant to a lawfully issued subpoena. See
Catrone v. Miles, 215 Ariz. 446, 452-53, 160 P.3d 1204, 1210-11 (Ct.
App. 2007) (citing 20 U.S.C. § 1232g (2000 & Supp. 2006) and 34
C.F.R. § 99.31(a)(9)(i) (July 1, 2006 and Oct. 13, 2006)).
3.

Student records.

Student records are not public records. See Congress Elementary Sch.
Dist. No. 17 of Yavapai County v. Warren, 2011 WL 1206192, at *1 n.2
(Ct. App. Mar. 31, 2011).
4.

Other.

A.R.S. § 15-746 provides that additional copies of school report
cards, which include (among other things) a summary of the student
results, the school’s current expenditures, the attendance rate, law enforcement contacts, and percentage of students graduating to the next
level or from high school, “shall be available on request.”
The following university records are exempt from the Arizona Public Records Law: (1) intellectual property or trade secrets, (2) historical records or materials, if restricted access was a condition of donation, and (3) records pertaining to donors or potential donors, other
than the name, description, date, amount, and condition of donations.
A.R.S. § 15-1640.
S.

Vital statistics.

Vital records are confidential and can only be disclosed in accordance with the statute. A.R.S. § 36-342; see Schoeneweis, 223 Ariz. at
174-75, 221 P.3d at 53-54 (determining that death certificates cannot
be released to the general public). A “vital record” is defined as either
“a registered birth certificate or a registered death certificate.” A.R.S.
§ 36-301(33).
V.

PROCEDURE FOR OBTAINING RECORDS
A.

2.

Does the law cover oral requests?
a.

Arrangements to inspect & copy.

The Arizona Public Records Law no longer requires the submission
of a written request for “non-commercial” matters.
b.

If an oral request is denied:

If a request is denied, the person should submit a written request for
access to the documents to the head of the applicable agency.
3.

Contents of a written request.

The request should be drafted narrowly, identifying the documents
to be inspected with as precisely as possible.
d.

Can the request be for future records?

A person may make “an ongoing request for disclosure of a narrowly defined, clearly identifiable category of to-be-created [public
records].” West Valley View, Inc. v. Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office, 216
Ariz. 225, 229, 165 P.3d 203, 207 (Ct. App. 2007) (future press releases).
B.

How long to wait.

Since the Arizona Public Records Law mandates that “[p]ublic records and other matters in the custody of any officer shall be open
to inspection by any person at all times during office hours,” the law
creates a presumption in favor of immediate access to the documents.
A.R.S. § 39-121. A.R.S. § 39-121.01(E) also provides that “[a]ccess
to a public records is deemed denied if a custodian fails to promptly
respond to a request for production of a public record.”
“Although Arizona law requires that the documents be promptly
furnished, it does not specify a specific number of days from the request
by which time a public body must furnish the documents.” Phoenix
New Times, 217 Ariz. at 538, 177 P.3d at 280. Courts, therefore, have
relied on a dictionary definition of “promptly” to require that public
records be produced “at once or without delay.” West Valley View, 216
Ariz. at 230, 165 P.3d at 208. But they recognize that “whether a government agency’s response to a wide variety of document requests was
sufficiently prompt will ultimately be dependent upon the facts and
circumstances of each request.” Phoenix New Times, 217 Ariz. at 538,
177 P.3d at 280 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); but
see id. at 541, 177 P.3d at 283 (noting that “evidence of inattentiveness
on the part of the public body does not establish the promptness of a
response”). Some requests will require more time for the custodian to
locate the records or to review and determine whether certain information should be deleted from them.
3.

Is delay recognized as a denial for appeal
purposes?

Yes. See Phoenix New Times, 217 Ariz. at 538, 177 P.3d at 280 (stating the failure to promptly produce records in response to a request
constitutes a denial of access to public records and gives the superior
court discretion to award attorneys’ fees).
C. Administrative appeal.
There is no requirement that an administrative appeal be submitted
prior to the initiation of a lawsuit.

How to start.

2.

To whom is an appeal directed?

1.

4.

Contents of appeal letter.

Who receives a request?

Requests to inspect public records should be directed to the public “officer” who maintains custody of the documents. While some
agencies may have freedom of information officers assigned to disclosure requests, it is advisable also to direct such requests to the “person
elected or appointed to hold any elective or appointive office of any
public body and any chief administrative officer, head, director, superPage 8

intendent or chairman of any public body.” A.R.S. § 39-121.01(A)(1).

D. Court action.
1.

Who may sue?

“Any person who has requested to examine or copy public records
pursuant to this article, and who has been denied access to or the right
to copy such records, may appeal the denial through a special action
The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press

Open Government Guide
in the superior court, pursuant to the rules of procedure for special
actions against the officer or public body.” A.R.S. § 39-121.02(A).
9.

Litigation expenses.
a.

Attorney fees.

Before it was amended in 2006, A.R.S. § 39-121.02(B) provided for
an award of attorneys’ fees against the records custodian if the custodian’s actions were “arbitrary, capricious, or in bad faith.” The current
statute provides that “[t]he court may award attorney fees and other
legal costs that are reasonably incurred in any action under this article if the person seeking public records has substantially prevailed.”
A.R.S. § 39-121.02(B). Accordingly, attorneys’ fees and costs can now
be assessed against any non-prevailing party. Arpaio v. Citizen Publ’g
Co., 221 Ariz. 130, 133, 211 P.3d 8, 11 (Ct. App. 2008). Specifically,
the statute “does not prohibit a trial court from requiring a party other
than the custodian of the requested records to pay attorney fees to the
prevailing party. The trial court may require parties adverse to the
requesting party to pay that party’s attorney fees if the requesting party
substantially prevails.” Id. at 134, 211 P.3d at 12.
11. Other penalties.
If wrongfully denied access to public records, the person also “has
a cause of action against the officer or public body for any damages
resulting from the denial.” A.R.S. § 39-121.02(C) (emphasis added).
E.

Appealing initial court decisions.

Pursuant to the rules governing special actions in Arizona, the denial of access through a special action may be pursued in the Court of
Appeals or the Arizona Supreme Court in appropriate circumstances.
The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press often files amicus briefs in cases involving significant media law issues before a state’s
highest court.

Arizona

Open Meetings
I.

STATUTE — BASIC APPLICATION.
A.

Who may attend?

“All persons so desiring shall be permitted to attend and listen to
the deliberations and proceedings” of any public meeting. A.R.S. §
38-431.01(A). The Open Meetings Law (“OML”), however, does not
provide for active public participation in the meeting. Ariz. Att’y Gen.
Op. Nos. I84-133, I83-49.
Meetings may not be conducted in a language (e.g., Navajo) if its
use prevents the public from understanding the business of the meeting. Ariz. Att’y Gen. Op. No. I84-133.
B.

What governments are subject to the law?

The OML applies to the state as well as “all political subdivisions of the
state” which includes without limitation “all counties, cities and towns,
school districts and special districts.” A.R.S. § 38-431(5).
C. What bodies are covered by the law?
The Arizona OML applies to “any public body.” A.R.S. § 38431.01(A).
“Public body” is defined as
the legislature, all boards and commissions of this state
or political subdivisions, all multimember governing bodies
of departments, agencies, institutions and instrumentalities of the state or political subdivisions, including without
limitation all corporations and other instrumentalities whose
boards of directors are appointed or elected by the state or
political subdivision. Public body includes all quasi-judicial
bodies and all standing, special or advisory committees or
subcommittees of, or appointed by, the public body.
A.R.S. § 38-431(6). What constitutes a “public body” is fairly expansive and may turn on unique facts or circumstances. For example,
what constitutes “institutions and instrumentalities of the state or political subdivision” might depend heavily on the relationship between
the body and the political subdivision.
1.

Executive branch agencies.

Agencies headed by a single director are not subject to the OML because there is no multi-member body making decisions. Decisions are
made by the director or Governor. See Ariz. Att’y Gen. Op. No. 75-7.
But if the Governor or agency head appoints a committee or board
(see A.R.S. § 38-431(1)), there is debate as to whether any meeting by
that body is a public meeting. See Ariz. Att’y Gen. Op. No. 75-7. Attorney General Opinions conflict on this issue. Compare Ariz. Att’y
Gen. Op. No. I90-013 (advisory committee appointed by Governor
subject to OML) with Ariz. Att’y Gen. Op. No. I92-007 (advisory
committee appointed by Governor not subject to OML).
2.

Legislative bodies.

The OML generally applies to the Legislature. A.R.S. § 38-431(6).
But the OML does not apply to any “political caucus”—i.e., the consideration of party policy with respect to a particular legislative issue without reaching a collective decision, promise or commitment.
A.R.S. § 38-431.08(A)(1). Attorney General Opinions conflict on this
issue. Compare Ariz. Att’y Gen. Op. No. I90-013 (advisory committee
appointed by Governor subject to OML) with Ariz. Att’y Gen. Op.
No. I92-007 (advisory committee appointed by Governor not subject
to OML).
Conference committees of the legislature must be open to the public but need not follow the notice and minute requirements of the
OML. A.R.S. § 38-431.08(A)(2).
The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press

3.

Courts.

Judicial proceedings are not covered by the OML. A.R.S. § 38431.08(A)(1).
4.

Nongovernmental bodies receiving public funds or
benefits.

Arizona does not tie receipt of public funds directly to applicability
of the OML.
5.

Nongovernmental groups whose members include
governmental officials.

The OML may apply depending on a variety of factors such as (a)
the group’s function or (b’ who appointed the members and how they
were appointed.
6.

Advisory boards and commissions, quasigovernmental entities.

The OML applies to “all standing, special or advisory committees
or subcommittees of, or appointed by, such public body.” A.R.S. §
38-431(6).
The OML also applies to committees even if the committee members are not members of the public body. Ariz. Att’y Gen. Op. No.
I80-202. “Advisory committees” are defined as “any entity, however
designated, that is officially established, on motion and order of a
public body or by the presiding officer of the public body, and whose
members have been appointed for the specific purpose of making a
recommendation concerning a decision to be made or considered or
a course of conduct to be taken or considered by the public body.”
A.R.S. § 38-431(1).
OML applies to a quasi-judicial body, which is “a public body, other
than a court of law, possessing the power to hold hearings on disputed
matters between a private person and a public agency and to make
decisions in the general manner of a court regarding such disputed
claims.” A.R.S. § 38-431(7).
8.

Other bodies to which governmental or public
functions are delegated.

“Institutions” or “instrumentalities” of a public body, including
without limitation “all corporations and other instrumentalities whose
boards of directors are appointed or elected by the state or political
subdivision” are subject to the OML. A.R.S. § 38-431(6) (emphasis
added). To be an “institution,” the entity must be “a creation of the
law itself, . . . rather [than] the creation of a group of private individuals acting together as authorized by Arizona’s statutes . . . .” Prescott
Newspapers, Inc. v. Yavapai Cmty. Hosp. Ass’n, 163 Ariz. 33,’39, 785 P.2d
1221, 1227 (Ct. App. 1989). An “instrumentality” must be “something that serves as an intermediary or agent through which one or
more functions of a controlling force are carried out: a part, organ
or subsidiary branch esp. of a governing body.” Id. (quoting Webster’s
Third New International Dictionary 1172); see Ariz. Att’y Gen. Op. No.
I07-001 (finding the Board of Trustees appointed to administer the
Northern Arizona Employees Benefits Trust is an instrumentality of
the participating political subdivisions and therefore falls within the
definition of a public body).                                                                                               
9.

Appointed as well as elected bodies.

As long as they fall within the definition of a public body, both appointed and elected bodies must comply with the OML. For example,
the OML applies to the Finance Committee of the Board of Regents,
Ariz. Att’y Gen. Op. No. I78-285, as well as the board of trustees of an
employees’ benefit-trust created by a school district board, Ariz. Att’y
Gen. Op. No. I83-18.
Page 10

“All meetings” of public bodies, including “deliberations and proceedings,” are subject to the OML. A.R.S. § 38-431.01(A). But “a
communication with the media that may [subsequently] reach a quorum of the board’s members is not a ‘gathering’ of the public body,
and, for that reason, it is not a meeting.” Ariz. Att’y Gen. Op. No.
I07-013.
1.

Number that must be present.

“Meeting” is defined as “the gathering, in person or through technological devices, of a quorum of members of a public body at which
they discuss, propose or take legal action, including any deliberations
by a quorum with respect to such action.” A.R.S. § 38-431(4).
a.

Multi-state or regional bodies.

The OML may apply depending on a variety of factors such as (a)
the group’s function or (b’ who appointed the members and how they
were appointed.
7.

D. What constitutes a meeting subject to the law.

Must a minimum number be present to
constitute a “meeting”?

”es. The OML does not apply if a quorum is not present.
b.

What effect does absence of a quorum have?

Discussions and deliberations between less than a quorum, when
used to circumvent the purposes of the OML, would constitute a violation of the OML. Ariz. Att’y Gen. Op. No. 75-8.
2.

Nature of business subject to the law.
a.

“Information gathering” and “fact-finding”
sessions.

“Information gathering” and “fact-finding” sessions may be covered
by the OML if they would foreseeably aid in or require a decision by
the body (i.e. constitute a “deliberation”). Ariz. Att’y Gen. Op. No.
75-8.
b.

Deliberations toward decisions.

“Deliberations” are expressly included. A.R.S. §§ 38-431(4); 38431.01(A).
3.

Electronic meetings.

A “meeting” may occur in person or by using technological devices.
A.R.S. § 38-431(4).
a.

Conference calls and video/Internet
conferencing.

A meeting for purposes of the OML also may occur by telephone or
video conferencing. See Ariz. Att’y Gen. Op. I91-033.
b.

E-mail.

“When members of the public body are parties to an exchange of
e-mail communications that involve discussions, deliberations or taking legal action by a quorum of the public body concerning a matter
that may foreseeably come before the public body for action, the communications constitute a meeting through technological devices under
the OML.” Ariz. Att’y Gen. Op. I05-004.
c.

Text messages.

The same reasoning that applies to email communications in Section I(D)(3)(b) above would apply to text messages as well.
d.

Instant messaging.

The same reasoning that applies to email communications in Section I(D)(3)(b) above would apply to instant messages as well.
e.

Social media and online discussion boards.

The same reasoning that applies to email communications in Section I(D)(3)(b) above would apply to social media and online discussion boards as well.

Categories of meetings subject to the law.
1.

Regular meetings.
a.

Definition.

As noted above, “meeting” means “the gathering, in person or
through technological devices, of a quorum of members of a public
body at which they discuss, propose or take legal action, including
any deliberations by a quorum with respect to such action.” A.R.S. §
38-431(4).
b.

Notice.
(1). Time limit for giving notice.

Other than an actual emergency, the notice of a meeting must be
posted at least 24 hours in advance. A.R.S. § 38-431.02(C). “The
twenty-four hour period includes Saturdays if the public has access
to the physical posted location in addition to any website posting, but
excludes Sundays and other holidays prescribed in section 1-301.” Id.
A meeting can be recessed and resumed with less notice than 24
hours if proper notice of meeting had been given and, if prior to recessing, “notice is publicly given as to the time and place of the resumption of the meeting or the method by which notice shall be publicly given.” A.R.S. § 38-431.02(E).
“A public body that intends to meet for a specified calendar period,
on a regular day, date or event during the calendar period, and at a
regular place and time, may post public notice of the meetings at the
beginning of the period.” A.R.S. § 38-431.02(F).
(2). To whom notice is given.
Notice must be given to members of the public body and the general public. A.R.S. § 38-431.02(C).
(3). Where posted.
Notice for most public bodies must be provided as follows:
(a) Conspicuously post a statement on their website stating where
all public notices of their meetings will be posted, including the
physical and electronic locations, and shall give additional public
notice as is reasonable and practicable as to all meetings.
(b) Post all public meeting notices on their website and give additional public notice as is reasonable and practicable to all meetings. A technological problem or failure that either prevents
the posting of public notices on a website or that temporarily or
permanently prevents the use of all or part of the website does
not preclude the holding of the meeting for which the notice was
posted if the public body complies with all other public notice
requirements required by this section.
A.R.S. § 38-431.02(A)(1), (2), and (4). Special districts formed pursuant to title 48 may comply with these requirements. A.R.S. § 38431.02(A)(3).
(4). Public agenda items required.
Notice “shall include an agenda of the matters to be discussed or
decided at the meeting or information on how the public may obtain a
copy of such an agenda.” A.R.S. § 38-431.02(G).
Agendas “shall list the specific matters to be discussed, considered
or decided at the meeting.” A.R.S. § 38-431.02(H). They must be
available at least 24 hours before the meeting except in the case of an
actual emergency. A.R.S. § 38-431.02(G).
Public bodies may only discuss, consider or decide those “matters
listed on the agenda and other matters related thereto.” A.R.S. § 38431.02(H). Nothing can be added to an agenda once a meeting has
begun, not even by a majority vote of the public body (except in the
case of an actual emergency). Ariz. Att’y Gen. Op. No. I79-192.

The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press

Arizona
In cases of actual emergencies, however, matters not listed on the
agenda can be discussed, considered, and decided at the public meeting. A.R.S. § 38-431.02(J). Moreover, the presiding officer or a member of the public body may summarize current events without listing
the specific matters on the agenda, provided the summary is listed and
the public body does not discuss or take legal action on any matter not
properly noticed. A.R.S. § 38-431.02(H). In addition, public bodies also may make open calls to the public to discuss matters that fall
within their jurisdiction. A.R.S. § 38-431.01(H).
(5). Other information required in notice.
None.
(6). Penalties and remedies for failure to give
adequate notice.
Other than challenges to the validity of executive sessions, “the burden of proving a violation of the open meeting law generally is on the
party asserting the violation.” City of Prescott, 166 Ariz. at 486 n.4, 803
P.2d at 897 n.4.
a. Penalties:
Arizona law provides for penalties for failure to comply with Notice
and Agenda Requirements.
“All legal action transacted by any public body during a meeting
held in violation of any provision of [the OML] is null and void” unless
properly ratified by the public body. A.R.S. § 38-431.05(A) (emphasis
added); see Cooper v. Ariz. W. College Dist. Governing Bd., 125 Ariz. 463,
610 P.2d 465 (Ct. App. 1980); Ariz. Att’y Gen. Op. No. I79-45; but see
Ariz. Att’y Gen Op. No. I80-001 (determining that “a violation of the
OML during the meeting with respect to a single agenda item does
not render all legal action taken with respect to other agenda items
null and void”).
A technical violation or a “minor deviation,” however, will not nullify all business undertaken at a meeting when there is no demonstrated
prejudicial effect on the complaining party and the meeting complies
with the intent of OML. Karol v. Bd. of Educ. Trustees., 122 Ariz. 95,
98, 593 P.2d 649, 652 (1979); see Ahnert v. Sunnyside Unified Sch. Dist.
No. 12, 126 Ariz. 473, 475, 616 P.2d 933, 935 (Ct. App. 1980). In addition, a matter that was inappropriately decided at an executive session
may be corrected by a formal vote at a public meeting that complies
with the OML. See Valencia v. Cota, 126 Ariz. 555, 557, 617 P.2d 63,
65 (Ct. App. 1980).
For any violation of the OML, the court may (1) award attorneys’
fees and costs in favor of plaintiff and against the public body, (2) impose up to $500 in civil penalties against the person violating or knowingly aiding, agreeing to aid, or attempting to aid in the violation of
the OML, and (3) remove the offending public officer from office and
assess the officer and/or any person who knowingly aids, agrees to aid,
or attempts to aid the officer with all costs and attorneys’ fees awarded
to the plaintiff. A.R.S. § 38-431.07(A).
b. Ratification of actions done in violation of open meetings
law:
Legal actions violating OML are usually null and void. A.R.S. § 38431.05(A); see, e.g., Thurston v. City of Phoenix, 157 Ariz. 343, 345, 757
P.2d 619, 621 (Ct. App. 1988) (voiding otherwise lawful action taken
by the city because the action was not on the meeting’s agenda).
A public body, however, may ratify any legal action taken in violation of the OML by complying with the following requirements:
1.   Ratification shall take place at a public meeting within
thirty days after discovery of the violation or after such discovery should have been made by the exercise of reasonable
diligence.
2.   The notice for the meeting shall include a description
of the action to be ratified, a clear statement that the public
Page 11

Arizona

Open Government Guide
body proposes to ratify a prior action and information on
how the public may obtain a detailed written description of
the action to be ratified.
3.   The public body shall make available to the public a
detailed written description of the action to be ratified and
all deliberations, consultations and decisions by members of
the public body that preceded and related to such action.
The written description shall also be included as part of the
minutes of the meeting at which ratification is taken.
4.   The public body shall make available to the public
the notice and detailed written description required by this
section at least seventy-two hours in advance of the public
meeting at which the ratification is taken.

A.R.S. § 38-431.05(B). A judicial determination that the public
body took legal action in violation of the OML triggers the 30-day
period for ratification. See Tanque Verde Unified Sch. Dist. No. 13 of
Pima County v. Bernini, 206 Ariz. 200, 208-10, 76 P.3d 874, 882-84
(Ct. App. 2003).
c.

Minutes.

“All public bodies shall provide for the taking of written minutes or
a recording of all their meetings, including executive sessions.” A.R.S.
§ 38-431.01(B).
(1). Information required.
Minutes for regular meetings, not including executive sessions,
must include at least:
1.   The date, time and place of the meeting.
2.   The members of the public body recorded as either present
or absent.
3.   A general description of the matters considered.
4.   An accurate description of all legal actions proposed, discussed
or taken, and the names of members who propose each motion.
The minutes shall also include the names of the persons, as given,
making statements or presenting material to the public body and
a reference to the legal action about which they made statements
or presented material.
A.R.S. § 38-431.01(B). Minutes must be sufficiently detailed to comply with statute but verbatim transcripts are not necessary. Ariz. Att’y
Gen. Op. No. I83-6.
(2). Are minutes public record?

Special or emergency meetings.
a.

Definition.

Emergency meetings require an “actual emergency.” A.R.S. § 38431.02(D), (J). The Arizona Court of Appeals requires that the emergency be “real” and “existing in fact,” not “nominal” or “‘constructive’ or merely ‘possible’ or ‘conceivable.’” Carefree Improvement Ass’n
v. City of Scottsdale, 133 Ariz. 106, 113, 649 P.2d 985, 992 (Ct. App.
1982). An “emergency” is “an unforeseen combination of circumstances which call for immediate action.” Id.
Emergency executive sessions may also be held.
431.02(D).
b.

Page 12

Notice requirements.

In the case of an actual emergency, the meeting “may be held on such
notice as is appropriate to the circumstance.” A.R.S. § 38-431.02(D).
But if an emergency session is conducted at a previously scheduled
meeting, “the public body must post a public notice within twentyfour hours declaring that an emergency session has been held.” Id.
(2). To whom notice is given.
The public body must provide public notice that the emergency
session was held. A.R.S. § 38-431.02(D).
(3). Where posted.
This public notice must be properly posted (like a notice for a regular meeting) and must include an agenda or, if an executive session, a
general description of the matters considered. A.R.S. § 38-431.02(A),
(D), (H), (I).
(4). Public agenda items required.
The agenda for an emergency meeting must include the same
information as required for a regular meeting agenda. A.R.S. § 38431.02(D), (H).
c.

Minutes.

Minutes must be taken for an emergency meeting. A.R.S. § 38431.01(B).
(1). Information required.
Minutes must also include a statement setting forth the reasons why
the emergency meeting was necessary. A.R.S. § 38-431.02(J).
(2). Are minutes a public record?
Yes. See A.R.S. § 38-431.01(D).
3.

Closed meetings or executive sessions.

The public may be excluded from executive sessions. See A.R.S. §
38-431(2) (defining “executive session” as “a gathering of a quorum of
members of a public body from which the public is excluded for one
or more of the reasons prescribed in section 38-431.01.”). In addition
to members of the public body, specific employees and appointees, and
the auditor general, “only individuals whose presence is reasonably
necessary in order for the public body to carry out its executive session
responsibilities may attend the executive session.” Id.
a.

Definition.

Executive sessions may only be hold for the following purposes:

“The minutes or a recording of a meeting shall be available for
public inspection three working days after the meeting, except as otherwise specifically provided by this article.” A.R.S. § 38-431.01(D);
see A.R.S. § 38-431.01(E) (providing specific time requirements for
public bodies of cities and towns with populations of more than 2,500
persons).
2.

(1). Time limit for giving notice.

A.R.S. § 38-

1.   Discussion or consideration of employment, assignment, appointment, promotion, demotion, dismissal, salaries, disciplining
or resignation of a public officer, appointee or employee of any
public body, except that, with the exception of salary discussions,
an officer, appointee or employee may demand that the discussion or consideration occur at a public meeting. . . .
2.   Discussion or consideration of records exempt by law from
public inspection, including the receipt and discussion of information or testimony that is specifically required to be maintained
as confidential by state or federal law.
3.   Discussion or consultation for legal advice with the attorney
or attorneys of the public body.
4.   Discussion or consultation with the attorneys of the public
body in order to consider its position and instruct its attorneys
regarding the public body’s position regarding contracts that are
the subject of negotiations, in pending or contemplated litigation or in settlement discussions conducted in order to avoid or
resolve litigation.
5.   Discussions or consultations with designated representatives

of the public body in order to consider its position and instruct
its representatives regarding negotiations with employee organizations regarding the salaries, salary schedules or compensation
paid in the form of fringe benefits of employees of the public
body.

cessing, “notice is publicly given as to the time and place of the resumption of the meeting or the method by which notice shall be publicly given.” A.R.S. § 38-431.02(E).

6.   Discussion, consultation or consideration for international
and interstate negotiations or for negotiations by a city or town,
or its designated representatives, with members of a tribal council, or its designated representatives, of an Indian reservation located within or adjacent to the city or town.

Notice of executive sessions must be given to the members of the
public body and the general public. A.R.S. § 38-431.02(B).

7.   Discussions or consultations with designated representatives
of the public body in order to consider its position and instruct
its representatives regarding negotiations for the purchase, sale or
lease of real property.
A.R.S. § 38-431.03(A); see City of Prescott, 166 Ariz. at 483, 803 P.2d
at 894 (“This section is intended to establish an equilibrium between
the public’s desire for access and the governmental agency’s need to
act in private, short of reaching a collective decision, commitment
or promise.”) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); see also
Shelby Sch. v. Ariz. State Bd. of Educ., 192 Ariz. 156, 167, 962 P.2d 230,
241 (Ct. App. 1998) (determining that the board appropriately deliberated over confidential credit records in an executive session).
When the validity of an executive session is challenged, the burden
shifts to the public body to prove that the executive session did not
violate the OML. Fisher v. Maricopa County Stadium Dist., 185 Ariz.
116, 122, 912 P.2d 1345, 1351 (Ct. App. 1995).
“Legal action involving a final vote or decisions shall not be taken at
an executive session, but the public body may instruct its attorneys or
representatives as provided in subsection A, paragraphs 4, 5 and 7 of
this section.” A.R.S. § 38-431.03(D). A public body cannot hold an
executive session merely because its attorney is present if the discussion is not for legal advice. City of Prescott, 166 Ariz. at 485, 803 P.2d at
896. [A] consultation between a governmental entity and its attorney
for legal advice is not legal action involving a final vote or decision,
and . . . a governmental entity may therefore meet in executive session with its attorney to receive legal advice.” Id. “However, once the
members of the public body commence any discussion regarding the
merits of enacting the legislation or what action to take based upon
the attorney’s advice, the discussion moves beyond the realm of legal
advice and must be open to the public.” Id. at 486, 803 P.2d at 897;
see Fisher, 185 Ariz. at 124, 912 P.2d at 1353 (“It is the debate over
what action to take, including the pros and cons and policy implications, of competing alternative courses of action, that must take place
in public.”).
b.

Notice requirements.

“[N]otice of executive sessions shall be required to include only
a general description of the matters to be considered.” A.R.S. § 38431.02(I). In Shelby Sch., the court found that a motion containing
broad language similar to A.R.S. § 38-431.03(A)(2) and (3) satisfied
the notice requirements of A.R.S. § 38-431.02(I). 192 Ariz. at 16768, 962 P.2d at 241-42. Except for cases of actual emergencies, “a
public body shall not discuss any matter in an executive session which
is not described in the notice of the executive session.” A.R.S. § 38431.03(E).
(1). Time limit for giving notice.
Other than an actual emergency, the notice of a meeting must be
posted at least 24 hours in advance. A.R.S. § 38-431.02(C). “The
twenty-four hour period includes Saturdays if the public has access
to the physical posted location in addition to any website posting, but
excludes Sundays and other holidays prescribed in section 1-301.” Id.
A meeting can be recessed and resumed with less notice than 24
hours if proper notice of meeting had been given and, if prior to re-

(2). To whom notice is given.

(3). Where posted.
The same posting requirements as for regular meetings must be followed for executive sessions. A.R.S. § 38-431.02(A).
(4). Public agenda items required.
An agenda is also required for an executive session and must “provide more than just a recital of the statutory provisions authorizing
the executive session, but need not contain information that would
defeat the purpose of the executive session, compromise the legitimate
privacy interests of a public officer, appointee or employee or compromise the attorney-client privilege.” A.R.S. § 38-431.02(I).
(5). Other information required in notice.
The notice must include “the provision of law authorizing the executive session.” A.R.S. § 38-431.02(B).
c.

Minutes.

Written minutes or a recording of the session are required for all
executive sessions by public bodies. A.R.S. § 38-431.01(B). But these
minutes, as well as any discussions, are confidential subject to specific
exemptions. A.R.S. § 38-431.03(B).
(1). Information required.
Executive session minutes must include the following:
1.   The date, time and place of the meeting.
2.   The members of the public body recorded as either present or absent.
3.   A general description of the matters considered.
A.R.S. § 38-431.01(B). In addition, the minutes must provide “an
accurate description of instructions given” to its attorneys or representatives and “such other matters as may be deemed appropriate by
the public body.” A.R.S. § 38-431.01(C).
(2). Are minutes a public record?
Minutes of executive sessions are kept confidential subject to specific exceptions. A.R.S. § 38-431.03(B). In some instances, however,
“the interest [of] full disclosure warrants the revelation of information
pertinent to [a] decision,” even if the information comes frrm the proceedings of an executive session or might otherwise be confidential.
Shelby Sch., 192 Ariz. at 168, 962 P.2d at 242.
The public body can disclose the minutes to members of the public
body who met in the session, the officers, appointees, or employees
who were the subject of consideration, the auditor general, and the
Attorney General or county attorney who are investigating alleged
violations of the OML. A.R.S. § 38-431.03(B); see Picture Rocks Fire
Dist. v. Updike, 145 Ariz. 79, 81, 699 P.2d 1310, 1312 (Ct. App. 1985)
(Executive session minutes may be given to a member of the public
body who was absent from the executive session.). The disclosure of
executive session information to any of these parties does not waive
any attorney-client privilege. A.R.S. § 38-431.03(F) .
In an action challenging an executive session’s validity, “[a] court
may review in camera the minutes of the executive session, and if the
court in its discretion determines that the minutes are relevant and
that justice so demands, the court may disclose to the parties or admit
in evidence part or all of the minutes.” A.R.S. § 38-431.07(C). “Any

Page 13

Arizona

Open Government Guide

court that reviews executive session information shall take appropriate
action to protect privileged information.” A.R.S. § 38-431.03(F).
d.

Requirement to meet in public before closing
meeting.

A public body may hold an executive session only “upon a public
majority vote of the members constituting a quorum.” A.R.S. § 38431.03(A) (emphasis added); see Shelby Sch., 192 Ariz. at 167, 962 P.2d
at 241 (finding the Board of Education’s deliberations in an executive
session followed by a final decision in an open meeting complied with
the OML).
e.

Requirement to state statutory authority for
closing meetings before closure.

No such requirement.
f.

Tape recording requirements.

There is no requirement that the executive sessions be tape recorded.
F.

Recording/broadcast of meetings.

“All or any part of a public meeting of a public body may be recorded by any person in attendance by means of a tape recorder, camera or
camera or any other means of sonic reproduction, provided that there
is no active interference with the conduct of the meeting.” A.R.S. §
38-431.01(F).
G. Are there sanctions for noncompliance?
For any violation of the OML, the court may (1) award attorneys’
fees and costs in favor of plaintiff and against the public body, (2) impose up to $500 in civil penalties against the person violating or knowingly aiding, agreeing to aid, or attempting to aid in the violation of
the OML, and (3) remove the offending public officer from office and
assess the officer and/or any person who knowingly aids, agrees to aid,
or attempts to aid the officer with all costs and attorneys’ fees awarded
to the plaintiff. A.R.S. § 38-431.07(A). Any assessed civil penalties
will be deposited in the public body’s general fund. Id.

8, Constitution of Arizona, to provide an exemption to the notice and
agenda requirements of [the OML] or to allow standing or conference
committees to meet through technological devices rather than only in
person.” A.R.S. § 38-431.08(D).

12. Meetings of the property and casualty insurance guaranty fund in which any member insurer’s financial condition
is discussed are closed to the public. A.R.S. § 20-671.

The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press

B.

Budget sessions.

C. Business and industry relations.

D. Federal programs.
A public body may hold an executive session about a federal program, if pertaining to a “discussion, consultation or consideration for
international and interstate negotiations.” See A.R.S. § 38-431.03(A)
(6). The provision, however, does not apply to meetings at which the
public body receives recommendations from a federal agency. Ariz.
Att’y Gen. Op. No. I80-159.
E.

Financial data of public bodies.

Such discussions are covered by OML unless the information or
records are “exempt by law from public inspection.” A.R.S. § 38431.03(A)(2).
F.

Financial data, trade secrets or proprietary data of
private corporations and individuals.

Such discussions are covered unless the information or records are

G. Gifts, trusts and honorary degrees.
Discussions by a public body should fall under OML.
H. Grand jury testimony by public employees.

I.

Licensing examinations.

No directly applicable law, but OML should apply to all multimember licensing boards because the examination is a deliberation
with respect to a legal action. See § 38-431(3), (6).
J.

Litigation; pending litigation or other attorney-client
privileges.

Any “[d]iscussion or consultation for legal advice with the attorney
or attorneys of the public body” can be done in closed executive session. A.R.S. § 38-431.03(A)(3); cf. Fisher, 185 Ariz. at 124, 912 P.2d at
1353 (cautioning that permitting “public bodies to delegate responsibilities to attorneys and then cloak negotiations and executive sessions
in secrecy” would frustrate the OML).
Any “[d]iscussion or consultation with the attorneys of the public
body in order to consider its position and instruct attorneys regarding
the public body’s position regarding contracts that are the subject of
negotiations, in pending or contemplated litigation or in settlement
discussions conducted in order to avoid or resolve litigation” may be
conducted in closed executive session. A.R.S. § 38-431.03(A)(4).
But “[a] public vote shall be taken before any legal action binds the
public body.” A.R.S. § 38-431.03(D). In addition, “all legal actions
[must] be preceded . . . by disclosure of that amount of information
sufficient to apprise the public in attendance of the basic subject matter of the action so that the public may scrutinize the action taken

K. Negotiations and collective bargaining of public
employees.
1.

Any sessions regarding collective bargaining.

Negotiations and collective bargaining by at least a quorum of the
public body or by a multi-member committee appointed by the public
body must comply with the OML.
2.

Only those between the public employees and the
public body.

But “[d]iscussions or consultations with designated representatives
of the public body in order to consider its position and instruct its
representatives regarding negotiations with employee organizations
regarding the salaries, salary schedules or compensation paid in the
form of fringe benefits of employees of the public body” may be done
in closed executive sessions. A.R.S. § 38-431.03(A)(5); see Ariz. Att’y
Gen. Op. No. I80-146.
L.

Parole board meetings, or meetings involving parole
board decisions.

They are subject to OML. When meetings are held within a prison
facility, however, the director of the department of corrections may
restrict access in the following ways:

representatives regarding negotiations for the purchase, sale or lease
of real property” may occur in closed executive sessions. A.R.S. §
38-431.03(A)(7). Although it cannot select the construction site in
a closed session, a public body may “discuss its position in executive
session before it actually commences negotiating with a land owner or
purchaser.” Tanque Verde Unified Sch. Dist., 206 Ariz. at 208, 76 P.3d
at 882.
The actual negotiations may or may not be conducted in public
meetings, depending on the entity negotiating on behalf of the public
body (i.e., multimember special committee versus single-person attorney or representative).
P.

Security, national and/or state, of buildings, personnel
or other.

Not expressly exempted from open meetings by any Arizona statute.
Q. Students; discussions on individual students.
Curriculum discussions must be done in open meeting. Ariz. Att’y
Gen. Op. No. I81-060.
See also Section II.B.1, supra.
IV. PROCEDURE FOR ASSERTING RIGHT OF ACCESS
A.

When to challenge.

1. Prohibit, on written findings that are made public within five
days of so finding, any person from attending a hearing whose
attendance would constitute a serious threat to the life or physical
safety of any person or to the safe, secure and orderly operation
of the prison.

Arizona’s OML allows legal challenges both before a violation will
occur and after a violation has occurred.

2. Require a person who attends a hearing to sign an attendance
log. If the person is over sixteen years of age, the person shall
produce photographic identification which verifies the person’s
signature.

A person may bring an action “for the purposes of requiring compliance with, or the prevention of violations of, [the OML] . . . or to
determine the applicability of [the OML] to matters or legal actions of
the public body.” A.R.S. § 38-431.07(A).

3. Prevent and prohibit any articles from being taken into a hearing except recording devices, and if the person who attends a
hearing is a member of the media, cameras.

A person also may seek a writ of mandamus ordering future compliance with the OML if potential violations seem likely. A.R.S. § 38431.04. This is now done through a procedure known as a statutory
special action. See Arizona Rules of Procedure for Special Actions.

4. Require that a person who attends a hearing submit to a reasonable search on entering the facility.
A.R.S. § 38-431.08(B).

Before violation:

After violation: A.R.S. § 38-431.07(A) provides for actions against
public bodies and their members who have violated the OML.
1.

M. Patients; discussions on individual patients.
Arizona statutes do not specifically exempt from OML requirements
any discussions about patients. Many types of medical records, however, are exempt from public inspection. E.g., A.R.S. § 12-2292A.R.S
(“Unless otherwise provided by law, all medical records . . . are privileged and confidential.”). Moreover, discussion or consideration of
records exempt from public inspection may occur in executive session.
A.R.S. § 38-431.03(A)(2).
N. Personnel matters.
A public body may consider in closed executive session any “[d]iscussion or consideration of employment, assignment, appointment,
promotion, demotion, dismissal, salaries, disciplining or resignation
of a public officer, appointee or employee of any public body, except
that, with the exception of salary discussions, an officer, appointee or
employee may demand that the discussion or consideration should occur at a public meeting.” A.R.S. § 38-431.03(A)(1).
Any other personnel matter discussed by a public body should be
done in an open meeting. For example, the formulation of the intention to contract or not to contract with employees must be taken at a
public meeting. See Ahnert, 126 Ariz. at 475, 616 P.2d at 935; Karol,
122 Ariz. at 96-97, 593 P.2d at 650-51.
O. Real estate negotiations.
Any “[d]iscussions or consultations with designated representatives
of the public body in order to consider its position and instruct its
Page 16

Does the law provide expedited procedure for
reviewing request to attend upcoming meetings?

The OML does not contain any express expedited procedures for
reviewing OML actions, but a special statutory action combined with
a request for a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction
would expedite the procedure.
B.

How to start.

The OML expressly provides that an action may be brought in
“the superior court in the county in which the public body ordinarily
meets.” A.R.S. § 38-431.07(A).
No Arizona statute requires or provides for administrative proceedings for resolving OML violations.
1.

Where to ask for ruling.
a. Administrative forum.
C. Court review of administrative decision.
1. Who may sue?
An action may be brought by (1) any person affected by an alleged
violation of the OML, (2) the Arizona attorney general, (3) or the
county attorney for the county in which the alleged violation occurred. A.R.S. § 38-431.07(A).
2.

Will the court give priority to the pleading?

The OML does not contain any express expedited procedures for
reviewing OML actions. Combining the special action with a request
The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press

Open Government Guide
for a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction will expedite the procedure.
3.

Pro se possibility, advisability.

Due to procedural complexities of the special action and the technical nature of the OML, pro se plaintiffs may run into difficulty.
4.

Pleading format.

Special action: This type of action is now the proper procedure
to obtain relief previously obtained by writs of certiorari, mandamus
or prohibition. See Rules of Procedure for Special Actions (Ariz.
R.P.S.A.).
Special actions regarding OML typically involve situations where
the public body has failed to perform a duty required by law as to
which it has no discretion. Ariz. R.P.S.A. 3(a).
Declaratory judgment action: Occasionally such actions are
brought by a public body to resolve its duties under the OML. See
Ariz. R. Civ. P. 57.
6.

Time limit for filing suit.

See Ariz. R.P.S.A 4(c).
7.

What court.

An action may be brought in “the superior court in the county in
which the public body ordinarily meets.” A.R.S. § 38-431.07(A).
8.

Judicial remedies available.

Courts have wide-ranging powers to ensure compliance with the
OML. A.R.S. § 38-431.09 states that “any person or entity charged
with the interpretations of [the OML] shall construe [the OML] in favor of open and public meetings.” See Carefree Improvement Ass’n, 133
Ariz. at 107, 649 P.2d at 986 (noting that, “[i]n construing the open
meeting law and the declaration of policy, the language must be liberally construed to effect their objects and to promote justice”) (citation
and internal quotation marks omitted).
9.

11. Other penalties.
The Court has discretion to remove a public officer from office if
it “determines that a public officer with intent to deprive the public
of information violated any provision of [the OML].” A.R.S. § 38431.07(A).
D. Appealing initial court decisions.

What issues will the court address?

A court may (1) require a public body and its members comply with
OML; (2) prohibit a public body and its members from violating the
OML; (3) determine the applicability of the OML to matters or legal
actions of the public body; (4) impose civil penalties; (5) assess costs
and attorney fees; (6) order the removal of a public officer who acted
with intent to deprive the public of information; and/or (7) “order
such equitable relief as it deems appropriate in the circumstances.”
A.R.S. § 38-431.07(A).
5.

Arizona

Availability of court costs and attorneys’ fees.

The court has discretion to “order payment to a successful plaintiff
in a suit brought under this section of the plaintiff’s reasonable attorney fees, by the defendant state, the political subdivision of the state
or the incorporated city or town of which the public body is a part or
to which it reports.” A.R.S. § 38-431.07(A). In determining whether
to assess attorney fees and costs, courts may consider the overall behavior of the public body and its attempt to comply with the spirit of
the OML. See Carefree Improvement Ass’n, 133 Ariz. at 114-15, 649
P.2d at 993-94.
Moreover, the Court may assess a public officer individually with
all costs and attorneys fees awarded to plaintiff if it “determines that a
public officer with intent to deprive the public of information violated
any provision of [the OML].” A.R.S. § 38-431.07(A).
10. Fines.
A civil penalty not to exceed five hundred dollars may be imposed
against a person who violates or knowingly aids in the violation of the
OML. A.R.S. § 38-431.07(A). Any penalty assessed shall be deposited
in the public body’s general fund. Id.
The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press

1.

Appeal routes.

Special action to appellate court: Special action, however, is not
available when “there is an equally plain, speedy, and adequate remedy
by appeal.” Ariz. R.P.S.A. 1(a); see Ariz. R.P.S.A. 8. Such an appeal
should be heard as soon as is necessary to preserve the legal rights of
appellant.
Regular appeal: A regular appeal is not an expedited action but
may be accelerated by order of the appellate court.
2.

Time limits for filing appeals.

Normal timing for appeals is set forth in the Arizona Rules of Civil
Appellate Procedure. Currently, “[a] notice of appeal required by
Rule 8 shall be filed with the clerk of the superior court not later than
30 days after the entry of the judgment from which the appeal is taken,
unless a different time is provided by law.” Ariz. R. Civ. App. P. 9.
3.

Contact of interested amici.

If not already involved in the action, the First Amendment Coalition of Arizona Inc. may be interested in participating as an amicus.
The Coalition may be contacted through the authors of this outline.
In addition, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press often files amicus briefs in cases involving significant media law issues
before a state’s highest court.
V.

ASSERTING A RIGHT TO COMMENT.
A.

Is there a right to participate in public meetings?

Arizona’s OML allows a member of the public to address a public
body on any issue within that body’s jurisdiction if an open call to
the public has been made during a public meeting. See A.R.S. § 38431.01(H).
B.

Must a commenter give notice of intentions to
comment?

The OML does not contain any express provisions requiring a commenter to notify the public body of his intent to speak at a public
meeting. Members of the public body are prohibited from discussing
or taking legal action on matters brought up during an open call unless those matters were properly noticed on the meeting agenda. See
id. At the conclusion of the open call, however, “individual members
of the public body may respond to criticism made by those who have
addressed the public body, may ask staff to review a matter or may ask
that a matter be put on a future agenda.” Id.
C. Can a public body limit comment?
Yes. A public body may limit public comment during an open call
by imposing reasonable time, place and manner restrictions. See id.
“Although it is legally appropriate to stop a speaker who is reasonably
perceived as threatening, disorderly, or impeding the fair progress of
discussion, public bodies must be cautious not to halt a speaker because of the speaker’s viewpoint.” Ariz. Att’y Gen. Op. No. I99-006.
D. How can a participant assert rights to comment?
Please see section A above.
E.

Are there sanctions for unapproved comment?

Arizona’s OML does contain any sanctions for unapproved comment.

1. Any person may request to examine or be furnished copies, printouts
or photographs of any public record during regular office hours or may
request that the custodian mail a copy of any public record not otherwise
available on the public body’s web site to the requesting person. The custodian may require any person requesting that the custodian mail a copy of
any public record to pay in advance for any copying and postage charges.
The custodian of such records shall promptly furnish such copies, printouts
or photographs and may charge a fee if the facilities are available, except
that public records for purposes listed in section 39-122 or 39-127 shall be
furnished without charge.
2. If requested, the custodian of the records of an agency shall also furnish
an index of records or categories of records that have been withheld and the
reasons the records or categories of records have been withheld from the
requesting person. The custodian shall not include in the index information
that is expressly made privileged or confidential in statute or a court order.
This paragraph shall not be construed by an administrative tribunal or a
court of competent jurisdiction to prevent or require an order compelling
a public body other than an agency to furnish an index. For the purposes
of this paragraph, “agency” has the same meaning prescribed in section 411001, but does not include the department of public safety, the department
of transportation motor vehicle division, the department of juvenile corrections and the state department of corrections.
3. If the custodian of a public record does not have facilities for making copies, printouts or photographs of a public record which a person has a right
to inspect, such person shall be granted access to the public record for the
purpose of making copies, printouts or photographs. The copies, printouts

may furnish reproductions, the charge for which shall include the following:
1. A portion of the cost to the public body for obtaining the original or copies of the documents, printouts or photographs.
2. A reasonable fee for the cost of time, materials, equipment and personnel
in producing such reproduction.

The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press

Open Government Guide
3. The value of the reproduction on the commercial market as best determined by the public body.
B. If the custodian of a public record determines that the commercial purpose stated in the statement is a misuse of public records or is an abuse of the
right to receive public records, the custodian may apply to the governor requesting that the governor by executive order prohibit the furnishing of copies,
printouts or photographs for such commercial purpose. The governor, upon
application from a custodian of public records, shall determine whether the
commercial purpose is a misuse or an abuse of the public record. If the governor determines that the public record shall not be provided for such commercial purpose the governor shall issue an executive order prohibiting the
providing of such public records for such commercial purpose. If no order is
issued within thirty days of the date of application, the custodian of public records shall provide such copies, printouts or photographs upon being paid the
fee determined pursuant to subsection A.
C. A person who obtains a public record for a commercial purpose without
indicating the commercial purpose or who obtains a public record for a noncommercial purpose and uses or knowingly allows the use of such public record
for a commercial purpose or who obtains a public record for a commercial
purpose and uses or knowingly allows the use of such public record for a different commercial purpose or who obtains a public record from anyone other
than the custodian of such records and uses it for a commercial purpose shall
in addition to other penalties be liable to the state or the political subdivision
from which the public record was obtained for damages in the amount of three
times the amount which would have been charged for the public record had
the commercial purpose been stated plus costs and reasonable attorney fees or
shall be liable to the state or the political subdivision for the amount of three
times the actual damages if it can be shown that the public record would not
have been provided had the commercial purpose of actual use been stated at the
time of obtaining the records.
D. For the purposes of this section, “commercial purpose” means the use of
a public record for the purpose of sale or resale or for the purpose of producing

writing and under oath of all the facts and circumstances requested by the

1. Be served on the person in the manner required for service of process in
this state or by certified mail, return receipt requested.
2. Describe the class or classes of documents or objects with sufficient definiteness to permit them to be fairly identified.
3. Prescribe a reasonable time at which the person shall appear to testify
and within which the document or object shall be produced and advise the
person that objections to or reasons for not complying with the demand
may be filed with the attorney general or county attorney on or before that
time.

to enforce the demand. Venue for the action to enforce the demand shall be in
Maricopa county or in the county in which the alleged violation occurred. Notice of hearing the action to enforce the demand and a copy of the action shall
be served on the person in the same manner as that prescribed in the Arizona

that the compliance will not violate a privilege and that there is not a conflict
of interest on the part of the attorney general or county attorney, that there is

violation, the court shall order the person to comply with the demand, subject

court’s order, the court may issue any of the following orders until the person
complies with the order:
1. Adjudging the person in contempt of court.

3. Granting other relief the court deems proper.
§ 38-431.07. Violations; enforcement; removal from office; in camera review
A. Any person affected by an alleged violation of this article, the attorney
general or the county attorney for the county in which an alleged violation of
this article occurred may commence a suit in the superior court in the county
in which the public body ordinarily meets, for the purpose of requiring compliance with, or the prevention of violations of, this article, by members of the
public body, or to determine the applicability of this article to matters or legal
actions of the public body. For each violation the court may impose a civil
penalty not to exceed five hundred dollars against a person who violates this
article or who knowingly aids, agrees to aid or attempts to aid another person in
violating this article and order such equitable relief as it deems appropriate in
the circumstances. The civil penalties awarded pursuant to this section shall be
deposited into the general fund of the public body concerned. The court may
also order payment to a successful plaintiff in a suit brought under this section
of the plaintiff’s reasonable attorney fees, by the defendant state, the political
subdivision of the state or the incorporated city or town of which the public
body is a part or to which it reports. If the court determines that a public officer
with intent to deprive the public of information violated any provision of this
article the court may remove the public officer from office and shall assess the
public officer or a person who knowingly aided, agreed to aid or attempted to
aid the public officer in violating this article, or both, with all of the costs and
attorney fees awarded to the plaintiff pursuant to this section.
