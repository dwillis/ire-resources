“How to Organize Your Reporting (and your life)”
IRE Conference 2019
Planning Your Day
•

Schedule shoots/interviews ahead of time

•

Schedule specific days for logging and writing

•

Use a cloud-based calendar to keep track of shoots for the team
•

Our photogs shoot all special projects, this includes franchises, so scheduling is
key

•

We send requests to our chief photog, who then adds them to a Google calendar,
that way we can all keep track of what’s happening (or determine if we need to go
through the assignment desk for a photog)

(I also keep a desktop calendar to write down all stories that have aired, interviews set up
with times and locations, days off, and important air dates for day turns, sweeps and
ongoing investigations)
•

Set aside a specific time during the day (early, late or during lunch) to return phone calls,
send emails and FOIAs

•

Make a short to-do list (Keep it on your phone, or use app. I still like sticky notes on my
desktop and visual lists!)

•

Set mental deadlines before your real ones! (This includes shoot times and tasks)

Planning Your Investigation
•

Map out your investigation/Storyboard

•

File PRRs/FOIAs

•

Make a list of everything you need to get/do…this includes video!

•

Have a conversation with your photographer ahead of time (EP, producers, gfx,
web/social etc.)

•

Schedule interviews

•

Set aside EXTRA time for any unplanned interviews and extra shoots

•

Communicate with EPs/ANDs, have reality check/update on progress (this will help with
deadlines)

•

Consider logging/transcription services to save time
•

Otter (600 free minutes per month, has app)-https://otter.ai/

•

Sonix (30-minute free trial, then paid subscription, no app)-https://sonix.ai/

•

Temi (One free upload, then pay per minute, has app)-https://www.temi.com/

•

Trint (30 minute free trial, then pay-go/subscribe, has app)-https://trint.com/

•

Block out specific time for writing/-re-writing (Be honest with yourself about time!)

•

Be specific when ordering graphics (meet or send email ahead of time to discuss vision)

•

Make specific notes on your script/send a final “here’s what you need” email to photog

•

Give your photog as much time as possible

•

Use time on the back end for web, social, etc.

Keeping track of records/FOIAs/rolling investigations
•

•

Copy/scan all paper documents (Your photog will thank you later!)
•

Get a scanner app on your phone

•

Invest in portable scanner

Create electronic folder (or cloud-based) for all important documents, pictures, extra stuff
•

Update it when you get new stuff!

•

This helps photog (Photog drags this folder over right before editing, or has
access if cloud based)

•

This makes it easy to share with others if you need to hand off a project

•

Use color coded manila folders for specific projects and records (These often correspond
with electronic folders)

•

Maintain a separate file for basic, ongoing projects

•

Create email folders for correspondence on investigations (this will help you keep track
and share)

•

Date calls and notes

•

Create spreadsheet with FOIA/PRR list (need to file, complete, etc.)
•

Color code as documents return

•

Set alerts on your phone to keep track of FOIA deadlines (I also make a note on my desk
calendar!)

•

Use Excel, Google Sheets etc. for story ideas

•

Use Google sheets for project sharing

•

Use a word document or excel spreadsheet to keep track of hotline phone calls
•

Include the callers’ names, numbers and details so you can go back to it or share
with others

•

When pieces air, file away the stuff you don’t need in front of you (I do a clean-up when
sweeps is over and place paper folders and documents in a filing cabinet, then start a new
rotation on my desk)

•

Use other tools to assist in big projects (dry erase boards, large calendars, binders, other
visual tools)

•

Consider organizational apps (Evernote, OneNote), other electronic tools (See Brian's
presentation!)

•

Keep thumb and external hard drives for files, records, documents or keep cloud-based
docs

•

DO WHAT WORKS FOR YOU!!
