Don’t be scared

Handling Uncertainty
• Most important question: is it safe? Are the
air/water pollution levels at a low enough
concentration to protect human health?
• Instead of cause and effect, focus on:
– What we know
– What we don’t know
– What’s being done vs what can be done
– Regulations and enforcement
– Compare the situation in different states

Example: Aliso Canyon

Air Pollution
• Six criteria pollutants: CO, lead, ozone, NO2,
particulate matter, SO2
• Everything else: no enforceable standards,
only guidelines that vary state by state. EPA
also has guidelines.
– Example: 1, 3-butadiene, a carcinogen used in
manufacturing synthetic rubber. Texas’ air quality
guideline is 60 times less protective than EPA’s,
and 340x less protective than California’s

Case studies: benzene after oil spills
• Kalamazoo River dilbit (tar sands oil) spill,
2010: 50 to 200 ppb. Voluntary evacuation.
Lifted after readings fell below 6 ppb.
• Mayflower, Ark. dilbit spill, 2013: evacuation
lifted after levels fell below 50 ppb.

Benzene air quality guideline examples
EPA: 9 ppb/day over a lifetime (for cancer risks)
ATSDR (part of CDC): 9 ppb for up to 2 weeks
(cancer not considered, not to be used as a
cleanup threshold)

Alberta, Canada: 9 ppb/hour. Only used in air
modeling for permit applications, not for public
emergencies

Resources
• OSHA
• EPA’s IRIS database
• ATSDR
• CalEPA
• Alberta’s ambient air quality guidelines
• New Jersey state guidelines

Finding experts
• Most doctors have little training in environmental
health
• Occupational health experts
• Air and water monitoring/sampling experts
• State/federal public health officials
• EPA’s ORD (Office of Research and Development)
• CDC
• NIH (NIEHS—National Institute of Environmental
Health Sciences)
• Scientists with federal grants

Water Pollution
• Many more enforceable federal standards
• But not everything is covered
– Toledo toxic algae pollution
– Elk River 2014: coal chemical spill
