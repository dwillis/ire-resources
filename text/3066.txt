Can we survive without fuel?
• Florida gas prices reached a record high of
$3.23 early this week
• The average vehicle consumes 550 gallons
of gasoline annually, according to the U.S.
Department of Transportation
• The average American household has at
least two vehicles

• Do your homework
• States agencies regulate gas
stations (usually the
department of agriculture)
• Accuracy inspections,
gasoline testing
• Spend a day following an
inspector
• Follow new regulation

Measuring accuracy
• A third of gas stations in
South Florida had at least one
device that failed inspection
• Consumers had filed 13,909
in the years of 2004-06 –33
percent of those came from
South Florida
• State inspectors don’t issue
fines to repeat offenders
• Punishment for cheating?
Device is taken out of service
until fixed

Interview the data

Rank the data
• 173 gas stations in
South Florida failed
more than 10 tests
from 2004-06
• Be creative and think
about online
• Use google maps to
show repeat
offenders

Data for the daily story
• Gas stations scrambling
to meet law requirements
before the deadline
• State collects information
about gas stations and
status
• Post the data online to
inform readers

Provide data online

Follow the story

What we found
• A third of gas stations required to install
wiring for backup generators have not done
so, two months after the law went into
effect
• Many small and independent operators can’t
afford to install the system
• In South Florida, 30 of 105 stations affected
by the law have yet to comply
