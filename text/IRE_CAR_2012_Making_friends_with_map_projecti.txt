Making friends with map projections

Why bother with map projections?

Flat maps are useful, but only if they're both legible and accurate

The fundamental problem

The earth is a spheroid (not a sphere, BTW), and most maps are flat.

No solution

It's impossible to represent a 3D object in 2D with total accuracy.

More data, more problems

The Internet is flooded with maps in many different projections.

To hack responsibly, you need to know a little

When mixing two data sets, you need to keep projections in line.
Patricia Murietta's example shows how apples become oranges.

You've may have already heard of:
● Mercator
● UTM
● State plane coordinates

Mercator
Old (1569), invented to show navigation in a single direction as
a straight line
Good qualities
● Very familiar to people
● Lowest distortion near
equator

Less-admirable qualities
● Huge distortion at
high latitudes
● Not good for measuring
distances

UTM (Universal Trans-Mercator)
Developed by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1940s to make
measuring distances easy
Good qualities
● Measures small distances
very accurately in meters
● Good at representing
small to medium-sized areas
Less-admirable qualities
● Visually distorts farther
away from center of zone

State plane coordinates
Via Wikipedia: 110 zones in the continental U.S., with 10 more
in Alaska, 5 in Hawaii, often used by state and local
governments
Good qualities
● Ignores the curvature of the earth, which simplifies
calculations
● Highly accurate over small distances
Less-admirable qualities
● Rapidly decreasing accuracy farther out
● Follows county lines, but not as regular, so you have to
know your state

Projections you haven't heard of but need
USA Contiguous Albers Equal Area
(Good for continental USA maps)

Alaska Albers (Good for an Alaska map)

Spherical Mercator (The google maps projection)

NAD (North American Datum)
Several variations, used by census and USGS
WGS - If all else fails, try SRID 4326 on mystery
data

How do I tell which projection I have?
Any time you get new spatial data, you'll need to know what
projection the data uses
How to tell:
● Ask the person you got it from
● Find out what that agency generally uses
● Hopefully, the projection will be specified inside the data
● Projections are best referenced by SRID number if available
○ SRID = Spatial Reference System Identifier
○ Like taxonomy for projections

The proj4 from qgis:

],
PRIMEM["Greenwich",0.0],

Which projections to use for your maps
How big an area? Who is your audience?
City map
● State plane, Your friendly local UTM zone (link)

State map
● Mercator (with exceptions), UTM, State plane

U.S. map
● U.S. Albers, UTM Zone 14N?, Mercator
● Don't forget insets for Hawaii, Alaska

World map
● XXXX, Mercator (not generally first choice)

3D mapping
● Easy answer: 4326 (WGS 84) overlays nicely

Tools for projecting spatial data

Managing projections at your org
● Make a cheat sheet for the agencies you care about
● Pick a master projection for each situation
● Keep a master version of every SHP set you regularly use
● Get agreement among graphics, GIS and web pundits on
what everyone expects to be delivered and how maps will
be displayed (may be different)
