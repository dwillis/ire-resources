Investigating nursing homes

What is a nursing home?
• If you plan to call it a nursing home, make sure it is one.
• A nursing home can either be all private paying, insured residents or one that
collects Medicare and/or Medicaid for its services. The inspection requirements
may be different in your state.
• Things that are not nursing homes: residential care homes, intermediate care
facilities for the mentally retarded (ICFMRS), assisted living facilities, continuum
of care facilities (combines assisted living and nursing home), adult day care. All
are likely inspected but may be regulated differently. Some are lightly regulated,
which allows a higher potential for abuse.
Get to know the regulators
• What agency is responsible for inspecting nursing homes in your state? The
federal govt. contracts with states to inspect all nursing homes and other facilities
that take Medicaid and Medicare.
• There may be other agencies inspecting as well. In Oklahoma, ombudsmen hired
by the Department of Human Services investigate complaints of abuse or neglect
involving residents of such facilities. Get to know them.
• Are there other regulators that also have oversight duty? What about the board of
nursing, the board that licenses the administrator or the medical licensure board?
All may have documents you need.
• Find out what reports these regulators routinely produce, ask about the problem
homes.
Documents to pull
• Whether you have a specific home in mind or want to check several, ask for the
inspection files.
• Routine inspections are required at least once every 15 months. Complaint
inspections are either done alone or combined with routine inspections, depending
on severity.
• Be sure to look at other things in the file: ownership documents, letters from the
state threatening sanctions etc. These may be kept in another file so ask if you
have everything on the home. Find out who the owners are and what else they
own.
• Examine more than the last inspection. I usually look at three years’ worth of
complaint and routine inspections for a full picture.
• Also look for lawsuits against the home, especially any that have been settled or
resulted in verdicts against the home.

Cost reports: Facilities that take Medicare or Medicaid are required to report how
they spend their money, salaries etc. These are valuable documents to assess when
nursing homes claim they just can’t afford to provide good care.
Other sources of data: death certificates, ME reports, police reports.

What to look for in inspection reports
• How many deficiencies are there? The U.S. average is 8 and every state has its
own average. If there are twice the average deficiencies on several consecutive
reports, this is a red flag.
• How serious are the deficiencies? These are rated on a letter-based grid, based on
the level of harm and how many residents are affected.
• Look for “IJs” or immediate jeopardy citations. Those require the home to fix the
problem immediately and a “fine” clock starts running when they are cited.
• Look for quality of care, mistreatment, denial of rights and serious medical errors.
• Don’t assume all NHs are bad. Paperwork errors resulting in no harm, minor
housekeeping issues should not be a reason to hammer a home that otherwise is
doing its job.
• You can get basic results online but the real details are contained in the paper
reports. www.medicare.gov will get the last three reports and other data on homes
that accept medicare and medicaid. Select ``compare nursing homes in your
area.’’
Story ideas
• Backlog of complaints: Ask how many pending complaints your state’s nursing
home inspection division has. Is that list growing? How serious are they and how
long have they been pending?
• Failure to collect fines: States and the federal govt. collect only a fraction in most
cases. If you do a story in which the state brags about a big fine, follow up to see
whether it was ever collected.
• Ask for a report from your state and/or CMS on all pending fines, how long they
have been pending, what was fined vs. what was eventually collected.
• Deaths in nursing homes: Get a database of death certificates, ME reports and
search for deaths caused by bed sores, malnutrition, dehydration, accidents etc.
Keep in mind that malnutrition could be caused by someone with an end of life
directive. We found at least 1,000 preventable deaths over the 10 years we
examined.
• Sex offenders in nursing homes: Match the list of homes with the list of offenders.
Many homes are not telling residents, citing HIPPA.

Is your state placing people in bad nursing homes?
• Most states have authority to take vulnerable adults into protective custody and
place them in nursing homes if necessary. Ask for a list of homes where your state
Dept. of Human Services has placed such adults. Pull the reports.
• When we did this, we found people placed in homes the state was citing for abuse
and neglect.
Industry-packed oversight boards?
• In our state, the governor had appointed a nursing home operator to an oversight
board whose home was cited with 50 deficiencies and eventually closed.
• Look at your state nursing home administrator licensing board. The state
inspection agency forwards systemic problems to this board for possible action
against the nursing home administrator. Most states follow such a system.
• We built a database of three years’ worth of cases forwarded to this licensing
board by our state. Our state NH administrator licensing board dismissed 83
percent of its cases and a committee made up entirely of NH owners decided what
to do about cases. Our state passed a law replacing the entire board and
restructuring it to reduce the number of NH owners.
Resources
• www.medicare.gov. Click on compare nursing homes in your state, find home by
name or location, choose “view all information about this nursing home” and then
select inspection reports.
• Ask for electronic data. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has
some data available. Some of it is large and difficult for beginners to analyze.
Check the CMS Web site for more information:
• http://www.cms.hhs.gov/home/rsds.asp
• Watchdog groups such as A Perfect Cause, www.aperfectcause.org, may have
data on their sites. Check the accuracy with your state.
