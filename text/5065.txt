Knows About Elections

● Let’s do this.

1. You need to be able to
call your own races.

2. "Percent reporting" is
not the same as precincts
reporting / total precincts

def calculate_pct_reporting(pcts_reporting,total_pcts,total_votes)
pct_reporting = sprintf( "%1.0f", pcts_reporting.to_f / total_pcts * 100) + "%"
if pct_reporting == "0%" && total_votes > 0
pct_reporting = "Initial results"
elsif pct_reporting == "100%" && ( precincts_reporting != total_pcts )
pct_reporting = "99%"
end
return pct_reporting
end

midnight on the next day.

11. Last updated should be
our last request not the
last change.

12. A candidate can run in

different parties.

13. Candidates can run

always move data for
uncontested races.

17. Candidates can be
removed from the
ballot at any time.

18. Not all general
elections are held on
general election day.

19. We call races with a
button on a website.

20. Two candidates from
the same party can
compete for an office in
the general election.

21. This will ruin your
precious calculations for
control of Congress.

22. Don’t hard-code GOP
and Democrat anywhere.

23. Roll up unimportant
candidate results with
"others" label.

24. House races have
inconsistent IDs. Make
standardized ones.

25. We will want an
unknown number of
non-national races and
ballot initiatives.

26. AP ballot initiative
titles are junk.

27. Democrats aren’t
Democrats in
every state.

the incumbent.

in descending order of vote
totals and mark winners.

District of Columbia.

31. County results are
absolute madness.

32. Don’t forget the
District of Columbia.

change between elections.

45. Control of Congress is
the devil’s handiwork.

46. You can have two races
for the same House seat on
election day.

47. Races might need to be
un-called and re-called.

48. AP can call the wrong
winner, though it’s rare.

match the sum of county
vote totals.

50. When polls close,
switch the display from
"polls close at xx:xx"
to "0 votes."

District of Columbia.

52. Sometimes we call
races early. Sometimes we
call them late.

53. Colors are impossible.

54. Maine and Nebraska
have no respect for the
electoral college.

55. Gains and losses
vs. redistricting.
