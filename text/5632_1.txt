Record retention schedule

Most states and local government have a
document detailing how long they must hold
on to documents. That document, in turn,
provides a good window into all the different
types of documents each agency produces.

Master list of forms

Want to know what data/info an agency
keeps? Ask to see the list of forms. If you see
any interesting form on the list, ask for a copy
of the form itself. (Note: If an agency says it
doesn't have a list of forms, you can just FOIA
all the forms instead.)

Record layout / Data dictionary

What information is in the agency's database?
What do the codes mean? Those all should
be explained in the documentation, typically
called a record layout or data dictionary.

Manuals/policies/guidelines

It's important to know how an agency collects
information and what rules it follows. To figure
that out, it's worth requesting the agency's
manuals, policies, and guidelines.Sometimes
you'll find out about reports or documents
mentioned in the rules that you didn't know
about. Other times, you'll find out the agency
isn't following its own rules.

traffic/parking tickets

Most states and local governments will
release some details on all the tickets they
issued, but may withhold the name and the
identity of the person who received the ticket.
Nevertheless, you can still find lots of stories what officers give out the most tickets, the
hotspots and times for ticketing, what kinds of
tickets are given out, how fast you have to be
going to get a speeding ticket...etc.

Most states will provide detailed lists, showing

$600. Take a closer look at the repeat
winners. One person in Massachusetts has

worth noting how often the winner is listed
under a trust - raising questions about who
really received the money - or whether lottery
store owners are among the winners.

Emails

Emails related to government business are
usually public. But you often have to be
selective about what email you can request
because the volume of documents can be so
large. So you might ask for email from certain
people on certain dates or ask the
government agency to search for email with
certain keywords.
