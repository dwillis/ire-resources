● Most common measure:
Dissimilarity index
● Neighborhood shares of 2
groups: white and black, or
white and Hispanic, etc.

have to move so all
neighborhoods =
city/metro?
● Also uses for schools,
occupations, etc.

Diversity Index
● Summarizes racial mix
to 0-100 scale
● Chance that 2 random
people are different
● Compare places, times

Income inequality
● ACS tracks this using the
Gini Index (B19083)
● Rating is between 0 and 1.
● 0 is most equal, 1 is ultimate
inequality, so the higher your
number, the more inequality.
● The Deep South has some of
the largest swaths of
income-inequal areas

Health insurance
● Who has it, who doesn’t, and
who has what type

are/Medicaid/VA/etc.-provided

educational attainment

Unemployment by race
● The Census doesn’t track
unemployment monthly
like the BLS does, but it
does offer a breakdown by
racial subgroups.
● Look for table C23002 and
its variants

Veterans
● You can look at total veterans, or
by race/age/gender subgroup
(table B21001 and variants)
● You can also look at vets by the
period/conflict in which they
served (B21002)
