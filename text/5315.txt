KENTUCKY’S OPEN RECORDS ACT
KRS 61.870 to 61.884

OPEN RECORDS ACT POLICY
The General Assembly finds and declares that the basic policy of KRS 61.870 to 61.884 is that
free and open examination of public records is in the public interest and the exceptions …
shall be strictly construed, even though such examination may cause inconvenience or
embarrassment to public officials or others.

[KRS 61.871]

DEFINITION OF “PUBLIC RECORD”
All books, papers, maps, photographs, cards, tapes, discs, diskettes, recordings, software, or other
documentation regardless of physical form or characteristics, which are prepared, owned, used, in
the possession of or retained by a public agency.
[KRS 61.870(2)]

RIGHT TO INSPECTION
All public records shall be open for inspection by any
person, except as otherwise provided by KRS 61.870 to
61.884, and suitable facilities shall be made available by
each public agency for the exercise of this right.

[Krs 61.872(1)]

REQUEST FOR RECORDS
The official custodian may require written application, signed by the applicant and with his name
printed legibly on the application, describing the records to be inspected. The application shall be
hand delivered, mailed, or sent via facsimile to the public agency.

PUBLIC AGENCY’S RESPONSE /
DENIAL

Each public agency, upon any request for records … shall notify in writing the

withholding of the record and a brief explanation of how the
exception applies to the record withheld.

APPEAL

ANOTHER RECENT (PARTIAL)
RESPONSE

INDIANA’S ACCESS TO PUBLIC
RECORDS ACT
“APRA” - I.C. 5-14-3-1 through I.C. 5-14-3-10

(Office of the Public Access Counselor and Formal Complaint Act, I.C. 5-14-4-1 through

I.C. 5-14-5-12.)

APRA’S POLICY
A fundamental philosophy of the American constitutional form of representative government is
that government is the servant of the people and not their master. Accordingly, it is the public
policy of the state that all persons are entitled to full and complete information regarding the
affairs of government and the official acts of those who represent them as public officials and
employees. Providing persons with the information is an essential function of a representative
government and an integral part of the routine duties of public officials and employees, whose
duty it is to provide the information.

[I.C. 5-14-3-1]

DEFINITION OF “PUBLIC RECORD”
"Public record" means any writing, paper, report, study, map, photograph, book, card, tape
recording, or other material that is created, received, retained, maintained, or filed by or with a
public agency and which is generated on paper, paper substitutes, photographic media, chemically
based media, magnetic or machine readable media, electronically stored data, or any other
material, regardless of form or characteristics.
[I.C. 5-14-3-2(o)]

RIGHT TO INSPECTION / REQUEST
FOR RECORDS
Any person may inspect and copy the public records…

A request for inspection or copying must:
(1) identify with reasonable particularity the record being requested; and
(2) be, at the discretion of the agency, in writing on or in a form provided by the agency. …
[I.C. § 5-14-3-3]

AGENCY’S RESPONSE
Within a reasonable time after the request is received by the agency, the public agency shall
either:
(1) provide the requested copies to the person making the request; or
(2) allow the person to make copies: (A) on the agency's equipment; or (B) on the
person's own equipment.
[I.C. 5-14-3-3(b)]

AGENCY’S DENIAL OF ACCESS
“If a person requests by mail or by facsimile a copy or copies of a public record, a denial of
disclosure does not occur until seven days have elapsed from the date the public agency
receives the request.”

The agency’s written denial should include “a statement of the specific exemption or exemptions
authorizing the withholding of all or part of the public record.”
[I.C. 5-14-3-9(c) & (d)]

PUBLIC ACCESS COUNSELOR /
APPEALS
• Appointed by the governor for a four-year term. [I.C. 5-14-4-6]
• Gives informal advice and advisory opinions on formal complaints, which must be filed within
30 days of a denial of records. [I.C. 5-14-5-7]
• Issues advisory opinions on complaints within 30 days of filing. [I.C. 5-14-5-9]

PUBLIC ACCESS COUNSELOR
OPINIONS
• Opinions by the Public Access Counselor are informal and do not have the force or effect of
law. Thus, they need not be “appealed.”
• However, a favorable Public Access Counselor opinion is generally necessary before a court will
consider awarding costs or fees to a prevailing requester. [IC 5-14-3-9(i)]

HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO FOIA!
• FOIA = Federal Freedom of Information Act

•

THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT, 5 U.S.C. SECT. 552, AS AMENDED BY PUBLIC LAW NO. 104-231, 110 STAT. 3048
– Term interchanged with open records laws, but FOIA specific to federal gov’t

• FOIA initially proposed in 1955 by Democratic Congressman John Moss from California in 1955
• Supported by Donald Rumsfeld of all people

• Signed on July 4, 1966 by LBJ – 50 years old!
– Went into effect on July 4, 1967

• Amended first 1974 post Watergate and included several more amendments to both tighten and loosen availability including electronic
issues and national security issues
– Rumsfeld and Scalia didn’t like first batch of amendments – which called for a 10 day response time, and sanctions and waiving fees for
journos and interest groups

WHAT DOES IT COVER?
• Most documents created by federal agencies in the executive branch

• Includes databases, emails, investigation notes from closed cases, etc.
• All federal agencies in executive branch subject to FOIA including the military, FBI, DEA,
Department of Justice, etc.
– With some exceptions, of course

WHAT DOESN’T IT COVER?
• Explicitly only applies to executive branch. Congress not covered
– You can’t get your congressman’s email, for example

• Also doesn’t apply to president or those advising him/her directly
• Judicial branch exempt; no peeking into emails of Supreme Court

• Separate from state open records or sunshine rules
– Ohio grade: http://watchdog.org/249149/grateful-public-records/
– Concept is the same however

WHAT ELSE IS EXEMPTED?
• National defense/foreign policy

• Personnel issues
• Trade secrets/financial information
• Personal information and medical information

• Law enforcement for ongoing investigations
• Internal bank records
• Geographic data, maps/wells
• Anything older than 25 years is open to FOIA

HOW TO USE IT
• Know who has data and work directly with them
– Cut out the middleman or pr/PIO office

• Be specific (easily ruled out for being overbroad)
– Example: emails – don’t ask for all emails for a year from someone. Ask for a certain subject and
time frame

• Make sure you submit the request to the bona fide custodian of the record, not a department
head or another admin figure
• Read the rules or ask first
– All agencies are supposed to have a document retention policy

HOW TO USE IT PART II
• Avoid using it!!
– 1-2 year wait times now routine

• Use state laws to access reports filed with federal government
– Speeds up process

• Ask for original format – NO PDFs!
• Use different variations of a name: "Carrie Cox" and/or "Carrie D. Cox”
• Use examples from your own work – both successful and not

TIPS AND TRICKS
• Persistence pays off
– But be polite – let your lawyer be the bad cop

• Value in denial of records
– Confirm records exist/ask for specific reason for exception

• Request records you already have
– Confirm they are real and get the full document

• Request same records from different public agencies
– Feds and state/state and local

• Do business in person
– Pick up the phone at least
– Make lot more happen being personal with people
– Sometimes don’t even need to file request if you just ask for it

• Track everything!
– Makes it easier for appeals etc.

MORE TIPS AND TRICKS
• Request records you might need in six months to a year.

• Always ask for a fee waiver and expedited processing
• Don’t be afraid to pick up the phone and call the FOIA officer.
– Some sympathetic to journalistic requests (they get a lot of commercial requests) and can help you
to refine your request to get the records you most need quickly
