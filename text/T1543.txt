Q: Does the notepad reporter -- who never reports on “statistics”-- need to know stastistics ?
o Statistical thinking probably won’t win promotions or prizes. It will help reporters get more
stories correct.
o The logic of statistical inference can help “writerly” reporters—as it’s helped researchers in
other fields for 50
years. A few statistical concepts can be more helpful to qualitative reporters, than to quantitative
reporters who
work with statistics software and copious data. [ Slide 2 ]
o Favor reporting methods that minimize bias and variance
§ You want to get as close to the truth as professionally and humanly possible.
§ Bias – How far are your estimates off target, on average ? [ Slide 3 & 4 ]
§ Variance – How often will you be close to the target ? [ Slide 5 ]
o Be a Model Thinker -- Don’t just grab the phone ; Choosing what to research requires the insight
of a theory.
§ Model your theory explicitly, to protect against the bias of your implicit ideas and stereotypes:
Y ~ X1 + X2 + Random World
§
§

Math-type models are power tools for reasoning, offering a tighter grip than slippery words. [Slide 6]
Y is some outcome variable effected by X explanatory variables, e.g. Teen Parenthood from Low Self

Esteem ?
Cancer from Agent Orange ? Promotions thwarted by Racism ?

§
§

Y is the outcome you want to explain -- Cancer among Veterans; Teen parenthood.
Xs might explain Y’s outcome.

§

Q: Why teen parents ? Leon Dash, “Children’s Children,” The Washington Post, p. A1, Jan.

§ Separates systematic effects that will be there tomorrow, from today’s chance outcome – however
entertaining.
§ Still, acknowledge Random World factor– Because your systematic explanation is only correct on
average.

26, 1986
Teen Parenthood ~ Desired Welfare Payments + Boyfriend’s Machismo + Random World
???
or
Teen Parenthood ~ Self Esteem Level + Ambition Level + Random World ???
§ List implications of your theory that you can observe.

§
§

Risk falsification -- what would convince you that you’re wrong ?
Choose your variables from this list of observables.

o Which explanatory variables (Xs) ?
§ Omitted variable = The answer to your question, “What am I missing ?”
§ Biases your estimate of how your Xs effect your Y, if it systematically moves your Y
alongside your Xs.
[Slide 7]
§
§
§
§

Bring omitted variable into your model – and investigate -- if:
It moves with your Y and Xs and…
Partly determines the Xs of interest.
When you don’t omit such variables – and measure them along with the Y and Xs you really care about –

then
you’ve performed controlled research.
§ e.g.: Gender, Race, Education, Miles from Landfill
§ But even if they don’t move with your Xs (and so, don’t bias your estimate of Xs’ effects), omitted
variables can still
mess up your forecasts of Y’s outcome. This may only matter in reporting on stocks or sports.

§

Danger of lessons from a “success story” -- Your explanations can’t exceed your cases (or the

“n’s”, in
statistics jargon).
§
§
§
§

One case – e.g. one observation on a person’s Y and Xs – explains nothing. [ Slide 8 ]
You need at least two cases to study one X, three cases to study two Xs, etc… [ Slide 9 ]
Because you can’t determine a line with one point, nor a plane with just two points. [ Slide 10 ]
Be modest. The less your n’s outnumber your Xs, the less certain your inferences (it ups the variance).

Selection sampling
§ Reporting isn’t a random sampling – so it lacks the insurance against omitted variables that a
random sample
provides.
§ But where the population is small – e.g. just the local merchants – you don’t even want to
randomly sample.

§ What should keep reporters awake at night: Whether you are sampling in a way that makes Y look like
it’s tending
toward one direction, thereby biasing your estimate of Xs’ effect. [Slide 11]

§ Before you can worry if your sample is representative, you must ask what population you’re
studying,
i.e., what general group : All pregnancy-risk teens ? All Townsville merchants ? All potential
Enrons ?
§ Then think about what biases your selection of observations (“cases”).
§
§
§
§
§

Your list of names to call.
Your limited budget of money, effort and time.
Administrative decisions – e.g. classifying rapes as lesser crimes, to downplay the problem.
The choices of the people you’re studying.
A subtlety – Who chooses to be on welfare rolls ? …quoted in news stories ? …on an association list ?

…in
a phone directory ? …in a listing of media-friendly experts ?
§ e.g., a censored sample – Your Y really takes on a greater range than you’re able to see. Not just FOIA
censors, but
question categories like “$100,000 or more.” [Slide 12]
§ Ask (literally) how the world produces (i.e. “selects”) the data that are your observations, and how those
observations got to you.

§

So how should you select ?

§ The Golden Rule = Avoid selections that only push your outcome Y in a particular direction.
§ Your cases should vary over Y’s full possible range: Teens--parents or not; Stocks–both gods and dogs.
§ Oops ! e.g.: Leon Dash’s teenage parents; Smart Money’s successful stocks; Harvard Business Professor
Michael Porter’s successfully competitive businesses and countries. [ Slides 13, 14 & 15 ]
• If you want to learn what causes plane crashes, don’t just study flights that crashed.
• If you want to test causes of teenage pregnancy, don’t just interview teen parents.
• If you want to understand successful businesses or stocks, don’t just look at the successes.
§ Counterintuitive for journalists – who race to where the action is, not where it isn’t; who tell success
stories, or seek
out the victims.
§ Try to study your Xs over a wide range of values, without first thinking about their outcome.
§ Imagine running an experiment where you assign identical people or entities to either the “treatment” or
the
placebo control…or the same person to one, then the other.
§ Find the matching people or entities that the world has assigned to those “treatments” and “placebos”.
§ These are your “counterfactuals” – with different values of the X of interest, but the same values on the
“control” Xs that you presciently didn’t omit from your model: e.g. Different amounts of job training, with
controls for race, gender, hours worked.
§ If the only available cases do have the same outcome level on Y, try a “case control” selection approach –
look for
cases with extremely different levels on your Xs.
§ While this can allow you to study an effect, it still gives a biased description of what’s out there.

How many cases (how large an n), reduce bias and uncertainty?
§ Think not in terms of sources or cases, but “observations.”
§
§

Consider sublevels , within your city or industry.
Consider other measures of the same subjects.

§

How many ? You typically approach statistical nirvana, after several dozen observations.

§ But we don’t seek nirvana on a deadline. The realistic number depends on how widely your outcome Y
varies (out
in the real world); how closely your Xs move with one another (in the real world); and how wide a range of
Xs you
sampled (in your reporting) [Slide 16]
§ Think about these factors and try to sample over a wide range of your explanatory X.

o Bad measures – Another cause of bias and uncertainty.
§ See if you’re really measuring what you think you’re measuring ~ ask the same question
several different
ways.
§ If answers require interpretation – i.e. “coding” – use codings performed for some purpose
other than your
research.
§ Have someone else interpret the answer – someone who doesn’t know your hypothesis.
o If you revise your theory – test it on new data.
§ So keep some (representative) sources in reserve.
o These ideas will seem familiar to someone who’s taken a statistics course – but he probably only
thinks them
relevant when he’s “doing statistics” on a bunch of numbers.
§ But qualitative inquiries must also follow these rules, to reach valid conclusions.
