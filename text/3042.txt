Investigating Subprime Lending & Foreclosures

HMDA Data
Federal Home Mortgage Disclosure Act database
http://www.ire.org/datalibrary/databases/databases.php
Subprime = Spread
To find subprime loans, you will need to focus on the “Spread” field. The Spread is the
“difference between the annual percentage rate and the Treasury Yield if it is greater or
equal to 3 percentage points for a 1st lien, 5 points for a subordinate lien.”
In super basic terms for HMDA data, that translates to: For a first mortgage, if the
“Spread” number is equal to or greater than 3, than it is subprime. For a second or third
mortgage, the “Spread” is any number that is equal to or greater than 5. Prime loans
are then less than the number 3 or 5, depending on what kind of loan you’re interested
in.
The Update Function
To “count” how many subprime loans you have, you will need to create a new column
and do what is called an “Update Function.”
1. Create a new column in your main table and call it “Prime”
2. Open a new query
3. Choose “Update Query” under “Query” list on the main menu bar
4. Type in the following to find which loans are “subprime conventional first
mortgages for single-family homes”

You can also use the Update function to find out how many minorities received
subprime loans, this time using the “APP_ETH” and “APP_RACE” fields. First,
create a new column called “minority.” To put a “1” in any time the first applicant is
listed as a non-white race code, type in this SQL code:
UPDATE 04HMDA SET [04HMDA].MINORITY = '1'
WHERE ((([04HMDA].APP_RACE1)="1" Or ([04HMDA].APP_RACE1)="2" Or ([04HMDA].APP_RACE1)="3" Or
([04HMDA].APP_RACE1)="4") AND (([04HMDA].APP_ETH)="1"));

You can continue to use Update Functions to divvy up the Income field (using census
data as a guide) to find out if income makes a difference.
After you’ve “updated” everything, start doing counts to see if blacks, Latinos,
women, etc. were more likely to receive a subprime loan. You can also use the
“Tract” and “County” fields to find out if certain neighborhoods received a higher
number of subprime loans.

Find out if your state even regulates or licenses mortgage brokers or has a law
against “mortgage fraud.” Many states do not.
