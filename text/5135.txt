Know that the U.S. Department of Education has a specific FERPA exemption:
“Postsecondary institutions may disclose the final results of disciplinary
proceedings if the institution has found that the student has violated the
institution’s rules or policies in regards to a crime of violence or a nonforcible sex offense.”
Schools can also release “directory information” such as “student's name,
address, telephone number, date and place of birth, honors and awards, and
dates of attendance”
