•PDF is the worst possible format
for information exchange.

•“Portable Document Format” is electronic paper,
meant to be rendered the same way regardless
of the device.

•PDF cares about the form, we just
care about the content.

But PDFs are regularly used for
publishing important information.

Why?

Ignorance

Malice

“The crime stats are subject to being corruptible in an
excel sheet. They have been changed in the past by
persons unknown and this affects the veracity of the
original data posted. If stats are posted on-line in a
PDF format, this reduces the risk of contamination.
[...] Effective immediately the stats should just be
posted in a PDF format.”
-Minneapolis Police Department

Extracting tables from PDF files is a pervasive
problem in data journalism.

•This data is trapped in a PDF.
•To reproduce the information, we need to
break the PDF down and analyze it.

• Tabula is making an ambitious claim.
•Tabular information can be represented in many
different ways.
Very heuristic problem, lots of edge cases.
Story of our lives.

Types of PDFs
● “Text-based” files
○ Can select text inside the file.
○ PDF stores the exact page position of every single
character, so it looks the same everywhere.
● Scanned files
○ Just a collection of images.
○ PDF format doesn’t actually know anything about the
underlying information.
○ Tabula can’t do anything about this unless maybe if the file
is processed with OCR software first.

Two Algorithms
1. “Original”:
● Ignores lines
● Only uses text positions, specifically “rivers” of white space
where there are no characters
● Don’t select “spanning” headers!

2. “spreadsheet”:
● uses only lines, ignores characters
● uses computational geometry to construct cell locations from
the lines.
● can find spanning cells
