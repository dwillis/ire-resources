Major U.S. poultry firms are administering antibiotics to their flocks far
more pervasively than regulators realize, posing a potential risk to human
health.
Internal records examined by Reuters reveal that some of the nation’s
largest poultry producers routinely feed chickens an array of antibiotics –
not just when sickness strikes, but as a standard practice over most of the
birds’ lives.
…The documented evidence of routine use of antibiotics for long durations
was “astonishing,” said Donald Kennedy, a former U.S. Food and Drug
Administration commissioner.
…Reuters reviewed more than 320 documents generated by six major
poultry companies during the past two years. Called “feed tickets,” the
documents are issued to chicken growers by the mills that make feed to
poultry companies’ specifications.

factcheck to Apley:
Our article, for purposes of disclosure related to you and
many other experts we quote, also says you've done work
for the leading antibiotics companies. That comes from
various disclosures like http://www.nfid.org/professionaleducation/archives/acar/acar10.pdf (Elanco grants, Elanco
and Pfizer advisor, consultant or speaker)
http://extension.vetmed.ufl.edu/files/2011/10/ACVIMAbs.pdf (consultation and training services or has had
research funded by Fort Dodge, Bayer Animal Health,
Elanco, Pfizer Inc Animal Health Group, Pharmacia, Intervet,
Merial, Boerhinger-Ingelheim, Schering, Novartis, Vet Life,
and the National Pork Board).

• PAPICH (2006, 2004)
Had financial ties to Pfizer, Merck, Merial, and Bayer Animal Health. Agreed
to speak but not vote at the 2006 panel. Later shared a $160,000 fellowship
from Pfizer Animal Health (now Zoetis) and Morris Animal Foundation.
Papich: “If you don’t have any of these relationships, you have to wonder:
Are they really an expert on something?”
• RIDDELL (2006)
Owned $25,000-$50,000 of Pfizer stock when he evaluated a competing
firm’s antibiotic. Voted for the drug but FDA rejected it. Leads a veterinary
association that sponsors scholarships and awards with funding from Zoetis
(formerly part of Pfizer) and other drug makers.
Riddell: “I would like to think I make decisions in what I do based on science
and based on good information.”
• MEALEY (2004)
Says this was the first time she had to disclose financial ties. Now a member
of the veterinary school’s newly formed conflict-of-interest committee.
Mealey: “We are behind human medicine (in disclosure) and we’re trying to
catch up.”
• Sources: FDA disclosure and waiver forms, meeting transcripts, resumes,
journals, news releases and articles.

The FDA is counting on vets to curb antibiotic use, but not even the
government knows which of the animal doctors has financial ties to the
pharmaceutical industry.
…Veterinary medicine is a little-regulated corner of the medical profession,
more dependent on industry funding than its human counterparts, and Reuters
found that drug companies support veterinarians at every stage of their
careers.
Sometimes the payments are small – $10 for a meal or $250 for an hour’s
talk. But larger funding arrangements – $100,000 for research, for example –
are not uncommon.
Of the 22 veterinarians who advised the FDA in recent years on how to use
antibiotics on farms, 11 received money from pharmaceutical companies.
Many of these details weren’t disclosed by the FDA. (Reuters, 12/23/14)

Hi Duff,
Attached are our responses. We feel we have provided you with
ample information, time and resources related to your story and
that these responses will conclude our involvement. We look

…In the past four years, the association accepted $3.3 million from
pharmaceutical companies, said Ron DeHaven, its executive vice president.
The amount has not been previously reported.
…In 2009, the association appointed an Antimicrobial Use Task Force to
respond to rising concerns about antibiotics in animal agriculture.
Although its 15 members filled out disclosure forms, the association will
not make their responses public.
By reviewing other records, Reuters found six of the 15 task force
members had financial ties to drug makers.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AT ZOETIS

Purdue pays Reed $276,000 a year. In March, Zoetis named him to its
board of directors. That position pays Reed $240,000 annually in cash
and stock and requires directors to act in the fiduciary interest of the
company. The task force announcement last month didn’t mention
Reed’s tie to Zoetis.

Reed’s dual role creates “an ethical smog” because the veterinary
school and dean could be perceived as too close to the interests of a
single drug company, said Thomas Donaldson, professor of business
ethics at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. The
connection to Zoetis, he said, should have been disclosed prominently
when the colleges set up the antibiotics task force. “That’s a no
brainer,” Donaldson said. “You’ve got a tiger by the tail there.”
Reed declined to talk to Reuters directly, but issued a statement –
through Zoetis.
