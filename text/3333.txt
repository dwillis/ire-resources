Reporting strategies
• DO
–
–
–
–
–

Focus your reporting on a specific story or idea.
Ground‐truth the data
Look at Inspector General reports and congressional oversight regularly for story tips
Get to know your state site, but don’t count on it for everything.
For reporting on agencies or programs, keep an eye on the weekly progress reports
provided in the agency spreadsheets.

• DON’T
–
–
–
–
–

Try to do an accounting of the money. You’ll go crazy
Force everything to add up. It won’t
Depend on only one source
Depend on reporting to be very accurate at local levels.
Depend on employment estimates – they’re really bad.

Follow the flow of money
• Agency weekly summary reports
–
–

From recovery.gov or the agency recovery pages
Includes all spending, including employee salaries, overhead payments and transfers to and from
other agencies.

• USASpending (grants and loans)
–
–

From www.usaspending.gov,
www usaspending gov then choose “grants”
grants or “loans”
loans , one at a time
Includes all grants and loans reported by federal agencies, except those going directly to individuals.
(Unemployment insurance, for example, goes through states, but Social Security does not.) Updated
every two weeks.

• FPDS (contracts)
(
)
–

On recovery.gov, look under “Budget accounts” on the agency page
for a quick view of how much as been spent. What’s missing:
how much more there is to spend and exactly what it was for.

Or download the spreadsheets from
the “FAQs

center
pages, using “Agency Reported”
This gives you program totals by state,
type of spending (grants, salaries…)
and lets you track it by week.

DOJ says it has “obligated” nearly all of its allocation for this program, meaning it
has chosen the contracts, grants and other spending, and committed to paying
specific people, governments or companies.

• Obligations
Obli ti
Also called “amount available” or “in progress”, includes money that the
agencies have promised to recipients. They usually won’t pay it all until
they have documents showing the work was done and have a detailed
invoice breaking down the amounts. It is the standard measure of
spending at all levels of government because they are obligated to pay
unless they can show fraud or some other problem.
USASpending and other government systems use obligations.

• Outlays
Also called “spent” or “paid out”, includes only money that the Treasury has
actually paid out. Agencies often don’t know how much this is, but it is a
good measure of how much has actually moved into the physical
economy.

A few story ideas
• Look for stimulus moneyy simply
p y displacing
p
g existingg fundingg
streams – what did the states do with their own budgets? Did
Congress cut the regular budget for a program after the
stimulus?
• Concentrate on competitive and discretionary grants in your
state – are they going to the same old places? How has your
state fared in competitions? Why?
• Look at spending directly from the federal government, esp.
universities and large contracts
• Figure out overhead spending on government grants and
money flowing through various levels – how much just
disappears?
