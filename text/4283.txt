Sports - Nonprofits - Definitions
501(c): This is the designation by the Internal Revenue Service for tax-exempt non-profit
organizations. This tax-exempt status allows non-profit organizations to not pay taxes on revenue and
donations made to the non-profit are tax deductible.
Form 990: This is the name of the tax return that non-profit organizations file with the IRS. Non-profits
must, by law, make their three most recent years of 990 forms available for public viewing. You can
also see the most recent filings for free at guidestar.org. For a subscription fee, you can pay to view
records at guidestar that in some cases go back 10 years.
Total revenue: This is all the money, including donations and investment income, that comes in for the
year.
Total expenses: These are all the costs, including salaries, benefits and money given away, during the
year.

Sports - Definitions...continued
Revenue less expenses: This is the bottom line for the year. Like a successful private business, this
should be a positive number.
Net assets or fund balances: This is the total amount of money the non-profit has. This is a historical
measurement as money can accrue over time, and major non-profits like college bowl games could
have tens of millions of dollars in net assets or fund balances.
Reportable compensation: This is the salary, bonus or other income of employees. Make sure you
look to see if employees are getting compensation from organizations related to the non-profit. Also,
look at Schedule J to see if any of the officers are getting additional perks like first-class travel or
having their health club dues paid for by the non-profit. (That actually does occur).
Contractors: These are organizations that do business with a non-profit. A non-profit on Schedule O
has to list the compensation of its top five contractors. This is a good place to look to see if there are
questionable business relationships.

Metro
With so much free content competing for eyeballs, the challenge is learning
how to put these events in context. Reporters need to explain the implications
of a particular development. There is no better place to do that than in your own
backyard.
In every story you produce, you should be able to answer the following
question: How does what just happened relate to what is happening in the
larger landscape?

Metro - Jobs
Few issues generate greater interest than jobs. Jobs are an emotional issue. And in today’s
environment, workers who are lucky enough to have jobs are always looking over their shoulder to see
if they are going to be replaced. Meanwhile, workers who have lost their job are struggling to bounce
back.

Metro - Inflation
Prices are a classic pocketbook issue. People are always interested in what is happening with prices.
The federal government reports what is happening to consumer and producer prices each month.
Both indexes produce fodder for reporters who want to write local stories.

Metro - Housing
Everyone needs some place to live. Housing is also the single biggest purchase an individual will
make in his or her lifetime. New- and existing-housing sales, new-house starts and housing
foreclosures are tracked by the government and monitored closely. Why? Housing has a major impact
on other parts of the economy, most notably construction, home remodeling and retailing.
Every city, town and state is looking for the next big idea on how to grow and attract and retain new
jobs. Should local governments slash taxes? Or should officials relax regulations governing safety and
pollution? There is a constant push-pull here between government and the private sector that makes
for good local stories.

Metro - Transportation
Better known as planes, trains and automobiles. Commerce depends on people being able to get
around and get to work. Automobiles have become a fixture in American society. Cities are ringed
with expressways. Once a nation of railroads, most freight now travels by road and air. Without
efficient transportation, the economy grinds to a halt.

US Securities and Exchange Commission

SEC: 10-K Filings
10-K is the annual report filed with the US Securities and
Exchange Commission for publicly traded companies (20F for foreign companies).
-

-

Often the most comprehensive view of a company
available.
Fact-based document, from perspective of management
Includes: Financial report card for previous year (income
and cash flow statements), overview of the company’s
financial health (balance sheet and shareholder’s equity
statement), properties, market performance, etc. Also
http://www.sec.
includes lawsuits, regulatory inquiries and other risks.
gov/Archives/edgar/data/7286/000110465914
Compare to previous year’s filing.
012068/a13-25897_110k.htm

SEC: 10-Q Filing
Quarterly filings for publicly traded companies, also found on EDGAR
-

Basically a three-month progress report
NOT a company’s quarterly earning report
Easy to get lost in jargon, keep an eye on details – negative aspects of the report.

EX: http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/7286/000076462214000022/a09301410-q.htm

SEC: 8-K Filings
Filed, basically, whenever something is of timely value to shareholders or investors.
-

8-K filings are essentially “current.”
Precipitated by anything from the death of a senior executive to the signing of a new contract to
selling off assets to releasing an earnings report.
Don’t ignore them
