Tabula is a tool that lets you take data tables out of PDFs. (It’s not the same as Tableau, which is a data visualization tool.) You also need to have a “text-based” file — if you can select the text inside it, you’re
probably in good shape.

Tabula was built with support by ProPublica and La Nacion (Argentina) and the Knight-Mozilla OpenNews program.

We’re also lucky to have received a Knight Prototype grant to continue working on it this year, and we’re lucky to work in newsrooms that let us improve
the program. Tabula is a tool built by journalists, originally for journalism problems.

PDF is the worst possible format for
data exchange.
“Portable Document Format” is electronic paper,
meant to be rendered the same way
regardless of the device.
PDF cares about the form, we just
care about the content.

Ever try to copy a table out of a PDF file?

Unfortunately, PDFs are
regularly used for publishing
important information.

Why can’t you just ask for
Excel (or other raw data)?

Sometimes you get data from private organizations and this PDFs of data tables are all they provide. In this case, there’s no pathway to asking for raw
data.

In other countries, you might have issues like this too: Congressional voting records in Argentina were recently provided only as PDF reports.

Why is data published
in PDF?

Ignorance

Malice

“The crime stats are subject to being corruptible in an
excel sheet. They have been changed in the past by
persons unknown and this affects the veracity of the
original data posted. If stats are posted on-line in a
PDF format, this reduces the risk of contamination.
[...] Effective immediately the stats should just be
posted in a PDF format.”

● “Text-based” PDFs
○ Can select text inside the file.
○ PDF stores exact positions of every character on the page.
○ Tabula can take this text information & return the data.
● Scanned PDFs
○ Just a collection of images.
○ PDF file doesn’t actually contain the text you’re seeing.
○ Tabula can’t do anything about these unless the file is
processed with OCR software first. (Watch out for accuracy!)
