NICAR Annual Conference, Newark, N.J., March 2006
First, some basics:
-- It’s not just coal: There are 2,000 coal mines nationwide, but more
than 12,500 metal/nonmetal mines. Find out what kind of mines there are
in your coverage area. Visit the U.S. Mine Safety and Health
Administration’s website, at
http://www.msha.gov/drs/DRSextendedSearch.asp, and you can search for a
list of mines by state, county, MSHA district (there’s a maps of the
districts at http://www.msha.gov/district/disthome.htm), and commodity.
Also visit the National Mining Association’s statistics page,
http://www.nma.org/statistics_index.asp. Especially check out their
annual Facts about Coal and Facts about Minerals publications.

-- Learn about mine safety and mining terminology: Pennsylvania’s DEP

provides a pretty good glossary at
http://www.dep.state.pa.us/dep/deputate/minres/dms/website/training/glo
ssary.html. MSHA provides the text of the federal statute and
regulations, http://www.msha.gov/regsinfo.htm. NIOSH has tons of
research on mining issues, http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/mining/.
Then, get the safety records:

-- Use MSHA’s data retrieval system: This is the most powerful tool you
have to cover mining accidents when they occur in your area.
Online at http://www.msha.gov/drs/drshome.htm
To review a specific mine’s record, get the mine name, company
name or (preferably) the seven-digit MSHA Mine ID Number. Search by one
of those choice, then first read the Mine Overview, which gives you
basic information on employees, production, accidents and violation
history.
Then, look at the most recent inspections; especially those
listed as “Regular Health and Safety” inspections, which are required
four times per year for underground mines. You can also pull up a list
of accidents and -- most importantly -- a list of violations. When you
get the violations, always download the webpage and import into into
Excel. Once you clean it up there, it’s much easier to analyze. Look
for trends in the kinds of violations -- roof control, ventilation
plan, etc. Look especially for citations listed as “104(d)” orders -among the most serious actions MSHA inspectors can take against an
operator.
Look into any fatalities that occurred at the mine. The Mine
Overview will give you a list of fatalities each year. Then, go to
http://www.msha.gov/fatals/fab.htm, and search under the appropriate
commodity and year. For older fatalities, the MSHA library has an
online archive and can provide the reports,
http://www.msha.gov/TRAINING/LIBRARY/FatalRecordsSearch.asp.
Make sure to look up other mines operated by the same company.
Search under the company’s name for other mines. Check its website for
parent company and subsidiary names. For great information about who
owns coal companies, call the U.S. Office of Surface Mining’s
Application Violator System at 1-800-643-9748, and ask them to fax you
an “Organizational Family Tree” for the company.
-- Follow the regulatory process: Has the Bush administration made
mining regulations weaker? Find out. Read MSHA’s regulatory agendas
online at http://www.msha.gov/regsinfo.htm or
http://www.gpoaccess.gov/ua/index.html. Comments on past and current
rules are available at http://www.msha.gov/currentcomments.asp, and
transcripts of public hearings are at http://www.msha.gov/tscripts.htm.
