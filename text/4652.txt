How You Can Track
U.S. Military and Police Aid
A Guide for Media Professionals

Background
 U.S. government is dramatically increasing military

aid, moving from $5 billion in FY 2001 to $19.2
billion in FY 2015.

 It’s difficult to see where the money is going because

the numbers are funded through scores of different
funds and diverse sources.

 Security Assistance Monitor (SAM) launched in 2014

to increase transparency, debate, and oversight of an
often risky foreign policy tool.
