Midwest Watchdog Workshop April 2015

Taming environmental and
agricultural reporting
http://bit.ly/1FmvCXk

This tipsheet is here: ​

1. Learn how big trends in policy and markets shape the
environment.
­
­
­

Trade/specialty publications — like the Milkweed
National publications
Scientific journals

2. Use data to help report, broaden, verify and show the story.

Enforcement records
Impaired waterways
National ​
Toxics Release Inventory
Clean Water Act mandated reports to Congress​
or ​
GCC reports to the
Legislature​
tips on what is being collected and (their idea of) the state of the
science
DNR ​
research agendas​
or ​
lists of funded projects
Lists of problems (contaminated wells, brownfields, landfills)
National Agricultural Statistics Service
EPA’s ​
echo.gov​
: Drinking water, air, hazardous waste, water violations and fines
Search by facility​
Beware of data quality problems!
Economic Research Service​
: Environment, Big Ag, ​
GMOs​
, more
USDA’s ​
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service​
: Tasked with protecting “the
health and value of American agriculture and natural resources.” Monitors and
controls risks from plant pests, outbreaks. If there is an outbreak, APHIS tries to
monitor and control it. In the past decades, the agency’s role has expanded to
include GMO and animal welfare. Issues permits (not entirely public) to entities
using regulated animals, animal products, crops or crop products.

Key data:​
Biotechnology announcements​

Table of all petitions​
*|​
FOIA
logs​
|​
Information Systems for Biotechnology*
­ Media contact:​
(​
​
list​
depending on office; topic)
­ “Information Systems for biotechnology” database allows visitors to search
for all permits and notifications. A visitor can search by a specific crop or
can search by a specific institution.
Scout from The Sunlight Foundation​
to keep up with issues and big ag
companies
Changedetection.com​
to follow changes in agency and other websites
Edgar​

3. Improve environmental sourcing.

Farmers are part of the solution as well as the problem — and they are far from
homogeneous.
Citizens are often way more on top of issues than state officials
Scientists can often point to solutions. Particularly good: USGS,
Champaign­Urbana, UW­Madison. But understand their context and potential
blind spots, too ­­ agronomy departments often funded by Big Ag, while
environmental scientists sometimes fail to connect with farmers.
Look at what's being done elsewhere. Our template: What's Minnesota doing
(usually better)? State comparisons: ncsl.org
State and federal court documents

4. Go see the problem.
5. Get on top of the science.
­
­
­
­

Read scientific journal articles. You won’t understand everything. That’s OK.
“Best practices" often bandied about, but what do they really do?
Contaminants of emerging concern are ... emerging.
Appropriate risk communication: Ask sources to rank a problem with other
problems. Listen to scientists when they say they don't really know how much of
a problem something is — and communicate that uncertainty.

­

Think big. We need to do a better job of communicating long­term problems and
report on long­term solutions.

6. Tell people's stories.
­
­

What do people living in agricultural areas see, hear, smell, feel and taste?
What are people's hopes and dreams — a clean well? Being able to pass the
family farm on to their children?
