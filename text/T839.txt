What happened next?

n 1998

n Trouw publishes an update

n The inspection of the ministry of education starts to publish

school performance data
n New government: schools should be judged publicly and
independently

The situation today

n Social scientist: Should school data be a secret again?
n Primary school data still partially secret
n Both Trouw and the inspection publish school performance

data annually

Debate in social science

n It is our duty to society to co-operate in ranking schools
n We should not co-operate as long as the data are not

adequate
n And the winner is ...

Primary school data still partially secret

n 1998

n Start of a legal procedure using public information laws

n 2000

n Court decision

n The inspection starts to gather and publish test results of a

sample of primary schools

Both Trouw and the inspection publish
schooldata every year

n Why not leave it to the inspection?

n Keep the pressure on schools, inspection and other parties
n Follow up of earlier data analyses
n Trouw-method easier to read
n Reminder of a success story

Problems repeating the project

n The image of CAR-projects: “l.o.r”
n Boredom
n High expectations from your editor

Solution: Be on the front page every year
n Don’t be too thorough in your analysis

n Collect more data to relate to school performance:
n The age and sex of teachers

n Teacher shortage/cancelation of lessons
n Truancy

n Follow-up: Do Montessori schools perform better this year? Etc.

Examples of front page stories

n Schools with a Maria Montessori identity perform badly (1997)
n Students who stay down a class are the drop outs of the future

(1998)
n Schools that put too many students in the highest school level
perform badly (1999)
n Schools with many senior teachers perform better than others
(2000)
n Montessori schools improved their performance (2001)
