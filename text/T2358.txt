Every-year Census!

What to expect
It looks like there’s no turning back. After years in pilot mode, the Census Bureau has shifted to full
production on the American Community Survey (http://www.census.gov/acs). In January 2005, the
bureau began mailing forms that will reach 3 million households by year’s end.
(http://www.census.gov/acs/www/Downloads/SQuest05.pdf). Unlike the decennial censuses of decades
past, new ACS estimates will be released every year.
There will be no 2010 Census long form. From now on, most of the demographic data that journalists care most
about – income, education, school enrollment, commuting, migration, immigration and housing – will come from
the ACS each year. The 24-page ACS questionnaire is very similar to the 2000 Census long form.
In August 2006, the bureau will release the first of the annual estimates for areas with at least 65,000 people. This
will be the equivalent of a decennial census worth of “characteristic” data. If you covered Census 2000 and are
familiar with its files: It’s like a new and complete SF3 every year.
By rolling together three years of such sampling, the bureau will release a 2005-07 data snapshot in August 2008
for any area with at least 20,000 people. And doing the same thing across five years, it will offer a 2005-10 data
snapshot in August 2011 for every census tract in the nation.

Changes in local coverage
All of this suggests a big shift in how newsrooms manage Census reporting. Because census releases will be
annual, they may lose some of their built-in newsworthiness that the decennial releases have commanded.
Similarly, there will be no summary files or ancillary releases, so there will also be less scrambling to cover
evolving data.

Planning checklist
¾ Media Tool Kit: http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/2004/NewsMediaKit.html
¾ Be comforted that the ACS coverage process will get easier each year
¾ Familiarize yourself with the questionnaire
¾ Isolate and rank the demographic issues most important to your community
¾ Think about the new opportunities annual data brings. For example: Armed with a new poverty rate for your

city each year, what might city hall reporter do?
Archive 2002/2003 ACS data for your area and/or state
Begin compiling 2002/2003 queries and spreadsheets on priority topics, or pull tables from American
FactFinder (factfinder.census.gov) so that you don’t have to do it on deadline
Understand your area’s sample size for 2002/2003 and newer releases
Locate GIS boundary files and brief graphic artists early

Opportunities
¾ Spot: Address your highest priority stories first
¾ Enterprise: Scrutinize trends, do bi-/multivariate analysis, apply data to public records investigations
¾ Trending: ACS data will get better with yearly data, including commuting, poverty, homeownership, housing
costs, veteran status, school enrollment and presence of children

¾ Non-census beats: Use data to complement transportation, education, neighborhood and housing beats and to be
more informed about communities
¾ Promote newsroom numeracy and community understanding with “snapshot” analysis of interesting crosssections
¾ Redefine ACS data as a dynamic resource to texturize non-census dailies

Liabilities
¾ Reader fatigue / number glut
¾ Staff shortages
¾ Longer wait for data on smaller areas, group quarters
¾ ACS methodology – rolling averages and estimates

Dress rehearsal
You have one last chance for a full-scale rehearsal. The 2004 ACS data will be released this August.
Because it included only 800,000 households nationwide, it will only offer results for areas with more than 250,000
people: states, large cities, counties and some other areas like congressional districts, metros and American Indian
reservations. Take a look at the 2003 results (http://www.census.gov/acs/www/Products/index.htm) to see what’s
offered.

ACS Entry points / stealth demographics
The San Diego Union-Tribune has used ACS data to cover the foreign born, migration trends between southern
California counties, poverty and even energy consumption. But its biggest use of the census and ACS data has
come from incorporating it into non-census stories – both spot and enterprise – to understand the people we write
about and how the issues we report affect them. Paul calls this “stealth demographics.”

People: In California, the population has diversified dramatically since 1990. In an evolving demographic

v

climate, where the Hispanic population is expected to become a majority, a decade is a long
time to wait for population updates. In San Diego County, we have reported that almost 1 out
of 3 persons is Hispanic. A similar proportion of the population is foreign-born. Another
significant cluster is linguistically isolated in their households. Each of these trends is
somewhat related to other trends important in San Diego: density, educational attainment and
home ownership, among others.

In your own town, what are the specialized populations? Which demographic groups carry important cultural
meanings? If it’s not a racial or ethnic group, ancestry or foreign-born population, it could be an industry or
occupation or unions. It could be the working-class or the poor or a gentrified inner city.
You will have entry points in almost any story to better explain the group and the ACS is a fantastic tool. For
example, if you were writing about the strength of a teacher’s union in the community, you could insert the figures
for the number of teachers in the population, the number of households with children and the educational
attainment levels of the population to illustrate scope and constituency. Or if you were writing about the state’s
biggest coal mine or auto plant closing, you could use the ACS to report the number of households potentially
affected and where your state ranks for people in these industries.

Households: Don’t think that the ACS would have anything to do with studying utilities? Think again. When

+

the Union-Tribune’s Homes section evaluated energy use for a feature, it used ACS figures to
show how much of the population used electricity, solar energy or no heat at all. (Hey, it’s
San Diego). Instead of talking to experts uniquely, we looked to the survey figures.

Similarly, the ACS will tell you how much people pay for energy and water, whether
households have complete plumbing facilities, functional kitchens with appliances, or land
line telephone service. You can also determine how many households have second mortgages
and how many no vehicles, or five.

With any of this data, you may not be able to write a big story, but you could inform an existing idea to write more
authoritatively. With the ACS, you can do either simple annual trending (e.g., costs of utilities), test observed
consumer “trends” (cell phone vs. land-line use), or use the data to help evaluate quality of life issues (how many
homes lack basic services). In Southern California, where thousands of residents suffered from the 2003 firestorms,
it would helpful to compare the median cost of home fire insurance across counties and determine if there was a
significant increase between pre- and post-fire years.

User friendly
If you struggled with slicing apart the 2000 Census data, you’ll appreciate how the bureau has made ACS data
much more user-friendly:

~ One big advance: The 90% confidence interval around each number is built right into each table. (With
apologies to purists for taking some liberties: Statistical theory says that if a survey were taken many, many
times, the number would fall between that “upper bound” and “lower bound” 90% of the time.) In this example,
the number in question is called an
“estimate,” the cautious and proper term that
social scientists use for any survey results.
The upper and lower bounds tell you not to
make a big deal out of the last three digits in
the estimate – you could even report it in the
paper as “62,000.” Also: When you see a
number reported for consecutive years, look at the overlap at the respective bounds. The less the overlap, the
more likely the trend is real and not just an artifact of the sampling process.

~ Multi-year tables: Comparing 1990 and 2000 census data is a major exercise, even when the categories are
comparable. But for ACS, the bureau produces multi-year tables so you can see at-a-glance how something like
the poverty rate has been trending. Even
better, the bureau has flagged older estimates
that have a statistically significant difference
from the most recent number – they carry an
asterisk. You can see at-a-glance where a
trend is real or spotty.

Cautions for the transition
1. Temporary: ACS won’t include group quarters – prisons, dorms, barracks, etc. – until 2006 data (released in
August 2007). Until then, it’s still a survey of households. As a result, it will paint a slightly incomplete picture,
since nationwide about 3% of Americans live in group quarters. Be especially careful if you live in a college and
military town, where the group quarters population can be significant. For now, the bureau’s annual population
estimates (http://www.census.gov/popest/estimates.php) and censuses remain the official stats.
In general, ACS will work well in describing anything that is household-specific – family income or linguistic
isolation – and for some subjects that are usually household-specific –commuting, occupation and industry, rent,
etc. Use your knowledge of you town and your judgment when reporting these figures.
2. Permanent: Census 2000 asked where each person lived on April 1.That single-day snapshot won’t be

possible for ACS because its survey forms will be filled out through the year. Instead, the Census Bureau
is using a two-month rule: If you have lived somewhere for two months, you should be counted there
under ACS. This will affect totals for some kinds of places – especially resort and college towns.
