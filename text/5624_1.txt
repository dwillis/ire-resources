Finding “Brady Officers:” The cops prosecutors label as problematic witnesses
IRE Conference | 06.14.2018
By Mark Fazlollah
In scandal after scandal, prosecutors have learned the high costs of allowing untrustworthy
police to testify in criminal cases.
Whether it’s Philadelphia, where 2,000 convictions have been overturned in recent years,
or in other major cities, prosecutors usually have lists of the cops they don’t want in court.
Those on the lists are best known as Brady Officers, referring the Supreme Court’s 1963
Brady v Maryland decision requiring that prosecutors disclose information about tainted
cops to defense lawyers.
How do reporters get these lists, or at least to identify some of offices on the roster?
1) The King County prosecutor’s office in Seattle has made its list public for more than
a decade. At least 10 other counties in Washington have released lists. In Florida, at
least two judicial circuit offices of the State Attorney also have released lists. Most
of this has been done with open records requests.
2) In Philadelphia, the Inquirer got the early information from people who knew about
the list and were willing to talk about the cops. Just having one or two names can
make for an interesting story about the list held by a local prosecutor.
3) The Philadelphia public defender’s office broke loose the full list by convincing a
judge that there had been a pattern of abuse by the former District Attorney in
refusing to release Brady information. The court ruled that the full list was Brady
material and it should be provided to the defense in that case.
The Philadelphia list contained the names of 66 officers. It’s available at:

Philadelphia serves as a good example of how important these rosters can be. After a March
court-ordered release of 66 officers’ names, defense attorney filed more than 6,000
petitions for new trials. Court now are reviewing many of those convictions and reversing
some of them.
Some details on prosecutors’ effort comply with the Brady rules are available at Fair and
Just Prosecution: https://fairandjustprosecution.org/
It touts itself as bringing together newly-elected local prosecutors to develop a better
criminal justice system. The group gives its model for comply with the Brady requirements

Florida and Washington.
