Scraping the web
IRE Conference 2011 - Orlando, FL

Why scraping?

•

Data is dispersed among lots of different locations
or across many different pages, or in PDF format

•

Too time consuming to do it manually

•

The paranoid government official: “previous experience of
mischievous manipulation and misrepresentation”

•

Scoop the competition

Before you scrape

• Try the organisation that holds the original data
• Has anyone else done the work already?
• Can you do it yourself or do you need help?
• Have a strategy
• Best case / worst case story: is it worth it?

Open data campaigners are cracking open the vault …
• Political, corporate, economic data
• Free and reusable and useable

Europe’s Hidden Billions – results from the data

• Some of the biggest corporate beneficiaries are multinationals
• E.g. IBM, Fiat;
• funding for tobacco companies, McDonalds, Pharma companies
• Millions of Euros spent subsidising companies that are relocating from
one member state to another (against EU rules)
• One of the biggest UK beneficiaries was a company providing welfare
to work services which we could prove was underperforming on contracts
