CHALLENGES
•

No obvious link between SUPs and accidents

•

No easily identifiable data or tracking

•

No clear issue crying out to be addressed

•

Many stakeholders deny there is even a problem

•

Need to know about how airplanes work and have working
knowledge of what parts do when installed on airplanes

•

“Insider” baseball

•

Where’s the beef? Where is proof this is even an issue?

How We Did It
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Searched FAA “UnApproved Parts” (SUPs) Notifications
Built our own database of previously citied companies
“Googled” .pdf documents specifically with “unapproved”
Found previous “unfound” documents from FAA to various
companies
Site survey and search of eBay and on-line aviation parts
Bought parts off Internet – paid close attention to claims of
legitimacy and for use in airplanes
Requested copy of all investigations and associated reports
Tracked companies whose name came up repeatedly
Talked to human sources – mechanics, pilots

THINGS TO REMEMBER
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Ask questions no one else is asking
Don’t forget lawsuits
Try various sources of data/information, various angles on story
Find stakeholders who may not be “obvious” such as independent
researchers, GA pilots, attorneys – no “obvious” deaths or ties
between accidents and SUPs chased many other journalists away –
they decided not to do story
Go to Congress or State\Local Lawmakers
Conduct Google searches for .pdf’s which can lead elsewhere
Don’t take “no” for an answer, be persistent and relentless
Remember you are working on behalf of those people who don’t
have voice, who lost loved ones or whose own safety\life could be
at stake
