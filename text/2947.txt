USING THE WEB TO GET MILLIONS TO WATCH YOUR INVESTIGATION
IRE National Conference – Phoenix, Arizona – June 7-10, 2007
Matt Goldberg, KNBC-TV

A good viral spread on the Internet is a very hard thing to create. But when it happens to
one of your stories, the size of your audience can exceed all expectations and offer your
work visibility that it probably has never had before. Just like a good investigative story,
it takes time and planning to try and pull it off.

Try a few of these techniques:

Dedicated Web Pages
Create a website that is the go to place for your investigative project. Allow visitors to
see all of the parts of the investigation that have aired on TV as well as read transcripts.
You also want to create added material to the site like extended clips of interviews, chat
boards, links to useful information and commentary on how you did the investigation.
Examples:

http://www.knbc.com/homedepotinvestigation/index.html
http://www.knbc.com/mechanicinvestigation/index.html
http://www.knbc.com/producemarketinvestigation/index.html

Preview Video Clips
Video clips can spread like wildfire on the web. One concept that has been successful at
getting the word out about an investigation for us at KNBC is creating preview clips of an
investigation and posting them on video specific sites. YouTube, Google and AOL video,
just to name a few, are great ways to reach an audience. Basically, you want to cut
together a small package that gives people a taste of what your investigation uncovered.
Then, simply post it on video specific sites. This can prove to be very effective at
creating a buzz about a story before it even airs.
Example:

Here’s a tip - create several accounts and publish the video clip with all of them. The
more clips you have out there, the greater chance that people will find it.

Gong Directly to Your Audience
When you do a story that has broad appeal, consider reaching out for the audience. Focus
on websites that will deliver viewers interested in the topic of your story. Here are a few
examples:
 The Consumerist – Blog styled site that focuses on consumer related issues.
http://consumerist.com/
 Fark – Millions of people check this site daily for news and topic specific
information. You basically make a brief description of your story and provide a
link bringing people back to your website and your story.
http://www.fark.com/
 Digg – Similar to Fark. http://digg.com/
 Drudge Report – If you end up as a link on this page, you will get millions of
hits. http://drudgereport.com/
 Group Sites – Think about who would be interested in your story. Go to bulletin
board sites like Google Groups (http://groups.google.com/) and Yahoo Groups
(http://groups.yahoo.com/). Here’s an example of a Yahoo Group focused on
Home Depot: http://finance.groups.yahoo.com/group/homedepotafterhours/
 My Space –Create a page for a specific stories or for your investigative team and
watch how many people become friends of your site.
http://myspace.com/ also try http://www.facebook.com/
 Direct Email - A lot of us have tip lines that we use to get stories from viewers. If
you have it in a database form a simple computer-assisted query can actually
extract all of the emails from tipsters and provide you with a huge mailing list of
people who are interested in your work. Send them a mass email telling them
about your upcoming projects.
