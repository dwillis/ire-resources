Attorneys General’s offices (public in many states, see spreadsheet) Examples of
products and services complained about: Chain letters, campgrounds, pet breeders,
dating services, work-at-home employment, hospital billing, scuba-diving lessons,
airlines, electricity, and charities, to name a few.
Federal Trade Commission’s Consumer Sentinel
http://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/consumer-sentinel-network
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on banks, mortgages, student loans, creditreporting agencies, debt collectors. Warning: the data lacks narratives to explicitly
explain the problem. http://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaintdatabase/
U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission http://www.cpsc.gov/en/Research-Statistics/ IRE also offers this data for sale to members.
State utility regulators. You wouldn’t believe how many complaints such agencies
receive about power outages.
State licensing boards. For every doctor, nurse, teacher, insurance agent who loses his or
her license to practice, there is a complaint behind that action.
Equal Employment Opportunity Complaint Data: http://www.archives.gov/eeo/
In the education world, special-education complaints, due process rulings and some
other info are publicly available and often are posted on state Ed Departments' websites.
In Ohio's case, you can search for complaints by district. So it's sometimes a good way to

spot districts that are struggling with educating kids with a certain disability, or where
parents are particularly unhappy. Here's Ohio's site:
http://education.ohio.gov/Topics/Special-Education/Mediation-Complaints-and-DueProcess/Complaint-and-Due-Process-Databases
Food safety complaints (not public in all states, though)
Home health care/hospice complaints
The FCC maintains a database of complaints about network programming
Americans with Disabilities Act complaints (about not providing accessible facilities)
The FCC, FAA and other federal agencies maintain their own complaint logs.
Some cities now even put complaints online. Boston, for instance, has data for everyone
who calls the 311 hotline about everything from complaints about noisy bars to
potholes. https://data.cityofboston.gov/
This is not exactly a consumer complaint database, but http://www.askapatient.com/
for getting info on drug reactions from unidentified consumers.
SEC EDGAR database http://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/webusers.htm
10-K filings are required to list lawsuits against the company – you can find if there are
class-action or consumer investigations going on.
