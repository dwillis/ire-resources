On the beat: sports journalism

What makes a great sports story?
1) Great characters: People tell stories. Viewers won’t care about your stories
unless they care about the people in your stories. News is not about issues and
events, it’s about how issues and events affect people.
2) Focus: What’s your purpose? Pick a path and stick to it. Be relentless in your
quest. If a story element strays from your focus, leave it out. The strength of a
story is measured not by what you include but rather by what you have the
courage to leave out.
3) Structure: All good stories have a beginning, middle and ending. The time to
recognize and mold these essential building blocks is when you are in the hunting
and gathering phase, not when the last frame of video is shot.
4) Emotion/Conflict/Surprises: Find the emotion, conflict and surprises in your
stories. Build to surprises and, to the extent possible, let characters reveal them.
5) Writing: All good writing comes from detail. Pay attention to the little things.
Write less. Writing is about a blank piece of paper and leaving out what’s not
supposed to be there.

What makes a great sports investigation?
1) Cultivate Human Sources: Invest the time and, whenever possible, meet sources
face-to-face.
2) Don’t Throw People Away: Compile and keep an organized and comprehensive
list of contacts. Circle back with sources to get that second and third layer of
knowledge.
3) Trust Nobody… But be Trustworthy: If your mother tells you she loves you,
check it out! Be a man of your word.
4) Be Relentless: Never be left with “What ifs?”
5) Why Should Anyone Care? If you can’t answer that question, that’s a problem!
