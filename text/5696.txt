and disinformation

Example: Identifying Source Hacking - The Disinformation: Parkland shooter Nikolas
Cruz trained with fringe far-right group Republic of Florida
Link to the original story on the Storyful blog
- Trolls spread disinformation about the Parkland shooter’s affiliation with the right-wing,
anti-Semitic group Republic of Florida in an organized disinformation tactic called
“source hacking.”
- White nationalists/trolls posted fake comments to the shooter’s Instagram page
pretending to know him, leading journalists to reach out to them. They redirected
journalists to call the spokesman for ROF - Jordan Jereb, who was in on it.
- ADL researchers identified 4chan posts tying the suspected shooter to the ROF, which
they used to further corroborate their own claim about the shooter’s organizational
affiliation and other media outlets went with it.
- Storyful identified conversations across TRS504 forums, Discord, Gab, and 4chan
about the spread of false background information on Nicholas Cruz.

==============================================================
Three basic rules:
1. Trust your gut
2. Investigate context clues
3. Be patient
1. Trust your gut
Take a broad look at where the information seems to be coming from, do basic research,
and evaluate the context clues.
- Who first reported the information?
- In this example, The Anti-Defamation League were the first to report it after
speaking with Jordan Jereb, the ROF spokesman. So this is a fringe, far right, openly
anti-Semitic group giving information to the ADL. Using your base intuition, how likely do
you think ROF is to be helpful and truthful in this situation? This is a red flag.
- Clues about proximity
- ROF claimed that Nikolas Cruz was had trained with them. ROF is based in

Tallahassee, almost a 7-hour drive from Parkland. It’s certainly possible that he could
have made the trip, but unlikely. This is a red flag.
2. Context clues and post history
Look at all available context clues, especially those on the periphery. Trolls posted
comments on Cruz’s Instagram purposefully intended to mislead journalists, but clues on
their profiles and posts can help you identify their true game.
– Take a look at everyone’s online presence to get a sense of who they are and what
they’re up to (history of trolling, geo-locatable posts, tagged posts, identifiable features).
- What’s the chatter on the forums? You’re likely to find people talking about the
disinformation effort - but be careful! The forums are a minefield of disinformation
themselves. Cross-reference and use peripheral context clues to see the truth.
Is there any information about Cruz’s daily life before the shooting? Check for clues on
any available social accounts/online footprint (check-ins, tagged posts, posts about
plans, geo-locatable photos or video).
- Look at the periphery: search known associates - friends, family, etc.
- The person themselves may have all their social locked up, especially if they
planned to do something bad, but their dad, grandma, cousin, friend, etc, probably
doesn’t and there may be clues about your person of interest there.
- Take screenshots. Always assume that what you see will be gone as soon as you
refresh. The Wayback Machine can help you.
- Trust no one. Assume that anyone you try to talk to will actively troll you and give you
false info, especially if you identify yourself as a member of the media.
3. Be patient
The best, and hardest, thing you can possibly do is wait. It is better to be right than fast.
- Trolls usually eventually out themselves, or each other, and own up to the “prank.” You
may see instances of them congratulating or accusing each other in the forums. In our
example all three occurred.
- Take the time to corroborate with local law enforcement - they’re the ones who will
have been keeping an eye on groups like ROF and affiliated persons.
Obviously we all know the pressures of the news cycle - you need to get the story out
fast. But in these situations a little patience and extra-thorough investigating can save
you a retraction and stop disinformation from spreading.
