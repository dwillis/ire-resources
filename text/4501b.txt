DAVID BOARDMAN, TEMPLE U
**BOARDMAN
- Trust in Journalists at all time low according to gallup poll
- New challenges with emerging technologies and ethical challenges of
sourcing
- ROLLING STONE – A RAPE ON CAMPUS – provided primer of what NOT to do
such as editors using pseudonyms and not naming sources
- JUDITH MILLER – admits she was wrong because her sources were
wrong…bottom line she was wrong
- LOSE WEIGHT EATING CHOCOLOATE
*CONCERNS
- ANONYMOUS SOUIRCES
- very important and must be preserved but cannot be gratuitous and
shouldn’t be used too freely
- don’t let them smear someone without putting their name behind it
- be specific about the source without identifying them by name…tell
them something about the person and their motivation so there is
some degree of transparency
- always best for people to be on the record, especially with lower stakes
involved
****if source is wrong then YOU are wrong (ie. Newtown shooter…law enforcement
gave wrong name of shooter)
****-In delicate source situations, ask yourself and colleagues these questions:
*is there no other way to get the info? Have I exhausted all other methods /
sources?
*Can I get source documents that could possibly enable me to do story without using
unnamed source?
What do I know about sources credibility?
*have I maximized the level of identification without revealing sources identity?
*What is sources motivation? Motiviation for anonymity?
*have I done due diligence in learning everything I can about the source without
compromising their identity?
- PROTECTION AND HANDLING OF SOURCES
- PAYING SOURCES

*general practice never pay sources for information or interviews
*there are rare cases where it is appropriate…such as when someone’s safe passage
can be made.
*this is public service not employment for the source
- SOURCE REVIEW OF CONTENT
*are there potential benfits to allowing a source to review portions or all of story
before air/publication
*are there potential pitfalls?
*how will I respond if source wants to change something in story? Or revise a quote?
*what if source wants to retract comments / info?
*should different standards apply to media savvy sources vs. non-savvy sources?
- BREAKING NEWS SOURCING
*before I report or tweet something reported how confident am I in the accuracy?
*would I potentially cause harm if I reported this before 100% sure of accuracy?
*is there harm in not reporting it when I’m not 100% sure?
*have I questioned first hand accounts that can be inaccurate, manipulative, or
shaped by emotion, bad memory, or limited perspective?
*have I checked the info with other sources?
*can I report the information but indicate the info is preliminary and fluid?
- SOCIAL MEDIA SOURCING
*Am I comfortable repeating what others are reporting, even if I attribute?
*have I corroborated the origin, location, date/time, of images and content?
*have I obtained permission to use original material?
*have I given credit to sources?
*are there legal or copyright issues?
*have I verified social media profiles?
*is the account holder known to me? Have they been reliable in the past?
*am I confident there have been no reality offering alterations? (ie photoshop)

3 TYPES OF INTERVIEWS THAT CAN BE HARD TO GET:
*THE VICTIM/FAMILY/PROTAGONIST
*INSIDER OR KEY SOURCE
*RELUCTANT OR OBSTRUCTIONIST OFFICIAL
*VICTIM / PROTAGONIST
- do homework, get to know the family’s background and what the person was like
- make sure you know everything about the case
- try to meet them in person
**DON’T OVER PROMISE
**ONLY PLEDGE TO TELL STORY TRUTHFULLY AND ACCURATELY AND NOTHING
MORE
**IF YOU ARE GOING TO MEET WITH VICTIM CONSIDER DOING THAT WITH
OTHER SIDE
- address reluctance head on and get their concerns, understand them, and explain
the importance of them speaking out and why people need to hear their voice
- be up front about everything you’ll cover in the story
- no questions in advance but give them an idea of what to expect
*REAL TALK
- be human first, journalist 2nd
- share a little about your self but focus on learning more about them
- show empathy and understanding and know your story isn’t the most important
thing in their life
- use your surroundings to generate conversation and ease tension
*STRENGTH IN NUMBERS
- your research can help persuade the subject, help them know they are not alone,
their story can help others

*THE INSIDER / KEY SOURCE
-many same techniques as victims
- they’re reluctance may be greater because of fallout/repercussion
-figure out what motivates them
-address risks/concerns
-appeal to their sense of right and wrong
- you’re in a uniques position, if you don’t talk who will? How will this get
out?
*RELUCTANT OFFICIAL
*OFFICIALS SHOULD GO ON CAMERA AND BE TRANSPARENT, STATEMENTS ARE
UNACCEPTABLE
*ASK POLITELY AND BE PERSISTENT
*AFTER CALLS AND EMAILS, SEND A LETTER LETTING THEM KNOW ALL YOU’VE
DONE TO TRY TO GET THEM TO TALK AND THAT IF THEY REFUSE THEN WE CAN
CATCH UP WITH YOU IN A PUBLIC SETTING
*THE SIT DOWN INTERVIEW IS ALWAYS BETTER FOR THE STORY THAN
CONFRONTATION UNSCHEDULED
**COMPLETE TRANSPARENCY WITH WHAT YOU’RE REPORTING WORKS
**EXPLAIN WHY THEY “HAVE TO” TALK AND EXPLAIN TO THE PUBLIC
**ALWAYS BE POLITE, CALM, AND RESPECTFUL
**ASK FOR THE OFFICIAL’S PUBLIC SCHEDULE IF THEY CONTINUE TO DENY
*EVEN IF YOU HAVE TO DO CONFRONTATION, CONTINUE TO ASK FOR A SIT
DOWN
**RELUCTANT ANTAGONIST
- meet in person, go knock on door
- explain you want their side of the story and why its important
- be transparent
- establish trust, point them to your work

 In TAG invite viewers to help bring others forward
 Monitor social media for follow up tips
 Advance story and explain how
QUALITY AND QUANTITY
Raziq, Aaron Diamont, John Ferrugia
**Over last 5 years more of a push to involve investigators in daily / breaking news.
The demand for quantity has risen.
**Research shows audiences want investigative content. But they have short
attention spans.
**You’re no good to your station or your market if you’re not on the air. You want
your audience to see you and connect with you, contact you, not the competition.
-Keep the pipeline full
- PIR’s, follow ups, etc
**School Shooting story

- checked with state agency for weapons reported to sate and assaults
**Knowing where to go to find it fast during breaking news events
**Who do you know? What sources do you have?
**Bus Crash story
- USDOT records showed both shuttle company and the trucking company had
a history of safety issues (online database) with accidents and maintenance
