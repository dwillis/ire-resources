proprietary format like SPSS or SAS, we can convert that for you. Some PDF-to-spreadsheet
conversion also might apply here, provided that the data does not need a great amount of
cleaning to be useful.

Data visualization
You have your data but you don’t have a way to share it with the world. We can build easily
embeddable data visualizations using Tableau Desktop. Or, if you have a heavier lift, we can
explore building a custom data visualization that you can deploy on your website. If you need a
graphic package for print, we can do that, too. In these cases, we can visualize the data and
provide you with an EPS file that you can then edit to match your organization’s preferred style.
