Deadly Delays: Iowa
In start contrast with most of the nation, Iowa has
made vast improvements in is newborn screening
program over the past seven years.
In 2005, nearly 30% of babies’ blood samples in Iowa
took five or more days to reach the state lab. Most
hospitals sent samples through the U.S. mail, plus the
lab was closed on Saturday afternoons and Sundays.
Lab director Stanton Berberich didn’t like the risk.
Babies are born every day of the year, he said, and
each deserves the full benefit of newborn screening.

field of battle - victorious.’’
