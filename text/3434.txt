CORPORATE EXEC WHO HVE SOMETHING TO HIDE. PICKING AND
APPROACHING THOSE INVOLVED IN THE TRAGEDY OR CHAOS. STRATEGY
ON HOW TO GET AND DO THE IMPOSSIBLE INTERVIEW WITHOUT “BURNING
BRIDGES FOR YOURSELF OR YOUR NEWSROOM.
SNARING IN GENERAL:
- Approach anyone confidently - know the subject and as much as you can about the person you
are calling
- Be open, straight forward but authoritative and unafraid
- Get the person talking about anything to break the ice
- Try to find common ground on anything unrelated to the story
- Tap their curiosity - they want to know what you are working on and how they fit in
- Don’t argue - discuss
- Be courteous even to the evil doer
SNARING THE VICTIMS:
- It is okay to have sympathy for them - and to tell them that
- Take the time to make an honest and true connection
- Lower your voice
- Figure out why they may want to talk - what their motive may be - work that into your pitch
- Phone - email - then go see them in their own environment, a safe haven where they are
comfortable
- Find something in common - look at family pictures, the decor, the type of car they drive
- Listen without a camera or notebook - read their facial expressions- find out why they are
afraid
to do an interview - and then tell them why they should
- Tell them it’s okay to be nervous, or even scared.
- Tell them there is no obligation in talking to you - put in writing you won't use what they say
until they give the go ahead and don’t
- Explain your job, your role - tell them why the interview is important - why their voice counts
- Tell them while you won't show them the story, you will tell them what you are using and will
be glad to talk about why you used a specific quote
- Share with them a positive example from the past where someone spoke out and it led to a
positive result - - show them the story
- Tell the truth - don’t tell them if they talk, they won’t face repercussions
- Mark suggests telling them the “worst case” scenario can have a calming effect
- But, be sure to give the ‘best case’ scenario - that the injustice is finally corrected.

- Ask them to fast forward two years - where the status quo remains the same because they didn’t
speak out - ask how they will feel knowing they had a chance to end a bad situation but didn’t
- Make them understand how important they really may be
- If you sense real reluctance, assign them a small task to complete - get them to collect a few
documents for you. The “assignment” may set up a bond.
- Tell them doing the interview will be cathartic - it usually is
SNARING THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL:
- Remind him in writing he is paid by the taxpayers and it is his responsibility to answer
questions about how things work - that his party, leader, etc. has promised transparency and
accountability.
- Remind her “no comment” looks bad in print and sounds bad in broadcast
- Tell him you are doing the story whether he responds or not
- Go over what you need, listen to the comments and then ask “well why can’t you say that?”
- If he says he “can’t comment” on something specific ask what he can comment on
- Ask “if you don’t tell you the truth..then who will?”
- In the end, if she still says “no” ask who will say yes and start all over again
SNARING THE WHISTLEBLOWER:
- If someone won’t talk to you directly, find an intermediary they can talk to you through
- Ask someone to set up a dummy hotmail email account so you can ask questions
- When everyone else is clocking out, it’s time for you to clock in - Most really great ‘insiders’
can’t talk to you between 9 and 5 p.m..
- If someone’s job is really on the line get educated about whistleblower laws. In most states,
someone is NOT protected under Whistleblower legislation just because they speak to a
reporter
- Be sympathetic but don’t take sides
SNARING THE CORPORATE TYPE:
- Share with the subject of your investigation the facts UPFRONT - then, tell them you want
To hear their side of the story.
- Tell them you are doing the story with or without their interview
- Tell them you will ask questions the reader/viewer (who you represent) wants to know - you
will be touch but fair
- Tell them you must have an interview with someone at the company to be fair, you are going
over their head and will tell the boss what you know
- Don't ever give up - call, write, email, certified letter, etc.
- Time to do the ‘unscheduled interview’
- Follow up with a detailed “drop dead” letter. Detail the story and what you are going to say. In
a letter or email and ask for a sit down interview - set a hard deadline to do it.
- Ask them if they will read a statement they have written (last resort)

SNARING THE SCHEMER/SCAMMER:
- Appeal to their ego - most love the idea of being "important" or being able to brag about how
clever they are, love to promote themselves.
- Be slightly confused - ask the person to explain it all to you and then ask again as if you just
"don't get it"
SNARING THE PRISONER:
- If he or she says no get help from family members, prison ministers, hobby or teaching staffers,
clinic professionals attorneys
- Be non-threatening
- Go to see the prisoner and shake his/her hand
- The prisoner or someone on parole often can be convinced to do an interview because he/she
thinks it will impress a judge they are "on the mend"
SNARING THE CHILD:
- Take an interest in his/her toys - figure out what he/she likes
- Be prepared to spend some time "warming up"
- Sit down on the floor
HOW TO AVOID CUTTING YOURSELF OR YOUR NEWSROOM IN THE FUTURE
- Tell them you will ask tough questions - the ones your audience/reader wants to know but you
will be fair - make it a clean hit
- Talk to them after the interview about the questions you asked and why you asked them
