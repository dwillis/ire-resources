Handout –Latest Developments in FOIA and Open Records Law
Q. What happens when the response to your FOIA request is (1) We don’t have any such records, and/or
(2) Even if those records exist they don’t contain the information you’ve asked for.
A. Let the agency know that you will hold their feet to fire and possibly seek discovery into the agency’s
search for and contents of records sought. This may encourage a better, more thorough search. If a lawsuit
does get brought, consider seeking to oppose summary judgment under Fed. R. P. 56(f) (additional material
facts needed) and bring a motion for at least limited discovery under the authority described below (for
Plaintiff Requester).
Getting Discovery in a FOIA Action in Federal Court
Government position: The government sometimes makes overbroad assertions that discovery is not
available in FOIA actions. For example, a typical response is as follows:
The [Government] Defendants object to discovery. Discovery is disfavored in FOIA actions. See,
e.g., Heily v. United States Dep't of Commerce, 69 Fed. Appx. 171, 174 (4th Cir. 2003) (per
curiam) ("It is well-established that discovery may be greatly restricted in FOIA cases."); Wheeler
v. CIA, 271 F. Supp. 2d 132, 139 (D.D.C. 2003) ("Discovery is generally unavailable in FOIA
actions."); Hardy v. DOD, No. 99-523, slip op. at 7 (D. Ariz. Aug. 27, 2001) ("[D]iscovery is not
favored in FOIA cases."); Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Exp.-Imp. Bank, 108 F. Supp. 2d 19, 25 (D.D.C.
2000) ("[D]iscovery in a FOIA action is generally inappropriate."); Pub. Citizen Health Research
Group v. FDA, 997 F. Supp. 56, 72 (D.D.C. 1998) ("Discovery is to be sparingly granted in FOIA
actions."), aff'd in part, rev'd in part & remanded, 185 F.3d 898 (D.C. Cir. 1999); Katzman v.
Freeh, 926 F. Supp. 316, 319 (E.D.N.Y. 1996) ("[D]iscovery in a FOIA action is extremely
limited . . . .").
FOIA Requester’s position: Let the agency know that the law does allow discovery about the nature of
the search for requested documents and their contents, as follows:
Plaintiff Requester seeks fact discovery limited to the search for the requested records and their contents.
Discovery is appropriate “when an agency has not taken adequate steps to uncover responsive documents.”
Shrecker v. Department of Justice, 217 F. Supp. 2d 29, 35 (D.D.C. 2002) (citing SafeCard v. Securities and
Exchange Commission, 926 F.2d 1197, 1202 (D.C. Cir. 1991). If an agency does not carry its burden of
showing that it conducted a reasonable search, discovery may be allowed, see Campbell v. Department of
Justice, 193 F. Supp. 2d 29, 35-36 (D.D.C. 2001), so long as it is limited to the adequacy of the agency’s
search. Id. at 36 (allowing “limited discovery as to the location and contents of the disputed [FBI] tickler
files.”). “Conclusory statements that the agency has reviewed relevant files are insufficient to support
summary judgment [for the agency],” National Magazine, Washington Bureau v. Customs Service, 71 F.3d
885 (D.C. Cir. 1995), and if the agency does not carry its burden of showing that it conducted a reasonable
search regarding the location and contents of the requested records, discovery may be allowed. Campbell
v. Department of Justice, 193 F. Supp. 2d at 36.
