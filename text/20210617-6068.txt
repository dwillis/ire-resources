What is scraping?
It means to grab data
through code, elbow
grease, or whatever
method you have on hand.

5

Web scraping
Today we will extract data
from a single webpage.
This is different from
web crawling, document
scraping, and other kinds
of scraping.

6

HTML
We're going to scrape with HTML. This
is sometimes called source code.

This is how a website
looks to a human.

8

This is how it looks to a
computer.

9

Our goal is to land
somewhere in the
middle.

10

Sometimes source code
itself is interesting.
Jeb Bush's campaign
site included a detailed
summary of the movie
Die Hard.

11

HTML elements
HTML is broken into
elements. Elements are
wrapped in tags that look like
this:

There are a lot of tags, like
<h1> and <li> and <a>.
If you don't know what it
means, use an HTML
dictionary.

<>element</>

12

HTML elements
For example, tables:

Or headers:

<table>

<h1>

Here is my table,
between these table
tags.

Here is my header.
</h1>

</table>

13

Nested elements
Elements can be inside
other elements. That
means you can grab an
element and all the
elements inside it.

14

Nested elements
Table cell
1

Table row
A table row has the tag
<tr>, and contains table
cells inside it.

2

One cell in a table has
the tag <td>, which
stands for "table data."

Table
3

15

A table element
contains both table
rows and table cells. It
has the tag <table>.

Nested elements

You can grab a cell from a
table, a row, or a whole
table.

16

Technique 1
ImportHTML

importHTML
Type this formula in Google Sheets:
=ImportHTML(“url”, “element”)

The url is the link you are scraping.
The element is the HTML tag.

18

importHTML
For example:
=ImportHTML("https://ourworldindata.org/covidvaccinations","table")

This scrapes a table of Covid-19 vaccines available in
118 countries.
19

20

Hooray!
We scraped a live webpage.
But the ImportHTML formula is pretty limited.
Let's try something more advanced.

21

Technique 2
ImportXML

importXML
Type this formula in Google Sheets:
=ImportXML(“url”, “XPATH”)

The url is the link you are scraping.
The XPATH is the address of the data.

23

What is an XPATH?
An XPATH is like an address to a very
specific bit of data.

XPATH Examples
//table[@id='vaccines']/tr[3]/td[4]

//table[@id='vaccines']

// on this page

in the table called
'vaccines'

tr[3]/td[4]

in row 3

in cell 4

XPATH Examples

26

XPATH Examples

27

XPATH Examples
All bold text

//b

All headers (large text)

//h1

All headers containing the
word "country"

//h1[contains(.,'coun
try')]
//h1[@class='countryname']

All headers with the class
"country-name"

28

Having trouble finding
the XPATH?
You can also use the
Web Inspector to
cheat.

29

XPATH
Now that we know what
XPATH is (more or less),
let's use it to scrape
something a lot more
specific than tables.

30

importXML
For example:
=ImportXML("https://ourworldindata.org/covid-v
accinations","//table//tr/td/a/@href")

This scrapes all the links and their destinations in
that table of Covid-19 vaccines.
31

32

ImportHTML and ImportXML
That's just the basics. You can find plenty of in-depth
tutorials on ImportHTML, ImportXML, and other
formulas like ImportFEED.

33

Technique 3
Point-and-Click Apps

OutWit Hub
OutWit Hub is a desktop
app that can identify
each HTML element on a
webpage and scrape it.
The free version lets you
download 100 rows at a
time.

35

ParseHub
ParseHub is a desktop
app that can identify and
scrape elements and
sub-elements. The free
version lets you scrape
200 pages at a time.

36

WebScraper
WebScraper is a browser
extension that helps you
scrape stuff through the
Web Inspector. It only
sometimes works.

37

Disclaimer:
Free apps come and go.
They may not be up to date when you're reading
this. But that's why we learned the code instead.

38

And that's it!
Find me with questions.
I also recommend my newsletter Tools for
Reporters for cool stuff like this. Good luck!
