Getting the data
NICAR data library
Check the agency Website
Request from agency
Create data

Getting the data from an agency
Know the law
Do you homework
Know what the appropriate costs should be
Make your request clear
Get to know Leon
Follow up on your request

When there is no data
Use your sources
Sampling
Building data from documents
Physical surveys
Testing
Questionnaires, polls and surveys

Interview the data
Assume there are problems in the data

Interview the data
Assume there are problems in the data
How many records should you have? Are there
other counts to check: counties, states, etc…

Select state
Group by state
From SBA7A121

Interview the data
Assume there are problems in the data
How many records should you have? Are there
other counts to check: counties, states, etc…
Double-check totals or counts against summary
reports
Check for duplicates in multiple ways
Consistency-check all fields

Interview the data
Internal consistency checks

Interview the data
Internal consistency checks
Check the ranges of fields.
Check for missing data or blank fields. Are they
real values, or did something happen with an
import or append query?

Interview the data
Internal consistency checks

Check for missing data or blank fields. Are they
real values, or did something happen with an
import or append query?
Do you know what every field in the database
means? Are there special codes?

Interview the data
Internal consistency checks

Check for missing data or blank fields. Are they
real values, or did something happen with an
import or append query?
Do you know what every field in the database
means? Are there special codes?
Have there been changes over time that would
create problems?

The Methodology
Don’t recreate the wheel
Use the IRE resource center and your experts
Keep notes as you interview and analyze your
data
Use a standard naming convention for files and
tables (I wouldn’t recommend “final”)
Are there certain records that should be
excluded because of problems?

The Methodology
Borrow / steal from social scientists and other
analysts
Review what they’ve already done and then
interview them
Develop a hypothesis to test

The Methodology
Hone your analytical skills
Count, sort and filter for sure. Often, that’s all
that you need
Learn to aggregate by grouping or using pivot
tables if you using these techniques already
As you advance, build you skill with statistics

The analysis for story
So you’ve done all this, what are some
approaches to analyzing data for stories?
They come from the groundwork you’ve
already been laying
Think of the national, regional and local
levels of reporting and their different
requirements
So, some examples …

Resource Center example
IRE Resource Center story index
STORY NUMBER: 16986. In 2000, The
Kansas City Star found that the Small
Business Administration struggles to give
more government-guaranteed loans to
low-income neighborhoods and minorityowned businesses.

Approaches
Mashup data from other sources
Change over time

Analyze
Mashups: Use census data to create a
socio-economic portrait based on the
geography in your data
National: In which ZIP codes around the
country is this pattern still the case?
Regional: How do amounts and
successes of SBA loans compare in
different low income areas?

Analyze
Local: Where are the deepest pockets of
poverty in your city and how are SBA
loans working there?
Change over time: Is this just as true
today as it was in 2000? And at the
national, regional and local levels?

Government and academic examples
Government Accountability Office reports
and the Inspectors General investigations
Search engines such as Google Scholar
and Microsoft Academic Search

GAO example
In 2009, P.L. 111-5, the
American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act of 2009
(ARRA), provided
additional funding to
temporarily subsidize the
7(a) program’s fees and to
increase the program’s
maximum loan guaranty
percentage to 90%.

Approaches
Compared to what? Find or create a
measure that allows you to compare
relative success or failure
For example, has the “charged off” to
“paid in full” ratio increased since the
guarantee increased from 75 percent to
90 percent?

Analyze
Which banks have done the most lending
with increased guarantee compared to
the banks lending before?
Which banks are the “leaders” in charged
off loans?

Reality check example
What does on the ground reporting show
where the data and the SBA program are
failing?

Approaches
Data is a reduced view of the world
Leave the newsroom, and look at the
world in a lesser reduced version. In
other words, report

Analyze
Local: Find examples of businesses that
failed after receiving SBA loans
Compare what you’ve found about them
in the court house and through interviews
to what data – or lack of data – in the
database

Analyze
For example, in Champaign, IL, a
restaurant got one loan that was getting
paid back. Then it upped it with a
$550,000 SBA backed loan and went
belly up in a year. That was two years
ago. Still not in the SBA database.

From one of my smarty-pants colleagues:
One idea would be to see how many banks that have failed
(http://www.fdic.gov/bank/individual/failed/banklist.html) issued SBA
loans…
The FDIC is currently suing Innovative Bank, which failed on April 16,
2010. “In its lawsuit, the FDIC seeks to recover “not less than $7.1
million” the FDIC alleges the bank lost in connection with lending
activities on eleven commercial loans and forty-three Small Business
Administration loans. The complaint asserts claims for negligence,
gross negligence and breach of fiduciary duty against the individual
defendants, and also asserts fraud against one officer defendant, as
discussed below.”

Truck accidents by year and agency

Failed banks
No common ID between the databases
Small enough number to do locally/statewide
Verify that it is indeed the same bank
Because there is a lawsuit, you know a
relationship does exist

Closed banks in Texas

Loans made by potentially failed banks

Loans to lenders
In the real world, you would spend more time
with this…
34 banks with “loan” or “lending” in their names
in TX got SBA loans
20 of them are blank or were charged off

The Pitch
It’s all about timing, but a lot affects timing
For example, the editor or producers’
expectations
The level of understanding that your editor or
producer has for CAR
Anticipating what will come out of your editor
or producer’s mouth

Make sure
Your findings (including your math) are
solid
You have a simple and easy way to
explain your evidence
You have a minimum story
You have some idea of the time and
effort needed to go forward
You discuss priorities
You get a specific go/no go decision or at
least next steps

Beyond the data
How can you get real people into this story?
Why should the reader care?
What possible solutions are there?

The Pitch
Explain your findings in one or two sentences.
Provide an outline with a summary of your
findings
Provide a timeline/potential costs
