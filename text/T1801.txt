Sources and Interviews Tip Sheet (page two)
Seventeen records you should check before
writing about anyone
1. Real estate. What did they own and when did they own it?
2. Voter registration. Just in case the candidate came late to
participatory democracy.
3. Business records. Who are the partners?
4. Licensing records. Doctor, lawyer, cosmetologist …
5. Courts (lawsuits, liens). Unpaid bills, depositions, enemies.
6. Financial disclosure forms. Public officials disclose where the $
comes from.
7. IRS Form 990s (Guidestar) or SEC filings. Nonprofits sometimes keep
it for themselves; for-profits have to tell you quite a bit.
8. Any federal documentation. OSHA inspections, aircraft ownership,
pilot’s licenses, EEOC, etc.
9. Resumes. A good place to check, or I’m not the Harvard-educated
king of Mesopotamia.
10. FOIA and/or state public information act requests. Ask first, demand
if you must.
11. Board minutes. The discussions often reveal what’s behind decisions.
12. Zoning records. Clout is revealed at the zoning board. So are plans
for development.
13. Bonds and other financial documents. Under legal duress to disclose
thoroughly, your city, county, school district and state reveal much
that you want to know.
14. Journalism archives. Check first. Someone may already have done
that story, or missed that story.
15. Internet search. No human activity to strange to be recorded. Don’t
forget usenet groups, accessible from Google main page.
16. Campaign contributions. Follow the money.
17. Government contracts. Follow more of the money.
