Video and Audio are ‘Documents’ Too! Search for YouTube clips showing your subjects. 911 audio,
police body cam video, cell phone video of the subject’s complaints, surveillance video, home security
camera video. City/county hearings or meetings can “document reaction to your story.”
(SFPD Caught on Camera story)
Enlist Help: If you don’t have access to certain videos/documents, think about who DOES. Union
members. Social media. Businesses. Public defenders. (Body cam video)
Hold the Powerful Accountable with Paper: Bring important documents to interviews and be
prepared to quote from them if necessary. Use a one sheet to bullet point key numbers/facts if you’re
challenged. (Chancellor who used public $ to buy alcohol)
Social Media Footprints: Facebook, Twitter, Yelp, Tumblr can all give you valuable insight, quotes, or
help you find subjects to interview (We found parent who had horrible cord blood bank experience
with Yelp)
Favorite broadcast documents:
Emails
Search warrants
County and State Audits (usually online)
Lawsuits
Inspection reports
Complaints: everybody has complaints about something
License revocations
Voter records and police rosters are key to request now; save them.
Unclaimed money for your state (Every state is different but there’s $50 billion out there)
