Finding and Analyzing Data on FEC.gov
Christopher Schnaars, USA TODAY
cschnaars@usatoday.com, @chrisschnaars
The Federal Election Commission offers several flavors of campaign finance data. You can view an
individual report in PDF or HTML format, look at charts and maps summarizing campaign finance data or
search for specific contributions and expenditures. You also can download datasets ranging from the raw
text data for an individual report to a summary file containing all individual contributions made during the
two-year election cycle.

campaign finance reports with the FEC, which assigns each commiWWHHDÂ³&-QXPEHUÂ´ WKHOHWWHU&

corporation or union, or an independent expenditure only committee (sometimes referred to as a Super
PAC). Entities not required to file reports with the FEC that detail contributors Â± most notably 501(c)(3)

FEC website other than, perhaps, contributions from those nonprofits to committees that file reports.
Candidates for political office also receive an ID number from the FEC. These IDs are similar to
committee IDs but are prefixed with P, H or S (rather than C) depending on whether the person is a
candidate for president, the House or the Senate. The FEC assigns multiple IDs to candidates who run
for more than one office.

2) Weekly master files
If all you care about is contributionsDQG\RXGRQÂ¶WZDQWWRXVHGDWDIURPWKH6XQOLJKW)RXQGDWLRQ, the
fastest, easiest way to get the data you need is to download the weekly master contribution files compiled
by the FEC. You can find them at: http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/ftpdet.shtml
<RXÂ¶OOVHHWKHUHÂ¶VDOLQNIRUnine files per election cycle. Each of these summary files is useful, but the
three files ,Â¶P going to focus on now are highlighted below:

Links to data dictionaries are provided in the far-right column.

The indiv file supposedly contains all individual contributions of $200 or more to federal committees.
However, contributions that appear to be from corporations, PACs or other organizations sometimes are
included in campaign-finance reports on the line set aside for itemized individual contributions and
therefore show up in these master files. (You can use the Entity Type field to identify these.) Contribution
refunds, usually found on Schedule B, also are included.
Similarly, the pas2 file contains contributions to candidates from committees, and the oth file contains
contributions from one committee to another.

If you want to try using the update files, just keep in mind that if you ever fail to download and apply the

each week and does not maintain an archive. Additionally, if you fail to download and apply a weekly
XSGDWHDQGGRQÂ¶WUHDOL]HLWyour data will be corrupted, and you might not realize it.
Besides links to the files, the chart above contains the record count for each file, the date the file was last
updated Â± generally on Sunday afternoons Â± and links to data dictionaries, where you can get the data
type and a brief description of each field.
The rest of this guide largely focuses on how to download and analyze individual reports. But if you find
the weekly master files meet your needs, you most likely are better off using them rather than individual
filings. Before you go, though, lHWÂ¶VWDNHDTXLFNORRNDWWKHSURVDQGFRQVRIHDFK
3) Using the weekly master files vs. individual reports
Here are some reasons you might want to use the weekly master files discussed above rather than
download individual filings:
1. Senate data: Perhaps the most important reason to use the master files is they include
contributions to Senate candidates. While this is the 21 st century and virtually every Senate
candidate surely uses a computer to track contributions and generate these reports, senators still
allow themselves to file reports on paper, thereby obscuring the identities of their donors and
making that data a lot more difficult to work with. The FEC, in turn, spends taxpayer dollars to pay
contractors to input the once-computerized data from these paper reports. This makes the master
files the only source of electronic contribution data for senators and delays the availability of that
data. Note that depending on the volume of data that vendors need to input, Senate filings can
take weeks or even months to show up in the master files. PDF images of Senate reports can be
viewed on the FEC website, but it usually takes a week after the filing deadline for them to show
up. (A handful of senators opt to file their reports electronically. You can search for these
Â³XQRIILFLDOÂ´UHSRUWVKHUHhttp://docquery.fec.gov/senate/)
2. Transaction types: The FEC adds a Transaction Type code to each row. This field can be used to
characterize the type of contribution or disbursement on a much more granular level than just
using the line number field contained in the original filing. Presently, there are about 75 different
WUDQVDFWLRQW\SHVWKRXJK\RXÂ¶OOILQGIHZHUWKDQKDOIRIWKHPLQWKHPDVWHUILOHVThe data
dictionary for each master file lists the specific transaction types included in that file. A complete
list of transaction type codes can be found at:
http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/metadata/DataDictionaryTransactionTypeCodes.shtml
3. Fewer files: You need to download only three files to have all contributions of $200 or more for
the election cycle.
4. Refunds included: An important gotcha when you use the original filings is you have to be careful
to check Schedules A and B for contribution refunds. Refunded contributions are included in the
master files for you. To find refunds, look for Transaction Type 22Y.
5. No amended reports: If a report has been amended, only contributions from the most recent
reports are included in the master files. When you work with individual electronic filings, you
always have to check to see if a report has been amended.
6. FEC vetting: In addition to the transaction type codes, the FEC looks for missing or incorrect
candidate and committee IDs and adds this data to the master files.

Here are some advantages to using individual filings rather than the master files:
1. Timeliness: <RXFDQGRZQORDGWKHVHILOLQJVDVVRRQDVWKH\Â¶UHXSORDGHGWRWKH)(&ZHEVLWH
whereas the master files are generated only once a week (Sunday afternoons).
2. Address information: 7KHPDVWHUILOHVFRQWDLQDGRQRUÂ¶VFLW\DQGVWDWHEXWRPLWVWUHHWDGGUHVV
data found in the filings.
3. Names parsed: The individual filings include separate fields for first, middle and last names as
well as prefix and suffix and a completely separate field for organization names. In the master
files, names are concatenated into one field.
4. More forms and schedules: While most Schedule A data is included in the master files, some are
omitted. Some Schedule B data, most notably refunds and disbursements to other committees
(including amounts <$200), are included in the master files, but most is omitted, including
operating expenditures. Some data from Schedules E (independent expenditures) and F
(coordinated expenditures) also appear in the master files. All data found in another 12 schedules

most of this missing data anyway. Additionally, while this guide focuses on Form 3 and all related
VFKHGXOHVWKHUHDUHRWKHULQWHUHVWLQJIRUPV\RXZRQÂ¶WILQGLQWKHPDVWHUILOHVLQFOXGLQJcommittee
statements of organization (Form 1), 24- and 48-hour contribution and expenditure notices,
statements of candidacy (Form 2), lobbyist bundlers and the full text of miscellaneous
correspondence sent to the FEC (Form 99).
5. More contributions: ,Â¶OOGLVFXVVWKHWHFKQLFDOLWLHVRIZKHQDFRQWULEXWLRQKDVWREHLWHPL]HGODWHULQ
this guide, but the important distinction here is that itemized contributions found in electronic
filings are found in the master files only if they are for $200 or more.
6. More fields: The master files contain fewer fields than the individual filings. Whereas Schedule A
offers nearly 50 fields, for example, fewer than two dozen are included in the master files (though
other than street address and parsed names, all the important ones are there).
7. Smaller: If you only want specific reports or committees, you can download only what you need.
The master files include all contributions for the entire election cycle, so the files are very large.

likely the new report contains more than that: Look at the page counts for the original report and the
amended report. The amended report is nearly 70 percent longer.

As of February 2014, Obama for American amended the July 2013 quarterly report once after the FEC requested more information.

Amended reports are filed ALL THE TIME, and this often is done to correct mistakes or add additional
information without any prompting from the FEC. So if you write a story using numbers pulled from one of
WKHVHUHSRUWVLWÂ¶VDJRRGLGHDWRFheck the FEC website for amended reports before you publish.
5) How to read a report summary
Now click the PDF link for the amended report filed on 12/13/2013. Generally speaking, if you want to
look only at summary numbers atop a report, the HTML link is better. Whereas the PDF link will load the
entire report into your browser, the HTML version displays only the topline numbers for the report and
provides links to specific line numbers within the various Schedules. 1RWHWKDW2EDPDÂ¶VSRVW-general

You might think total receipts and total disbursements are interesting numbers, but they contain a lot of
extraneous stuff, such as candidate loans (for receipts) and contribution refunds (for disbursements). ,WÂ¶V
better to bypass these summary numbers and go a little deeper into the report.
The next gold nugget is Line 17, which is broken down into individual contributions (itemized and
unitemized), as well as contributions from political party committees (such as the DNC and the RNC),
other political committees (PACs) and the candidate. Line 18 shows transfers from other authorized
committees, which typically are joint fundraising committees (which I mentioned above).

Line 17 (or Line 11 for House, Senate and PACs) is where you can get details on individual and PAC contributions.

Notice that there are two columns of numbers. The first column shows amounts for the three-month
reporting period. The second column shows numbers to-date for the election cycle.
+HUHÂ¶VDQRWKHUSLWIDOOWREHDZDUHRIWhile candidate committeesÂ¶ election cycles are two years or more,
the clock resets for PACs and Super PACs Â± including the RNC and DNC Â± every January 1. This means
that if you want to look at how much money a PAC has received and spent during the 2014 election cycle,
you might want to look at the 3$&Â¶V\HDU-end report for 2013 as well as its most recent 2014 report.

for America, all of that money will be counted as unitemized contributions. But John really wants to give
all he can, so he digs into his couch cushions, finds $1 in change and mails it to Chicago. That $1 Â± and
only that $1 Â± must be itemized while the original $200 can remain unitemized. When you start looking at
the Schedule A records a little later in the guide\RXÂ¶OOVHHWKDWFRQWULEXWLRQUHcords include two dollar
figures: the amount of the specific contribution and the aggregate amount given during the election cycle.
In this example, those numbers would be $1 and $201. (Occasionally, committees voluntarily itemize
contribution aggregates of less than $200, but this is rare.)
Looking at the Line 17 numbers as a group can tell you a little DERXWDFDQGLGDWHÂ¶VILQDQFLDOVXSSRUW2QH

support. Comparing 17a1 with 17a2 can show you to what extent wealthier donors back the candidate.
Line 17d shows whether the candidate is fueling his or her own campaign. Line 17c shows how much
money the candidate got from special interests (PACs), though you should dive into the Schedule A data
and look at the details to be sure.

6) Dealing with multiple versions of the same form
As I mentioned above, presidential candidates, House and Senate candidates, PACs and lobbyists each
use a slightly different version of Form 3. For presidential candidates, contributions are on Line 17. House
and Senate candidates and PACs (forms F3 and F3X) use line 11.

7) How to inspect the detailed data in schedules A, B and so on
The text data for an individual filing can be confusing because that one file contains the summary
numbers and all schedules. Each schedule can have a different number of fields as well as its own
headers, none of which is in the file.

mistrustful of CSV files. Because commas occur so frequently in data, you often have to surround your

Using our template to filter for Schedule A records.

If you want to keep the file long term, you could take the time to split this sheet up into separate tabs (or
maybe just for Schedules A and B). To do that, turn off the Filter, highlight all your data and sort by

Column A to get your header row and all your data into one contiguous block. Then just copy and paste to
a new tab.
Now that all your data is in one place, you can more easily examine it: Who are the big donors? Where
are those donors from? (Are they out-of-state?) Are certain employers or industries providing a
disproportionate amount of support? What PACs are giving to this group and vice versa? How much are
they spending on their payroll? What other expenses do they have? Now that the data is in Excel, you
can sort and filter to answer some of these questions and discover new questions.
If you like the template, you can create additional templates for older header versions (8.0 and so on), but
you might not need them unless you want to go back and look at older reports. No reports filed after midJanuary 2014 should use older headers, Schedule D is the only part of Form 3 that has changed since
8.0, and 8.0 has been in use since September 2011.

means this row is not included in the topline number referred to in the first column because the amount
already is counted somewhere else.
This happens a lot with joint fundraising committees and other groups, such as ActBlue, that collect
money from a bunch of donors, then write one big check to a campaign. In cases like this, the grand total
is counted in the topline numbers (meaning the MEMO CODE field is blank). The excluded rows that
identify the individual donors satisfy the disclosure requirements, and excluding those rows is a way to
make sure no money is double-counted. However, if your goal is to identify individual donors and you

refunds. Refunds generally should be in Schedule B, but sometimes they show up as negative amounts
in Schedule A. Keep in mind that weeks or months might pass between the contribution and the refund,
so the two transactions might not be on the same report.
A good rule of thumb is to do name searches on Schedules A and B to look for all contributions and
refunds. You also can check TEXT records to see if there are references to refunds (though these should
be in addition to, rather than in lieu of, Schedule A or B records showing the refund). Also pay attention to
the aggregate of the most recent contribution to make sure everything adds up.

If access to hardware is the only issue, you could scale back the volume of data by just building a system

could delete amended data. You might even limit your database to specific committees, schedules and/or
fields. If you do all these steps, you might even be able to get by with SQLite or Microsoft Access. An
older version of my FEC database (https://github.com/cschnaars/FEC-Scraper) downloads reports only
for the committees you specify.
But automation is the key here, and that means working knowledge of a scripting language such as

12) In conclusion
My goal with this tutorial has been to shed some like upon the murky nature of campaign finance data
and help journalists competently and confidently work with it. The toll the economy has taken on
newsrooms throughout the country for much of the past decade has, I believe, resulted in fewer reporters
to keep an eye on money in politics. Given the vehicles that allow donors to pump unlimited millions of
dollars into an election Â± largely through 527s, Super PACs and 501(c) nonprofits Â± helping to make this
data more accessible to other reporters is critical. We still compete for stories, but I think collaborating to
help everyone obtain clean, workable data is in the best interest of readers everywhere.
When I first took an interest in campaign finance, some very smart reporters at various news
organizations helped me get started and have been an ongoing resource over the years. Without their
help, I never would have gotten to the point where I could write the gXLGH\RXKDYHQRZ,Â¶GOLNHWRWKDQN
