2. On the “MONEY TRAIL” at the 2008 Conventions:
-

Goal: to show politicians, lobbyists, and fundraisers together in an exclusive “pay to
play” atmosphere
Able to film in public places and private events with cameras in the open
Ross Team had multiple cameras on us at all times, exploring public and private venues
NO HIDDEN CAMERAS, no trespassing, obtained invites to every private event
Beware of overzealous cops, but know your rights in public and private settings

3. Rights, Privileges, Practices on shooting Public vs. Private places:
WE CAN GO WHERE THE PUBLIC CAN GO…but cannot obstruct public
- Do not misrepresent:
PUBLIC SHOOTS:
- CONFRONTATIONS
Stay polite but firm, roll on everything
“My 1st Amendment right”
“These sidewalks are paid for by public, municipal funds”
o With Police:
 “Where can I stand?”
o With Restaurant staffs/bouncers:
 Rarely ever know our public/journalist privilege (i.e. shooting from
sidewalk)…stay firm and ask what they are hiding.
 OR make friends with the camera off and trade intel for moving locations
PRIVATE LOCATIONS:
- Private restaurant CAN discriminate against us because you are a journalist. Once
you are told you can’t come in you can’t sneak in.
- TRESPASSING:
- Driveway IS an okay space. Implied license for people to come in. Cannot go into gated
communities or drives.
- Ride alongs and permission – you cannot go into homes/premises unless you have
the homeowners permission. Not just cop’s permission. But driveway is okay.
