The Metal Men: Lessons for Writers
• There is no substitute for witnessing the action
• Tell the story in scenes
• Each scene must accomplish a specific goal

• The link between detailed reporting and powerful writing is

inextricable

Storytelling Questions
• Who is driving the action in this story?
• What does that character have at stake?
• Whose lives will be affected by action the character

takes?
• What is the story about – beyond the set of facts
involved?

The Editor’s Role
• Create an environment where great work is possible
• Follow the story wherever it leads
• Understand that all good editing happens before anything

is written
• Attend personally to every detail of the craft
