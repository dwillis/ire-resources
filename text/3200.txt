The Chronicle of Higher Education’s online databases
about academe

I want to take you on a tour of some data on The Chronicle of
Higher Education’s website that reporters might find useful in
covering their local universities. These data are not available in
one place anywhere else, or some of the sources charge a hefty
fee.
Because The Chronicle is a niche publication with a loyal
readership, our content is behind a pay wall. (Imagine that,
people actually pay us to read our copy!) However, I can provide
reporters free access to our website upon request; contact me at
the e-mail address above. Our main data page, Special Issues and
Data, is at http://chronicle.com/special/ . An archive is at
http://chronicle.com/stats/archive/archive.htm . We’re redesigning
our website; look for the ‘Facts and Figures’ tab on the new home
page, http://chronicle.com .
Many major debates today in higher education revolve around data
and the lack thereof. These include the high cost of college
tuition and the low quality of college undergraduate education in
America. The Chronicle’s web site has a wealth of data and survey
results about administrators, faculty, students, and institutional
finances. We have built or obtained several databases searchable
by individual college or university. Here are some:
- Compensation of college presidents. Pay and benefits for
colleges’ chief executives have steadily grown, triggering outside
scrutiny because of the recession and spiraling tuition. The
Chronicle annually compiles a searchable database of presidential
compensation. The data come from the IRS tax filings known as Form
990’s, which contain much useful information about tax-exempt
charities, including private, nonprofit colleges. The Chronicle
collects 990s from hundreds of those colleges and conducts its own
survey of an additional 184 public universities and 64 community
colleges. We highlight the top moneymakers, for example, the
president of little-known Suffolk University in Boston, who led
all college CEOs in 2006-7 with total compensation of $2.8million.

- Compensation of other employees. College presidents draw most of
the heat for high pay on college campuses, but another recent
story using the same 990 data found that the CEO’s actually
represent a minority of the 300 highest-paid employees in academe.
Medical-school physicians and athletic coaches predominate. These
data are not on our web site because we are selling them as
premium content, but we will give the data to reporters for free.
(For The Chronicle’s article based on these data, see ‘Who’s
Making The Most,’ http://chronicle.com/special/ )
- What professors make. You can compare pay for presidents against
that for faculty members at colleges in your area. The gap is big
and growing as some presidents’ pay soars and faculty pay is
mostly flat. We have a searchable database of faculty pay by
institution and academic rank (i.e. full professor, associate
professor, etc.), compiled by the American Association of
University Professors, at http://chronicle.com/stats/aaup .
- Academe’s pork barrel. Congressional earmarks have become a
notorious symbol of wasteful spending and questionable ethics by
Congress. The Chronicle’s website offers 15 years of annual data
(through FY2008) about billions of dollars handed out by lawmakers
to colleges in their home districts for pet projects (see a
searchable database and related stories at
http://chronicle.com/stats/pork ) The available evidence
contradicts the main argument offered in favor of earmarks -offered, not coincidentally, by those who receive, award, and
lobby for them -- that these noncompetitive set-asides for
scientific research help colleges build research programs that can
compete successfully for money handed out by federal agencies the
normal way, that is, open, merit-based competitions.
You can find earmarks on your own by searching the 2009
appropriations bills for colleges in your area. Beware, however,
that millions of dollars in additional earmarks for your state’s
research institutions may be hidden in the Defense spending bill,
despite Congress’s boasting that it has made earmarking
transparent. You can use press releases from your Congressional
delegation to track down the intended recipients of some of these
mystery earmarks, whom legislators are not required to identify in
the bill. Or ask your legislators -- the spending bills must list
each earmark’s sponsor -- who they intended to receive the money.
Also keep in mind that Congressional spending bills frequently

name as intended recipients mysterious “centers” and “institutes”
that are, upon closer inspection, part of universities.
Finally, check out whether your local colleges are among the
growing number that have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
annually on Washington lobbying. Most colleges that lobby do so
predominantly to receive Congressional earmarks. The Chronicle
reported that colleges and universities spent $62-million in 2003,
double the amount spent just five years earlier, making academe
one of the biggest clients of lobbyists in Washington, on par with
defense contractors. (For recent data, search Congress’s Lobbying
Disclosure Act Database at

- Enrolling needy students: how the wealthiest colleges rate. This
2006 story examined the prevalence of Pell Grants, which go to the
poorest students, at colleges with endowments over $500-million.
The story’s lead read: "Elite colleges have made headlines in
recent years with financial-aid plans aimed at enrolling more lowincome students. But despite those efforts, the proportion of
financially needy undergraduates at the nation's wealthiest
colleges and universities actually dropped between the 2004-5 and
2006-7 academic years, according to a Chronicle analysis of
federal Pell Grant data." The data, covering 114 colleges, are at
http://chronicle.com/weekly/v54/i34/5434pell_table.htm Perhaps
some of these are in your coverage area.
- Fund-raising by colleges to support athletics. The Chronicle
carried out the first detailed survey of this practice, obtaining
answers from 64 institutions. We found that the amount of all
college donations that were for athletics grew from about 15
percent in 1998 to 25 percent in 2003, a period when over-all
donations were flat. This meant that the athletic donations were
taking away from giving for other, non-athletic purposes at
universities. The biggest spenders in athletics -- $2,000 a year
in some programs -- did so to get tickets for good seats at
football games. The amount of endowment per athlete often exceeded
that for students institution-wide.

- Spending by colleges to recruit athletes. Nearly half of the
nation's largest athletics programs have doubled or tripled their
recruitment spending over the past decade, as their pursuit of
elite athletes intensified and became more national in scope, The
Chronicle found. In 2007, the top spenders ponied up almost $1million per institution. The Chronicle’s searchable database
(http://chronicle.com/weekly/v54/i47/47a00102.htm#spenders ) of

1,000 colleges includes the number of teams, number of
participating students, scholarships, and expenses for operations,
coaching and recruiting.
- Where students using the GI bill go to study. A majority of
veterans and current service members attend community colleges and
proprietary colleges, citing the low cost and the convenience of
online courses, The Chronicle found. Only 6 percent of all college
students choose for-profit institutions compared with 19 percent
of GI-bill students. That matters because many graduates of those
institutions earn only a certificate or an associate’s degree,
which doesn’t bring a salary as high as a bachelor’s degree does.
Our story (http://chronicle.com/weekly/v54/i46/46a00101.htm )
includes a list of the top 25 institutions with the largest GIbill enrollments.

Association of University Professors over academic freedom and
tenure (http://chronicle.com/indepth/labor/censure.htm )
- A few institutions have narrowed gaps in graduation rates
between black and white students
(http://chronicle.com/weekly/v54/i34/34a02001.htm#success ), but
most black students attend colleges with low graduation rates for
black students

Higher Education awarded letter grades to the states based on how
well they deliver higher education (and the results weren’t
flattering.) (http://chronicle.com/weekly/v55/i16/16a01401.htm )
- We have databases that are searchable by individual colleges and
universities for information about tuition, endowments, and the
race and ethnicity of students and of faculty.
A few words about U.S. Department of Education data on colleges.
The agency’s database, the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data

System (http://nces.ed.gov/ipedspas/) – which is not part of The
Chronicle’s web site -- contains extensive data about colleges’
finances, student aid, enrollments, and employees. The Chronicle
used this database to show that colleges’ spending on instruction
was increasing by more at the wealthiest institutions than at the
least wealthy, measured by endowment per FTE student
(http://chronicle.com/weekly/v52/i31/31a00101.htm .)
You could examine IPEDS’ data about your local colleges’
graduation rates. This rate is the percentage of entering freshmen
who earn a bachelor’s degree within six years. This could be an
important accountability measure -– but bear in mind the
limitations of these data. IPEDS only counts full-time, first-time
students, although part-time students increasingly attend many
colleges. Also, graduation rates don’t account for students who
transfer to another institution, where they may complete a degree;
IPEDS regards them as non-completers at the first college. In
general, IPEDS is not user friendly, and its data are often at
least two years out of date and are self-reported by colleges.
