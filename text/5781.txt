Payroll records as tools to find potential sources of current/former campaign
staffers.
More payroll data usage: Map out a member’s trusted circle of staffers. Who do
members of Congress have on their leadership PAC and on the campaign? Do
any of them move to super PACs that support their campaign? Are they
employing family members?
Consulting and fundraising services. Who are the most influential consultants in
your state and how much business are they getting from the election? Plus digital
services (lucrative, especially with small dollar $)
Think creatively about data pairings. Example: At the end of 2018 midterms I
wanted to know whether small dollar donations to House Dems helped expand
the map. To do this, I matched up quarterly unitemized donations with
contemporaneous Cook Political Report toss-up/lean list, which served as a key
data point for my ​story​.
Historical context​ for campaign expenditures

NIM​P
○ Since NIMP has great state level data, use it to see donors’ influence that spans
beyond their home state. Example: I worked closely with NIMP to map out
Richard Uihlein’s ​growing influence​ in the Midwest and beyond.
○ Consult NIMP first before using the database on your own
IRS​ 527 search (and ​data​)
○ The use of 527’s as ​legal defense funds ​(Trump, Menendez, Clintons)

agencies and cabinet secretaries

Lobbyist contributions

lawmakers mingling; ties between lawmakers, nonprofits and lobbyists

FCC ad data​ (and FCC.gov for ​ads​)
○ Reporters should be looking out for increased state-level advertising/IE activity by
Americans for Prosperity during the 2019-2020 cycle, because they’re moving
away from federal politics and are expected to divert more spending to state-level
work, supporting campaigns and ballot measures.
