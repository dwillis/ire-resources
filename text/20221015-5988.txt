Holding companies
accountable

Is this even a story?
How to decide when a company’s alleged bad behavior is worth an
investigation …
●

It’s very difficult to find a story that has never been done in some way.

●

Do some pre-reporting to find the maximum & minimum story.

●

Example: The story of child labor in the cocoa industry had been told. But not the
story of the industry’s broken promises to stop it.

Is this even a story?
Can you show actual harm and not just potential for harm related to a company’s behavior or
actions?
●

How many people are harmed?

●

Who are they? Wealthy shareholders, employees or unsuspecting members of the public?

●

In what way are they harmed?

●

How can you show this harm?

●

Example: Our investigation of Fisher-Price’s Rock n’ Play sleeper.

Is this even a story?
Can you hold specific companies and people within those companies accountable?
●

Don’t just write about “industry” doing something.

●

Which officials within the company made the decisions?

●

Does the company have a board? If so, who is on it and what else do they do?

●

You have to really try to reach these key decision makers.

Is this even a story?
Who is supposed to stop or fix this behavior?
●

Can you hold regulators accountable for failure to oversee this company?

●

Potential federal regulators: the SEC, OSHA, federal courts, possibly
Congress.

●

Depending on the type of company, also EPA, SBA, CDC, HHS, DOD, USDA
and other industry-specific federal agencies.

Is this even a story?
●

Potential state regulators: state labor departments, secretaries of state, state
taxing entities, state lawmakers and state courts all may exercise jurisdiction over
companies.

●

File FOIAs for communications among federal and state regulatory officials
mentioning the company. In your request, list key words, date parameters, domain
names and specific individuals’ names.

●

If the potential story is being pushed by an individual or group of people, have they
taken all of the steps that they can take before coming to you? Have they filed
complaints or lawsuits? What was the outcome?

Is this even a story?
Can your story create impact?
●
●
●
●

Not every investigation results in the problem being fixed but is there potential for
impact including legislation, investigations, audits etc.?
Consider interviewing those watchdogs during your investigation so they are
aware of the issue and more likely to follow up with impact.
Write about the impact! More than ever, readers need to know about how
investigative journalism can make their lives better.
Example: Todd Frankel’s investigation of the Consumer Product Safety
Commission led to the acting director’s resignation.

Where to get story ideas ...
●

The watchdogs

●

Current and recent former insiders: Use LinkedIn Advance, Contct Out and
other people-finding tools to track down top decision makers and those right
below them who may be willing to talk and/or supply documents.

●

Lawsuits: Even if they’re unrelated to the story you’re working on, the top
officials may have been deposed at some point and those depositions usually
are far wider than the issue that the lawsuit is focused on.

Where to get story ideas …
●

FOIA is also for stories you don’t know about

●

Trackers and alerts including trackly, Sqoop, (free) Factiva and Dataminr
(costs $$)

●

Sign up for industry newsletters and webinars if they’re open.

●

Search YouTube, Vimeo and other video services for videos that company
executives may have posted.
