Before news happens
• What likely is to happen in your market or on your beat?
• Adapt threat modeling to breaking news
o What are the high-profile institutions and who are the highprofile people?
o What events could happen based on climate and geography?
o What events could happen based on infrastructure and
population?
What to prepare ahead of time?
• What information might you want at your fingertips?
• Sources. Who should you know and develop rapport with?
• Given your role, what are your first reads of a situation?
• What roles need to be filled first to get a handle on the news?
o Understanding what the situation looks like and what resources
you will need
o Shot caller or someone to maintain a 10,000 foot view of things.
• How to anticipate/prepare so you can deploy staff quickly
In the moment
• Best practices for mining social media and verifying what you find
• What story forms and strategies work best on developing or breaking
stories?
• How will we share information with the newsroom?
• Transparency with the audience - why we’re reporting a fact and what
we don’t know
• How to boost your coverage in search and social
The second day
• Keeping the team fresh and rested
• Tracking threads and follow-ups
• How does the newsroom remain agile after the plan is in place?

How do we move from what is happening to a why it matters
approach?
Catering to what an audience wants to know

What we don’t know after the obvious nuts and bolts
• What data might be available?
• How easily is it accessed?
• Is it in a form I can understand and analyze?
• How fast can I understand and analyze it?
• What value could it provide to our coverage?
• Where do I go?
• Find relationships; put event into context.
• Be prepared—know what you should have before news breaks
3 levels
• What can you find online—immediately
• What can you get from public documents—where do you need to go
get it
• Is there a bigger story we need to look into long term (ask if there is
more to the story)
Keep it organized!

Precipitation data
• 5-day precipitation forecast shapefiles (you want the last .tar file
which looks something like QPF120hr_day1-5_latest.tar):
ftp://ftp.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/shapefiles/qpf/5day/
• Observed precipitation data (you want it as geotiff with the date and
range selected. Getting it to work in QGIS takes a little more work,
but they have a guide if you scroll down on how to do it):
https://water.weather.gov/precip/download.php
• Storm predictions: http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/online/
• FEMA ArcGIS server: https://gis.fema.gov/arcgis/rest/services
City and School Employee Databases
• Get list from each jurisdictions in your area
• Ask for first/middle/last names, salaries, date of hire
• Ask for department, position, age, home address, and gender
• Get data in spreadsheet form
• This can help you confirm details about an employee when news
breaks (or in general backgrounding) when many times PIOs refuse
to confirm a person's employment
• Have to get this ahead of time, but a great tool to have at
your disposal for breaking news and long term projects.
• Geofeedia.com
• Great new website that helps you locate pictures, video, and
other types of media around a particular location
• You pick the location, then posts will appear and you can
individually view them. Makes it easy to find pics & video of a scene,
plus contact witnesses
• This site is new, but free to journalists. They should be
able to verify your credentials within a day, but better to sign up
before you need it
Images.Google.com
• Not only can you use Google to look for images once you've
started a regular Google search, you can also do a reverse image
search

• When on the Google image website, just click on the camera
icon & upload your own pic. Then Google will scan the web for other
sites that the image appears on
• This can help you confirm a person's identity, see if their
Facebook pic appears on other websites, or find out if a picture is
fake or ripped off of another website
OpenStatusSearch.com
• Who needs to be Facebook friends when you have this website?
• When breaking news happens, use OpenStatusSearch.com to see
what people are saying about an incident, person, or subject matter
• Can be used to find victims, witnesses, neighbors, etc. Just click the
person's name and send them a Facebook message or use your
favorite phone number finder to locate their info
People Finders
• Spokeo
• ZabaSearch
• SkipEase

• Facebook graph search: http://www.graph.tips/
• Facebook advanced search: https://searchisback.com/
• YouTube search by location: http://www.geosearchtool.com/
• Social search by username: http://knowem.com/
• When searching twitter, cut through the clutter by using key words in
your search like “I” “we” “our”, cuts out the news tweets and retweets)
Private Companies
• If it's a private company, check review websites
• BBB (what's the rating like, have there been recent complaints, will
the BBB connect you with consumers?)
• Your state's Attorney General and Secretary of State
• Yelp, CitySearch, Yahoo
Web Archive (formerly Wayback Machine)

• Sometimes right after a breaking news event a company or person
will pull down its website. Use a search engine's "Cache" function to
pull up old versions of the page
• Check out http://archive.org/index.php for what used to be called the
Wayback Machine to also get access to archived webpages
• This is also helpful to check for longer term investigations if you're
trying to see what a company used to advertise, get old phone
numbers, etc.
