I AM

MILITARY (AND SO CAN YOU!)

BEFORE I EVER BECAME A
REPORTER, I WAS A MARINE GRUNT

AND LATER I BECAME A WAR
CORRESPONDENT

Stringing to cover the wars in Sierra Leone, Guinea and other fun places
(don’t do this)

THEN I TRIED TO GO LEGIT …

I became a reporter. And then an investigative reporter !

I COVERED THE WAR IN IRAQ …

AND THEN AN ARMY RECRUITER ASKED ME
TO FIGHT IN IT! AS A GRUNT! MY ASS GOT
BLOWN UP FOUR TIMES. AND THEN
STOPLOSSED!

SO I’M INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED
WITH THE MILITARY

As a Marine, a soldier and a reporter who investigated the armed forces, the
Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Homeland Security
