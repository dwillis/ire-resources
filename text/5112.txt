A word from the OSU legal dept…
• The views on this important issue are those of Dr. Halihan, not
Oklahoma State University or its school of geology

• Through in-depth research, Dr. Halihan provides vital scientific
data that is helping with the study of seismic activity in our region

• We would hope this research will further the study and
conversation, informing key players and decision-makers

• As a land-grant university, Oklahoma State University has an
obligation to conduct research and share that research with
society

• We welcome your thoughts and views on this issue

What to look for in Science Referees?
1. Is there an available known neutral scientific communicator?
No Dr. Oz for rocks.
2. Is there an agency that plays referee?
No “Energy NTSB”. No neutral ref.
3. “Public opposition can be seen as a breakdown of trust…trust
is quickly lost and slowly regained…not resolvable by public
relation campaigns” (Slovic et al, 1991)

1. Oklahoma: largest changes in seismicity in history
2. Oklahoma:
managing one of
the world’s largest

3. COMMUNICATION

The Rules (7 currently)
Need framework to convey science (best data and
uncertainty) to general public
Needs to work with range of citizens, backgrounds, and
time periods for dispersing information

Need rules that a scientist could
follow to be effective, similar to
medical professionals talking to a
dying patient or police officers
talking to suspect
1.

3. COMMUNICATION

1. Let Scientist Play Ref
Neutral Party
Welcome feedback on things that don’t seem neutral
Providing options, not pros/cons

1.

3. COMMUNICATION

2. Find 2 kinds of expert, not 4
1. Science Expert (academic training, publishing)
2. Daubert Standard Expert (qualify as legal expert)

3. Wrote all the papers – “his wacky theories; friends
reviewed”
4. Gets all the funding – “funding your research”
1.

3. COMMUNICATION

3. Don’t make them
leave the mountain
Can’t go tell people facts, they need to ask
Pushing material puts you on one of the teams

1.

3. COMMUNICATION

4. Peer reviewed material only
Don’t simplify by making own graphics, improve
existing if terrible
Reference every slide
Provide list of references

1.

3. COMMUNICATION

5. You can’t twitter knowledge
Science doesn’t go fast
Twitter is for conversing, not informing
It’s call “social media”, not “science media”

You can give a talk
to 50,000+ people

3. COMMUNICATION

6. Biology/Dress Counts
People trust
1. Taller
2. Deeper voice
3. Left Handed
4. Short names

3. COMMUNICATION

7. Communicating faith,
not evidence

Future of Refereeing...
Paid referees?
Establish protocols for neutral science experts
