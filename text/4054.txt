“Go ahead,
make my data”

Data critical to …
• WaPo gun-related investigations:
• Mined databases of crime guns seized by local
cops to reveal patterns behind the recoveries.
• Conducted our own gun traces: Mashed up gun
recovery datasets with database of guns sold to
reveal top sources of crime guns in region.
• Analyzed gunfire: Scrubbed a database of
gunshots logged by an acoustic detection
system to reveal prevalence of gunfire.

Reporting on guns = unique challenges
• Hard to break revelatory stories that go beyond hesaid, she-said rhetoric.
• Politics of guns can’t be ignored. Impacts
willingness of people to comply, for example,
with data requests.
• Devil in details: critical nuances, ranging from
technical to legal. Journos pay high price in
credibility for small errors w/ guns, in my opinion.
• And, investigative gun coverage is complicated by
Congressionally-imposed secrecy.

Understanding the Secrecy ….
•
•

•

•

A direct result of gun politics -- specifically the backlash to publicity about
ATF gun tracing and the retail sources of crime guns.
Each gun leaves a paper trail through its serial number, from manufacturer
to first retail sale. Gun tracing identifies where a gun was first sold into
retail market, when it was sold and to whom it was sold.
Huge investigative tool for law enforcement that can surface unseen gun
trafficking patterns. Good, bad or indifferent, tracing can tie dealers to
crime scenes.
ATFs research in the late 1990s revealed that about 1.2 percent of the then
80,000+ dealers in the nation sold nearly 60 percent of the crime guns.
Significant policy and enforcement ramifications.
Trace data was then-subject to FOIA. Journos, advocacy groups,
politicians mined the data to write about – sometimes absent critical
context -- the dealers behind the greatest number of crime guns.
The firearms industry was upset, felt unfairly demonized. Congress
listened and soon forbid the ATF from disclosing trace information , also
closing the door on a a wide swath of other firearms-enforcement records.

ATF
Gun Trace
•

•

This is the paper
version of ATF
trace. This gun used
in a restaurant
robbery in
Portsmouth. It lists
shop that sold the
gun, when it sold it,
and to whom it was
sold.
In this case, the
robber bought the
gun; usually crime
guns have changed
hands since initial
sale.

A few strategies …
• … to pierce the secrecy, investigate and
write about the illegal use of guns with
authority.

1 > Get local gun recovery data
• Virtually all police agencies recover guns.
• Guns found next to bodies, in waistbands, or dumped in
storm drains. These guns get bagged and tagged and
eventually sent to a firearms examination unit and/or
property room. They are likely logged into a database or
spreadsheet along the way.
• Depending on your local open records laws, these logs or
datasets may be subject to open-records act requests. Be
prepared: May encounter resistance, cops may argue they
need to redact guns still part of live investigations.
• But worth it: Data can be a wealth of information.

Data logged on each gun may include:
– Date/time of recovery
– Address of confiscation
– Serial number
– Manufacturer and model
– Caliber and type of gun (handgun, shotgun, rifle, etc.)
– Police beat or district
– Police unit (street crimes, etc.) or officer making recovery
– Crime category of circumstances (found gun, homicide, etc.)
– Incident number (key: ties gun to crime incident reports and/or
case files that can possibly be requested or retrieved in court)
– Also may list:
• Gun reported stolen (NCIC)
• Supplemental material (spent slugs, shells, etc)
• Other markings (notches on barrel, name “Dave’s enforcer”
engraved on grip, gold inlay, etc)

Firearms Examination Unit log example:

Documented: about 50,000 guns seized
• Since 2000 in The District and Prince George’s;
roughly one gun every 2-3 hours.
• Gun logs, at the most basic, will reveal the sheer
volume of recoveries in a local jurisdiction or
region. Likely way more than most people realize.
• And, it’s a way to report on illegal gun activity
that goes beyond the usual crime stat categories
publicized by the police and FBI.
– Many agencies don’t publicize gun recoveries.

Other analysis ...
• Plot locations and circumstances of recoveries
• Analyze recovery patterns
– Clusters by geography
– Clusters by dates
– Clusters by officers or units
– Clusters by type (handgun vs. rifle, etc.)
– Clusters by crime types
• Find guns recovered more than once
• Surface compelling cases.
• And reporting on guns tied to multiple crimes.

“Sea of Steel” …
• Detailed what we found regarding crime guns, published in May 2013
• A drill down on the steady drip-drip-drip of guns recovered by cops in
PG and DC in matters mundane and murderous.
– Co-reported by Andras Petho, Investigative Fellow from Hungary.
• Large interactive component; could click on a street corner and get
summary of guns recovered at that location and the associated
circumstances, etc.

2 > Run your own traces
• Where are these crime guns first sold?
• Some states regulate gun sales in addition to, and
independent of, the feds.
• Maryland is one of those states. Sales of all handguns and
some other firearms are regulated by the Maryland State
Police.
• And, as you might guess, these sales are all tracked and
recorded in a database.
• I filed a public records request and after some back and
forth, received a DVD w/ hundreds of thousands of guns
sold in Maryland since 1990 or so.

Included these fields:
• Serial number
• Type
• Maker, i.e. “Glock”
• Model, i.e. “19”
• Caliber i.e. “9 mm”
• Dealer ID number
• Date of purchase

With the sales data from Maryland …
• Could pinpoint when and where a gun entered the retail
market in Maryland.
• The gun recovery logs gave me lists of guns cops
recovered by police in PG and DC.
• The datasets both dated to the early ’90s, and had common
fields: SN, caliber, maker.
• Joined the two disparate datasets: surfaced the crime guns
seized that were first sold in Maryland.
• Knew when and where they were first sold.
• This is, effectively, the same information ATF is
prohibited from disclosing – the trace.

The crunching required ….
• Parsing, and cleaning the evidence gun recovery logs from
the police departments.
– Expect gun logs to be dirty - serial numbers entered
with hyphens and spaces, “5s” become “Ss”, model
names all over map.
• I used SQL via Visual Fox, but the data work could be
done in Access or your database manager of choice. No
proprietary stuff.
• I exported cuts of data back into Excel for quick
manipulation, additional roll-ups and analysis and for
export to designers and graphics folks.
• Labor intensive, but simple conceptually.

In end, traced 9,000+ crime guns ...
• To Maryland dealers. This is after inspecting matches and
discarding vague or bad matches.
• Knew when and where each gun was sold, where and
when it was recovered and what the alleged crime
involved.
• Keep in mind: Not all guns recovered (not all guns sold in
Maryland), but a best-available window given the federal
secrecy on gun tracing.
• Also could evaluate “time to crime,” which is a key ATF
metric for firearms trafficking.
– Most guns NEVER recovered by cops (300 million+ in circulation)
and those that are on streets for a dozen years. Those seized with a
year or two from sale likely were intentionally trafficked at or
shortly after initial retail sale, per ATF guidelines and research.

2,500 guns, 1 dealer

The No. 1 MD source from our
analysis: gun store in an old house
just outside the Beltway in PG.
about 2,500 guns traced in all.
The next biggest, active dealer had
600.
Adjusted by sales volume:
• Realco - 1 out of 8 guns sold
traced
• Maryland Small Arms Range
(also in PG): 1 out of 24
traced
Small number of dealers accounted
for bulk of guns that we could trace
in DC and PG.
Our reporting confirmed that little
had changed from when Realco
was identified as a top source
dealer in the 1990s.
We found store in full
compliance with ATF and state
police – very clean inspection
records.

Hidden Life

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/nation/guns/
Many people worked on this story, which was part of a longer series “Hidden Life of Guns”; Much of the
interactive stuff done by Wilson Andrews. James Grimaldi, Sari Horwitz and Cheryl Thompson also reported
and wrote stories in the series.

3 > Track the sound of gunfire
• DC is one of about 60-70 agencies nationwide using a gunshot
detection system called ShotSpotter.
• Hidden, rooftop microphones across parts of DC are activated by
percussive sounds. The sensors capture the sound, computer software t
triangulates the location, analyzes and classifies the acoustic signature.
Dispatchers then verify the alert and dispatch officers accordingly.
• Can pinpoint source of gunfire to within a matter of feet. Gives cops
somewhere specific to search vs. vague “I heard gunfire outside”
reports.
• All of this gets logged in a simple database in real time,
• After a source told me in passing that DC’s system was logging
THOUSANDS of gunshots a year, Andras Petho and I requested a
complete copy of the underlying database.

The data.
• Initially, DC police wanted to give us thousands and
thousands of PDFs.
• After several rounds of back and forth, Andras Petho and I
were able to get a data extract dating back to 2006 or so.
For each sound captured it listed:
– Classification
– Time
– Date of gunshot
– Latitude and longitude
– A unique tracking number

Looks like this:

Revealed: 39,000 gunshots

Over six years; numbers not publicized by police.
Another window unto gun-related crime, a fuller picture of gunplay than is
generally known.
Experts will tell you, most gunfire is never reported to police, especially in
crime ridden areas where residents come to accept as background noise.
We found clusters, very similar to what we saw with gun recoveries (perhaps
not surprising).
We also found system not perfect: Missed a few outdoor and logged some
fireworks as gunfire.
Andras Petho, Dan Keating, Ted Mellnik, Emily Chow, Todd
Lindeman, Bonnie Berkowitz, Emily Chow, and James Smallwood worked on
it too.

Some advice re: ShotSpotter …
• ShotSpotter does NOT disclose its list of clients
and leaves it up to its agency-clients to selfidentify. You’ll have to report locally on that.
• DC police had to have some help from Shots
potter to disclose data. Didn’t contend it was not
public, just did know how.
• Many cities, apparently, only using Shots potter in
specific areas. DC uses it in about 1/3 of city.
• Reach out to ShotSpotter: I found them open and
very responsive to our many, many questions.

4 > Some final thoughts
• Spend time taking local inventory:
• In many states, the state police conduct gun-related enforcement and
background checks. This may generate pools of unexplored data.
– In Virginia, for example:
• State police keep a database that records gun sales by dealer,
generated as a byproduct of the background checks they
conduct. Does not have same level of detail as Maryland, but
can give you gun sales by dealer, dates and gun types. Public
pursuant to FOIA.
• Virginia also maintains a little-known database of crime guns
called the “Virginia Criminal Firearms Clearinghouse.” For
many guns, it includes the results of the ATF trace. I used this
as basis for a separate investigation of how crime guns and
trafficking in that state. Also public pursuant to FOIA.

And finally…
• Scrape and mine local and federal courts for gun trafficking cases.
Combined, these cases may surface patterns of interest.
• FOIA or get ATF’s regulatory data. It will be redacted and limited, but
offers a window unto federal enforcement and is better than nothing.
– Helpful: ATF puts FFL licensees on website for downloading;
spreadsheets or CSV files.
– Better: Nspect/Nforce database: ATF regulatory case mgt system
shows inspections and some limited info on what they found at
FFLs nationwide. Have to FOIA.
– Best: Adverse Enforcement/Actions dataset: this lists the FFLs the
agency seeks to close or penalize for significant lapses (like guns
gone missing). Not publicized, but FOIA-able.
