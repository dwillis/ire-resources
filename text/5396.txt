Crea3ng a project:
OpenReﬁne opens in a browser window, but it works oﬄine. It tends to open best in Chrome.
SomeCmes there’s a lag, but if it won’t open, try closing Chrome completely.
Choose "Create Project,” then upload Donovan-A75335
EFSRECB.TXT is the record layout
Donovan_data_dicConary is the data dicConary
Choose CSV as the ﬁle type. You can also import other ﬁle types, then export them as a CSV. This
is helpful for converCng formats like JSON and XML.
For this ﬁle, the columns are separated by commas. You can also paste any delimiter into
“custom.” For example, federal campaign contribuCon ﬁlings are o0en pipe-delimited.
Keep the opCon checked to parse the ﬁrst line as column headers. SomeCmes your data won’t
have column headers — for example, quarterly campaign data that you’ll append to the
previous ﬁlings. You can either manually enter column header names in OpenReﬁne, or export
the data without column headers. Once you create a data cleaning script in OpenReﬁne, you
can re-run it on new data, so this is really helpful if you’re working with regular releases of the
same dataset.
Rename the ﬁle “Donovan” and click "create project" in the top right corner.

Your row count is at the top — 2,045 rows.
Show 50 rows at a Cme, and on the top right, scroll through the data by clicking “next."
You'll also noCce new columns: Stars (good records), Flags (bad records), and the record
number.
Remove the empty columns: CONTRIB_TYPE_CODE_25 is always empty, so click the down arrow
on the column, click Edit Column, Remove This Column:

You can also collapse columns you don’t need to see. Click the down arrow on the column, click
“View,” “Collapse Column.” The column is hidden but will remain in the same place when you
export your data. You can also collapse all columns to the le0 or right of a column.
Under “Edit column,” select “Rename this column,” then change “E_Year” to “Year.”

TRANSFORMATIONS
Text Transforma3ons:
To see the categories (or "facets") for each column, click the down bu#on, "facet" and then the
type of facet (text, number, etc). We'll start with CONTRIB_CODE. Select "text facet.”

We have some issues: COM and Com, LLC and llc, should not be coming up as separate
variables. This is easy to ﬁx with OpenReﬁne’s built-in common transformaCons.
Under CONTRIB_CODE, select “Edit cells,” “Common TransformaCons,” “To uppercase.”

You sCll have duplicates. This is probably because of spaces in the data, another common issue
that will make your analysis inaccurate. To check, click one of the duplicate facets (CORP ), then
click the cell, and you can see there is a space. You can just remove that space and then click
"apply to all similar cells.”
You can also select “Trim all trailing and leading white space” under common transformaCons.
Now change CORPORATION to CORP and INDIV to IND.
If you sort by count, you’ll see that the top Contrib_Code is “IND” with 1,156 records.
Close this window by clicking the upper le0 corner of the window.

Duplica3ng Columns:
Duplicate the “TRANSACTION_CODE” column by selecCng “Edit Column” then “Add column
based on this column.” You should get a screen like this. In “Expression” just leave it as “value”
because we’re only doing an exact duplicate of the column.

You can also write expressions. Under language, you have the opCon of GREL, Python/ Jython,
or Clojure. Here is a list of some GREL funcCons to play around with:
h#ps://github.com/OpenReﬁne/OpenReﬁne/wiki/GREL-FuncCons
Now do a text facet on the new transacCon code. Reference the data dicConary to add the
deﬁniCons for the transacCon codes.

Date Transforma3ons:
On the “New_Date” column, select “Sort,” “As date.” You'll noCce it doesn't sort. That's because
the column is not forma#ed as a date.
Under “Common TransformaCons” transform the column to a date. You can then do a “Timeline
Facet” and ﬁlter your data by the date. This allows you to see any strange outliers. For example,
someCmes your data may a few records with inaccurate years. You can easily see that here.

If you made a mistake, you can always go back a few steps, even months later. Your change
history is saved with your project forever. In the upper-le0 corner, next to Facet/ Filter, click
"Undo/ Redo," then go back to your third step.
Under this opCon, you can also “Extract” your change history and “Apply” it to other datasets:

Numeric Facet:
Change “AMOUNT_70” to a number format. You’ll know it’s forma#ed as a number because it
turns green.
View this column as a numeric facet. A chart will show you the contribuCon range: 0 to
$310,000.
Adjust the slider to view his contribuCons between $300,000 and $310,000. You’ll see just one
from Tusk Strategies Inc.
You can also view the same informaCon as a text facet. Sort by “Count” and you’ll see $500 was
his most common contribuCon amount.

CLUSTERS
View “CORP_30” as a text facet and scroll down. You'll see a lot of examples of two contributors
that are the same but are wri#en slightly diﬀerently. If you do your analysis without ﬁxing this, it
will be wrong. But there are too many to change them all manually.
When making substanCal changes to a column (beyond just converCng to all caps or deleCng
spaces), it’s o0en a good idea to create a duplicate column so you don’t lose the original as your
reference point. Company names are perfect examples — someCmes a slight diﬀerence in one
or two characters really does mean it’s a totally diﬀerent company backed by a totally diﬀerent
group of people. You wouldn’t want to do a story that Donovan got $1 million in contribuCons
from Corrupt LLC (combining his contribuCons from Corrupt Corp and Corrupt Inc), only to ﬁnd
that Corrupt Inc is backed back a totally diﬀerent group of corrupt people who only gave
$50,000 for poliCcal favors.
Call the new column “CORP_C” (“C” stands for Clean).
Under text facet, you have 545 categories. If you trim trailing and leading white space, collapse
consecuCve whitespace, and convert to uppercase, you should get 530 categories.
Now take out the commas and periods by going under “Edit cells,” and “Transform”:
value.replace("," ,"")
value.replace(“.” ,"")
The le0-hand column shows the original data; the right-hand column the data with your
expression applied:

You can always undo your transformaCons if you’ve made a mistake. Your history also shows
how many cells were transformed by a funcCon:

Before you “Cluster,” sort the CORP_C column by text value. Then, in the text facet box, select
“Cluster.”
There are a variety of cluster funcCons. You’ll see the selected values to cluster, an opCon of
whether to merge them, and the new suggested value, which you can change.
Select all the ones that are the same, “Merge Selected & Recluster.” You can then just click
through all the keying funcCons.

If you’re not sure if two clusters are the same enCty, you can select “Browse this cluster” by
hovering over the bo#om right of the two selecCons. Just those records will open in a new
window. Since they have the same address, they are likely the same enCty.

SPLITTING AND TRANSPOSING COLUMNS
Duplicate your “First Name” column, creaCng a new column called “New_Name.” We're going
to put the middle iniCals into their own column.
Under edit column, select “Split into several columns.”
Split by separator, and instead of a comma, make the separator a space. You can also split by
character length, taking the ﬁrst two characters, for example, if you have place codes at the
beginning of a record number.
You'll see this actually created four columns. See why with a text facet. Since this is only a few
records, you can just manually ﬁx them.
Delete the empty columns.
Now under edit cells, cluster, and then run an expression to remove the periods. We want to
now transpose NEW_NAME_2 with MID, calling it NEW_MID.
You can check to see if there are any records with informaCon in both the NEW_NAME_2
column and the MID column with an inverted ﬁlter on NEW_NAME_2:

Chose “Transpose,” then “Cells Across Columns into Rows,” selecCng columns NEW_NAME_2 to
MID_INIT_42 into one new column, called NEW MID. Do not ignore the blank cells.

Do custom facet by number of characters, and ﬁlter for only those above two characters. You
can add a column based on the results called MID LONG, then do the same for those with only
two characters called MID SHORT.
Export the ﬁle as an Excel spreadsheet.
