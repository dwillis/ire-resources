Three key steps
1. Chart a reporting path
2. Organize what you have
3. Report for story

How projects come up short
• Too much traditional he said, she said. I want to
hear from the reporter, not the same old
stakeholders. Avoid other people’s work except to
buttress, or dispute, your own
• Dense and unreadable
• Errors in fact and judgment. That often equates
to over-reaching or misplaced outrage.
• Too explanatory, not enough conclusions
• Unsatisfying examples. (I don’t feel sorry for the
victims, or there were no actual repercussions,
just the possibility of them)

Charting a path

Outline a series
of reporting
steps that will
get you where
you want to go.
Discuss each
step, how long it
might take and
the order of
each task.
Craft a written
plan and check
in at each
deadline you
set.
Treat these like
brief scouting
missions. Decide
after each one if
the story is
worth chasing.

Step 1 – What’s already been written
• Look for other projects on the same subject
• Look for breaking news stories
• Who’s chattering about your subject
• Look outside your coverage area/state

Gut check
• Has this story already been written?
• Is there uncharted ground? Local version of
the story? Broader approach? Unanswered
questions? Different angles?
• Is there evidence that your problem is
widespread?
• How hard was it for others to do similar
stories?

Step 2 – Identify your data
Every big investigative story
needs data. The trick to great
stories is finding the right
data.
Interviews? Public records?
Electronic databases?
Either way, the best sources
are the ones no one has
mined.

• What records can help you answer questions?
• What data exists?
• How hard will it be to get your data and documents?
• Get a sample

Gut check
• Do you have the expertise, time and money to
get the data?
• Is it worth it?
• Is your sample data holding up? Are you the
anecdotes supporting your story premise?

Step 3 – Find a guide (or two, or three!)
Early in the scouting
process, identify a
few experts. Talk to
them about what you
think you know, what
you expect to find
and the data you
plan to examine.

Can they help you
chart your reporting
path?
Gut check: Do they think you’re crazy?

Successful scouting
Good scouting is about testing your perceptions. Use it to challenge
what you think you know, manage your commitment to the story and
avoid rabbit holes.
• Don’t over-commit. Break steps into one to two week reporting
sessions and decide at each step if the story is holding up.
• What sources of data exist and what barriers are there to getting
them?
• Define the local impact/significance of the story.
• Identify expert(s) to help test our project thesis and themes.
• Determine the scope of the story…local, state, national etc.
• Does the idea have timeliness?
• Can examples, anecdotes and people be found to illustrate the
story?

Questions to ask now and later
• Do you have villains? Who screwed up? Can
you name names?
• What do you WISH you could say, but you
can’t (This is the editor’s most important job.
You should do this early and often)
• Are there real repercussion to what you’re
exploring
• Can you articulate realistic solutions? That will
help you identify bad guys.

Organizing what you have
At the end of your
scouting missions, you
should have enough
information to see the
possible stories.
What do you do now?

Step 1 – Your findings
• Early in the process, reporters should write out their
findings.
• Focus on things you’ve uncovered that no one else
knows.
• Key facts and figures
• Conclusions about what’s wrong and who is to blame
• A typical project might start with 20
• Winnow them down to the most important
• Organize them into buckets by theme (these buckets
are markers for how to divide your series into stories)
• Often these become bullets in your stories

Step 2 – Write early and often
• How we did it story (pat yourself on the back a little)
• Write a primer on background and how things work
• Build dossiers on key victims, villains and anecdotes
• Timelines
• Build graphics and charts as you go
• Quick story drafts even before your think you’re ready

All of these will help you connect
the dots, identify holes that need
to be filled and make life easier
when you start to write

Reporting for story
Investigative projects can go off the rails at any
point along the way. It often happens here. You
have good stuff now, but is it bullet proof? Do you
have the material to actually tell the story in a
compelling way?
Often your reporting isn’t done.
Don’t pull up short. Find the holes and go fill them.

Gut check
• Do you have the right anecdotes?
• Do you have enough anecdotes?
• Are your examples too concentrated?
• Are people going to get pissed?
• What do you WISH you could say, but you
can’t yet (remember this one?)

Writing the story
• The best stories have victims and villains. They
bring emotion to your numbers. And readers
want someone to blame.
• Don’t overload with anecdotes for the sake of
anecdotes. Focus on 1 or 2 people. Show scope
with quick examples. Use the worst, or the best
as an illustrative example.
• Use people to illustrate key points from your
bullets/findings and take care of explanatory
sections.

A typical story outline)
Your lead section
• Lead
• Bullets
• Bad guys’ response
• To be sure
• Expert testimony
Body
• Key Background section
• Chapters built around your findings

Generating story ideas
Good stories come from everywhere: Breaking news,
beat reporters’ story lists, stealing other’s ideas,
identifying key issues in your community

1. Search your beat the right way. Uncover waste, mismanagement
and villains.
2. Set aside time to read great stories written by others. Steal their
ideas.
3. Mine breaking news. What stories are worth quantifying? Can
you uncover more villains? Can you grade the performance of an
agency on a larger scale?

Choose the right stories. Make sure you are
PROVING or QUANTIFYING.
