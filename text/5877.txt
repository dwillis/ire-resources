By Melissa Bailey/ Kaiser Health News/ @mmbaily/ melissab@kff.org
For an investigation published in 2018 (https://khn.org/news/dementia-and-gun-safety-whenshould-aging-americans-retire-their-weapons/), reporter JoNel Aleccia and I uncovered more
than 100 cases from 2012 to 2018 in which people with dementia used guns to
kill or injure themselves or others.
Here are some data sources we found helpful.
Data Sources
• Local news clips
• Gun Violence Archive https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/ (based on
news reports -- incomplete)
• Death Records (see below)
• Hospital Discharge Data
• Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System -- state surveys may include
gun ownership
• Gun Violence Restraining Orders
Death Records
Not all states make this information public. But some do, including lots of details
such as name, location, and primary and secondary causes of death.
Records are available in bulk from these seven states:
Connecticut
Georgia
Massachusetts
Minnesota
North Carolina
Ohio
Washington
Medical Examiner/Coroner records
Vary by county
Not all deaths included
Success FOIAing bulk records from counties in Texas, Minnesota & Florida
Gun Violence Restraining Orders
Some states (list here: https://www.thetrace.org/2018/03/red-flag-laws-pending-bills-tracker-nra/)
have “Red Flag Laws” allowing family or law enforcement to petition a court to
seize weapons from someone who is deemed a danger to others. Depending on
the state, the warrants/restraining orders may be public record. In Connecticut
and California, we got records from state courthouses that included detailed
narratives.
