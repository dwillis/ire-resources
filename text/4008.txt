Precision Journalism
By Philip Meyer

Why use data and
documents?
• Get beyond “he said, she
said” stories
•Understand the story
“behind” the story
• Prove the SCOPE of a
problem
• Answer the unanswerable
• Expose patterns in large
amounts of information
• Uncover great anecdotes
(outliers)
• Build interactive “stories”
online

The FIRST questions to ask
When a reporter approaches me about a story or
project, I always start with these three questions:
• What public records exist
• What data exists
• Can you move past the anecdotal to prove SCOPE

Where to start?

Change the way you think
• Documents and data are tools to answer
questions
• ANYONE can use them. In fact, you’re all
probably already using them
• Ignore them at your peril (aka give yourself
some job security)
• Find new ways to use them

How you can use data and
records
• Beat coverage
Incorporate records searches into your routine
Ask for records no one else is reviewing
Find off-the-beaten-path programs and dig in

• Answer specific questions
Documents and data talk when no one else will

• Resources
Some data is worth having around for general reporting
Voter rolls
Utility data
Property records

Using police records

In God’s Name
Abuse at unlicensed religious homes

This story started as a tip about one abusive
school. Using data and public records, the
reporter uncovered chronic abuse at schools
across the Florida.

Children have been exercised to the verge of
death, locked in make-shift cells for weeks,
whipped, punched and forced to stand in
place until the wet themselves. State
officials ignored it all.

Unfit For Duty

Meet German Bosque, the worst cop in Florida

By Anthony Cormier & Matthew
Doig
SARASOTA HERALD_TRIBUNE

G

erman Bosque's personnel file

looks more like a rap sheet than a
résumé.
In two decades, the Opa-Locka
Police Department opened 40 internal
affairs cases on Bosque. Sixteen of
them were for battery or excessive
force.
Fired five times and arrested three,
he was charged with stealing a car,
trying to board an airplane with a
loaded gun and driving with a
suspended license.
Internal Affairs investigations found
that Bosque split a man's lip with a
head butt.

He opened another man's head
with a leg sweep and takedown. He
spit in the face of a drunken,
stumbling arrestee. One time, he
smacked a juvenile so hard the boy's
face was red and swollen the next
day.
Bosque has been caught defying
direct orders, lying to supervisors
and falsifying police reports. Off
duty, he was accused by women of
domestic violence and stalking.
During inspections, the agency
found a counterfeit $20 bill, cocaine
and crack pipes in his patrol car.
Still, Bosque has kept his badge.

Using charity records

Charities file a lot of
public records. Here are
some we used:

• Solicitation reports from 3
states
• IRS 990s
• State required audits
• Regulatory actions from
40 states
• Recorded phone calls
• State-approved scripts
• Criminal records

The 50 Worst

State actions database
For the first time, state
regulators across the country
have a resource to find
charities that have been in
trouble somewhere else.
This database contains nearly
9,000 actions going back a
decade. It already has been
used to identify charities that
lied on applications.

Using real estate records

This series grew out of a
daily beat reporting
about a single land deal
that defied common
sense.
We asked the basic
question: How many
similar deals are out
there?
We struggled for years
to find a cache of public
records.
We finally found our
answer – grunt work.

Using school records

Teachers who fail
In Florida, the results of certification tests for
teachers are public.
We requested that database and a database of
where teachers worked, with Social Security
numbers (yes they were public)
We analyzed test results and layered in data on free
and reduced lunch, and minority population for
each school

Seriously…he said that.

“It’s not like they were that attractive.
You had to wonder why he would do it.”

“How do I love you, let me

…I love your sparkling brown

isn’t like she committed lewd and
lascivious acts.”

Beat strategies
Look for opportunities to PROVE and QUANTIFY
•

Find new sources of information
–
–
–
–

•

Grade the agency you cover
–

•

What programs are not working? Where is money being wasted? How does your agency compare to others?

Follow the money
–
–
–

•

Look beyond the routine for information. Databases, public records, audit reports, internal investigations and surveys
can all lead to Watchdog stories that would otherwise remain hidden.
Put in a new public records request each week
Find out what data your agency collects and regularly analyze it
Generate top-ten lists (biggest bonuses, biggest cell phone bills, most water used)

Discover new govt programs and pools of money
Think small. Look at expenses off the beaten track.
Grants, bonuses, perks, overtime

Uncover villains
–

Think about your beat checks as a way to ferret out misdeeds
