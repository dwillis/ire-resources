Unsung Documents
IRE Conference, Philadelphia, June, 2015

time.'' -- I.F. Stone

Some of the best documents you'll ever use are little-known ones that you probably
haven't found yet. Always assume the document you need exists somewhere. There's a
continually expanding lode of documents to be mined.
Jim, Mike and Joe's five tips for finding and using documents:
1. Never view documents in a vacuum. Combining two or more documents, or documents
and interviews, is often the key to investigative stories. Such triangulation unlocks the
full potential of unsung documents and sources.
2. Always view documents over time; compare this year's annual report to ones published
five and ten years ago. Build a chronology to tease out patterns. Scan documents and run
character recognition software on them, so they're fully searchable.
3. Use the federal Freedom of Information Act and state open records laws. Yes it takes
time, yes there are delays. Yes there are stupid decisions. But sometimes they work and
work well. Either way, we have a constitutional obligation to keep the machine well
greased.
4. If someone refers to or reads from a document during an interview, ask for a copy.
Carry a thumb drive so there's never an excuse for someone not to copy what
you want. A cell phone camera can stand in as an a photocopier.
5. Make copies of -- or better yet, scan -- your documents before you start marking them
up. That way, when the graphics folks ask for copies, you won't feel so dumb.

Here are a few of our favorite documents. Create your own checklist:
-- Lawsuits. It doesn’t matter who won or lost; discovery is a great tool.
-- Form 990 tax reports for nonprofits. Get them at Guidestar.org
-- Personal financial disclosure reports filed by public officials
-- Reports issued by inspectors general, the General Accounting Office, congressional
oversight committees and state auditors.
-- Raw notes and transcripts of interviews made by government investigators and
auditors; drafts and early, unedited versions of audit reports or investigations. (The GAO
has a policy of trying to honor requests for documents used in audits.)
-- Political campaign contribution reports and databases.
-- Docket pages at federal agency websites.
-- Administrative Law judge opinions at various federal agencies.
-- Statistical Abstract of the U.S. (Contains thumbnail tables of every kind of statistic)
-- OMB Filings: A little known source of information about federal grants to states, local
governments and non-profits. Website: http://harvester.census.gov/fac/dissem/entity.html
-- Government cell phone, calling card and 800 number billing records for public
officials. Allows you to track their movements and contacts.
-- Desk appointment calendars and visitor sign-in logs.
-- Gasoline credit card receipts for government cars; tracks officials’ movements.
-- Raw documents public officials keep to complete personal financial disclosure reports.
(Allows you to obtain the relevant information in real time, without waiting a year or
longer for its release on an official reporting form.)
-- Flight logs and manifests for publicly owned or nonprofit aircraft. Lists passengers.
-- Letters from companies and individuals commenting on proposed regulations.
-- Financial and performance reviews conducted by internal and external auditors.
-- Company press releases, many archived by PR Newswire. Good for finding fibs.
-- Industry magazines & newsletters, for insider info not originally meant for a broad
audience.
-- Lists of opinions and letters issued by your state's attorney or ethics officer.
-- Monthly lists of documents filed with your state's archives.
-- Facebook and other social networks.
-- Internal newsletters at private companies and government agencies.
-- Corporate annual reports.
-- Internal telephone directories, especially old ones, which may list former employees.
-- Unemployment and worker’s compensation claims.
-- The statutes applying to your subject in the U.S. code, state law and city statute books.
-- Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) filings.
-- Building permits.
-- State legislative research reports.

Board website: MSPB.gov.
