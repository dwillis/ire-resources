* Medical devices improve and save lives, but
governments have allowed products on the
market with little or no human testing that
went on to cause great harm
* Devices pulled off the market in some
countries over safety concerns remain for
sale in other
* The device industry, and the regulators that
oversee it struggle to quickly identify
hazardous implants after they are released,
leaving patients exposed
* More than 1.7 million injuries and nearly
83,000 deaths to medical devices in reports
to U.S. regulators over the last decade

Data can help explore the story systematically
● Machine learning can help explore millions of records in a different way
Recalls can be evidence of a serious problem, but not all recalls are equal
● Medical literature can identify alarming trends that don’t attract wide notice
Lawsuits can also point the way

How to use the Database

Not all devices have
the same name in
different countries.
The quality of the data
varies by country.
Verify that it is the
same device:
Serial number, lot
number.
Not all countries have
a recall classiﬁcation
system by levels of
risk.

The data can have its own challenges
FDA’s Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database

Duplicates
Dirty

Diﬀerent ways of
presenting device names
and manufacturers

Some approaches:
● We looked for unique identifiers and product codes
● We gathered more than 40,000 manufacturer’s subsidiaries to explore events
linked to specific devices and/or manufacturers
