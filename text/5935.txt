bfreskos@thetrace.org

Many PDs some or all of the following data:
●
●
●
●
●
●
●
●

Case Number
Property ID or another unique identifier
Make
Model
Serial Number
Caliber
Firearm Type (Pistol, Rifle, Shotgun, etc.)
Firearm Category or Description (Semi-auto, Full-auto, Revolver, Pump
Action)
● Offense(s) involving each firearm
● Ammunition Capacity
● Status (Evidence, Recovered, Stolen, Safekeeping, etc.)

Finding Data
● Read departmental policies and procedures manuals
● Request information related to departmental recordkeeping systems
● Talk to people who oversee those systems
● You goal is to figure out what sort of information they collect and what their
systems are called:
○

Philadelphia Police Department Directive 5.27 states, “All firearms reported stolen, missing, lost
firearms (sic), and/or firearms recovered by the Philadelphia Police Department regardless of the
reason for confiscation, will be entered into the [Firearm Analysis System] Program.”

○

Therefore, I am requesting an extract of the data maintained in the Firearm Analysis System
Program ….

See this Example Request Template for a general data request

Formulas we’re going to be using can be copied from this website:

https://freskosb5.wixsite.com/excelformula

Data can be downloaded using this link

Using data to determine type and description:
● Types of firearms: pistol, shotgun, rifle, etc.
● Description of firearms: semi-automatic, automatic, pump action, etc.

● Many departments use a two-letter code to denote type and description in
accordance with the NCIC code manual
○

PI = Pistol, Semi-Automatic

○

SP = Shotgun, Pump Action

○

See NCIC Gun Data Codes

Using data to determine Type and Description:
● Open Baltimore_Master

● Insert two new columns to the right of Column AD, “Gun_Type”
○

To insert a new column to the right of Column AD, right-click on Column AE and then click
Insert

○

Right-click on Column AE again and click Insert to create the second new column

○

Label the new Column AE (I labeled it Type_T) and the new Column AF (I labeled it Desc_T)

● Separate two-letter code to isolate Type and Description
○

To isolate the Type code, copy and paste this function into Cell AE2:
■

○

=Left(AD2,1)

To isolate Category, copy and paste this function into Cell AF2

■

=Right(AD2,1)

Using data to determine Type and Description:
● You should end up with a sheet that looks like this:

● Fill the column with the formula:
○

Select both cells AE2 and AF2

○

Hold your cursor over the bottom right corner of the green box so that your cursor turns into a
black plus sign +

○

Double-click

Using data to determine Type and Description:
● Create two new columns to the right of Column AF, “Desc_T”
○

To insert a new column to the right of Column AF, select Column AG, right-click and choose
Insert

○

Repeat those steps to insert second column

○

You should now have two blank columns: Column AG and Column AH

● Label Column AG and Column AH
○

I labeled them “Type_Def_T” and “Desc_Def_T”

● Take note of the two other tabs, Type Table and Desc Table. You’re going to
use these to convert the one-letter codes into their meaning

Using data to determine Type and Description:
● Convert one-letter codes using Index and
Match functions with Type and Description
Tables
○

For Type, insert function =INDEX('Type
Table'!$B$2:$B$8,MATCH(AE2,'Type
Table'!$A$2:$A$8,0)) into cell AG2 and hit ENTER
■

If you were to enter this formula manually,
you would type =INDEX( and then select
the RESULTS RANGE, aka Reference
Array, from the Type Table sheet, as shown
in the photo on the right.

Using data to determine Type and Description:
■

You would enter the rest of the function
up to AE2:

●

=INDEX('Type
Table'!B2:B8,Match(AE2,

■

Here, you will need to select the Code
Range, aka Lookup Array, as shown in
the photo on the right

■

You would then finish the formula so
that you have =INDEX('Type
Table'!B2:B8,MATCH(AE2,'Type
Table'!A2:A8,0))

Using data to determine Type and Description:
■

You would then put $ signs in front of the rows and columns that you want to remain when you
fill down. The final product should look like this:
●

=INDEX('Type Table'!$B$2:$B$8,MATCH(AE2,'Type Table'!$A$2:$A$8,0))

Using data to determine Type and Description:

●

To convert the Description code, insert the function =INDEX('Desc Table'!$B$2:$B$20,MATCH(AF2,'Desc
Table'!$A$2:$A$20,0)) into cell AH2 and hit Enter

●

Fill down the formulas in cells AG2 and AH2

○
○

Select cells AG2 and AH2
Hold your cursor over the bottom right corner of the green box until you get the black plus sign and
double-click

Using data to determine Type and Description:
● Insert Pivot Table to analyze
○

Select All

○

Insert > Insert Pivot Table > New Worksheet

○

Drag YEAR_T into Columns

○

Drag Type_Def_T into Rows

○

Drag Type_Def_T into Values

● Add Description for more granular info
○

Drag Desc_Def_T into Rows

Magazine Capacity
●

Studies show shootings involving
magazines capable of holding high
numbers of rounds typically result in
more fatalities and injuries

●

Some local law enforcement agencies
collect data on the capacity of
firearms recovered in connections to
crimes. File a public records request!

●

Remember to exclude firearms that
do not rely on magazines and ask
about whether capacity includes the
round in the chamber

Analyzing Magazine Capacity in Pistols
● Open Baltimore_PI

● The BPD and other departments count the
number of rounds, or cartridges, that can fit in
the magazine as well as the chamber in
determining capacity.
○

To account for the round that fits in the chamber,
subtract capacity by 1:
■

Create new column to the right of Column AK2,
“Capacity”

■

Label this new column, Column AL, “Mag_Cap”

■

Insert function =AK2-1 into cell AL2, as shown in
the image on the right, and hit ENTER

■

Fill the formula down

● Determine whether magazine is high- or low-capacity
○

Maryland and other states typically define high-capacity magazines as those capable of holding more
than 10 rounds. For more on state laws, see Giffords

○

To denote whether the gun contains a High-Capacity Magazine:
■

Create new column to the right of Column AL, “Mag_Cap”

■

Label this new column, Column AM, “High-Cap?”

■

Insert function =IF(AL2>10,"Yes","No") into cell AM2, as shown in the below image, and hit
ENTER

■

Fill function down

● Analyze using Pivot Table
○

○

Select All
Insert > Pivot Table > Ok
Drag YEAR_T into Rows box
Drag High_Cap? into Columns and Values boxes

Magazine Capacity Resources:
● For an overview of state laws around magazine capacity, see Giffords
●

For more on guns and cartridges, see this write-up

● Mother Jones has done some great reporting on the use of high-capacity
magazines in mass shootings
● For an example of the kind of reporting you can do in your own community, see
this Washington Post analysis about the drop in high-capacity magazine
recoveries during the federal gun ban. See also this reporting from The Trace
● See this academic paper on the use of high-capacity magazines in crime guns

Ammunition Caliber
● Caliber is a measurement of a bullet’s diameter, either in metric increments or
fractions of an inch.

● Higher caliber bullets, particularly .40 and .45, wreak greater havoc on human
bodies

Using data to analyze Ammunition Caliber
● Open Baltimore_Pistols_I_R
● Create new column to the right of Column AE, “Caliber”
● Label this new column, Column AF, “Cal_T”
● Isolate the numbers in the CALIBER column by pasting the function
=SUMPRODUCT(MID(0&AE2, LARGE(INDEX(ISNUMBER(--MID(AE2, ROW(INDIRECT("1:"&LEN(AE2))), 1)) *
ROW(INDIRECT("1:"&LEN(AE2))), 0), ROW(INDIRECT("1:"&LEN(AE2))))+1, 1) *
10^ROW(INDIRECT("1:"&LEN(AE2)))/10) into cell AF2 and hit ENTER

Using data to analyze Ammunition Caliber
● To flag the .40s and .45s:
○
○
○
○

Create a new column to right of Column AF, “Cal_T”
Label this new column, Column AG, “40s_45s_T
Insert the function =IF(OR(AF2=40,AF2=45),"YES","NO") into cell AG2 and hit Enter
Fill the formula down

● Use Pivot Table to analyze
○

○

Select All
Insert > Pivot Table > OK
Drag YEAR_T to Rows box
Drag 40s_45s_T to Values box

Ammunition Caliber Sources
● The ATF publishes annual reports on the calibers of guns traced in each state
each year.
○

Manufacturing info available through Firearms Manufacturers and Export Report

○

Crime gun info available through Firearms Trace Data

● If you really want to get into the physics that makes some bullets deadlier
than others, see The Trace’s reporting here, here and here.

Stolen Guns
● It is estimated that some
380,000 guns are stolen every
year
● Theft is a significant source of
firearms on the U.S. black
market
● How can we identify violent
crimes involving stolen guns
and show the impact that gun
theft has on public safety?

● Open Atlanta_Rec
● Clean serial numbers in both Stolen and Recovered sheets
○

Create new column and copy and paste the serial numbers into it. You’ll notice I’ve done this
already in Column J

○

Eliminate extra spaces and hyphens using the following formula:
■

○

=TRIM(SUBSTITUTE(I2,”-”,””)

Eliminate anything that is not a serial number, including “None,” “NA,” “Unknown,” “Unk,”
“Scratched Off,” etc.

● Create new column for Results in both Stolen and Recovered sheets
● Create new column for Match? and insert the following formulas:
○

In Recovered sheet, insert
=INDEX(Stolen!$K$2:$K$10054,MATCH(J2,Stolen!$J$2:$J$10054,0)) in cell L2

○

In Stolen sheet, insert
=INDEX(Recovered!$K$2:$K$13416,MATCH(J2,Recovered!$J$2:$J$13416,0)) in cell L2

● Use Filter to isolate matches
○

Select All

○

Sort & Filter > Match? > Match

● Use Filter to remove matches involving Blank cells
○

Select All

○

Sort & Filter > Serial Clean > uncheck Blanks

● You can also use Filter to isolate stolen guns involved in certain crimes

Stolen Guns
● You can isolate homicides and other offenses involving stolen weapons and
use the case number to request the police report:

Stolen Guns
● Googling the victim’s name can lead you to more information, and to court
records:

Stolen Guns
● In court records is where you
might find the trace report.
You can also try requesting
this from the police
department, but it’s sort of a
legal gray area as to whether
they should share:

Stolen Guns
● You can also request the police report for the theft of the gun using the case
number in the spreadsheet:

Stolen Guns
● Use the information you gathered to map out the life of the gun
