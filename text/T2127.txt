TIPS FROM RICHARD DREZEN
TIP #1
A good starting point in doing any kind of company research, here using Enron as the example, is to check
to see if the company you are interested in has an official web site. A public company like Enron is likely to
have much more information on their web site than a private company. Enron’s web site at
www.enron.comproved helpful from the start. Its searchable collection of press releases archived by year
was essential in confirming employee names and finding data on the partnerships.
TIP#2
Wading through SEC filings can be difficult if one doesn’t know exactly what to look for.
Start with the latest 10-K annual filing for the company in question and focus on the “List of Exhibits,”
which is basically a table of contents itemizing materials referenced on the 10-K and the company’s other
documents. This strategy proved invaluable in trying to find Enron documents that were attached to or
referenced on the 10-K’s.
TIP#3
Looking for a basic thumbnail description on a company? Try Company Dossier on Nexis. Enter the name
of the company or it’s ticker, if public. It will bring up a report consisting of directory-like information,
recent news, business, financial and legal analysis as well as an “intellectual property” section that looks
at some of the company’s patents and trademarks. Company Dossier offered a good overview of Enron and
its various lines of business.
TIP#4
Many bankruptcy courts publish calendars of upcoming activity pertaining to the larger cases.
For Enron, go into http://www.nysb.uscourts.gov and look at the top of the homepage for the
Enron hyperlink. Click on it to bring up the Enron Corp. Calendar which lists courtroom events scheduled
into the autumn of this year.
TIP#5
Don’t’ overlook online database customer support. Occasionally questions arise that only the vendor can
answer by e-mailing them or calling their 800 number. This was especially true looking for Enron
historical data on Bloomberg, requiring extensive search assistance.
