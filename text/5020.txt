The College Scorecard
 First released in 2015
by the Obama
administration
 Data on every college
https://collegescorecar
d.ed.gov/

University of North Carolina-Asheville

Scorecard Payoffs and Pitfalls
• Lots of data on colleges
including some neverbefore released fields
• Loan repayment rates by
college
• Student earnings after
college
• Typical debt loads at
graduation

• Can compare lots of
schools and look at data
over time
• Can localize to your
state or community

• Many fields are ONLY for
students who receive
federal financial aid
(loans, Pell grants).
• Some fields are based on
when students ENTER
college and some are
based on when students
exit. Read the
documentation.
• Be wary of duplicates!
Some schools have many
branch campuses
(especially for profit
schools).

Earnings
Pros

Cons

• How much do students
earn after college?
• Median earnings 6, 8
and 10 years after a
student enters college.
• Includes 10th, 25th, 75th
and 90th percentile for
each college
• Broken down by income
bands reflecting the
student’s background,
and by gender

• Only for students
receiving federal aid
• Includes graduates
and drop outs.
• Does not include
students still in
school, such as law
school.

Default Rates
Pros

Cons

• Available in the College
Scorecard
• But more recent data may
be available here:
https://www2.ed.gov/offices/
OSFAP/defaultmanagemen
t/cdr.html
• The share of students who
actually default on their
loans (go about a year
without making a payment)
• Pro: They’re what is used to
penalize low-performing
schools (by cutting off their
financial aid flow)

• Can be manipulated.
• Only for 3 years after
a student leaves
school—not counted if
leaves later.
• Again, includes
graduates and dropouts

Integrated Post Secondary Education Data System--IPEDS
 Data going back to
the 1980s on every
college

 Hundreds of variables
on enrollment,
demographics,
programs offered,
faculty, finances and
more
 Colleges are required
to fill out survey data
each year

College Navigator
 https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/?q=STANFORD&s=all&id=243744

 Look up individual schools’ data submitted to IPEDS

Graduation Rates
Pros

Cons

• Are students actually
getting degrees?
• Available in IPEDS
going back decades
• The percentage of
students entering
college for the first time
who graduate within X
years and are enrolled
full-time
• Can be broken down by
race and gender

• At some schools the
share of first-time,
full-time students is
really low. Grad rates
don’t reflect parttimers.
• Doesn’t include
transfers. They don’t
exist in grad data.
