What is a “nerd box,” and why do we need one?
●
●
●
●
●

Increase transparency and media’s trustworthiness
Provide more information to readers who want to dig deeper
Verify accuracy during reporting and solicit comments from sources
Offer opportunities for replicability
Call for post-publishing correction

What can we publish in a “nerd box”?
●
●
●
●
●
●
●
●

Where and how you got the data
Description of the data (record layouts and codes)
How did you analyze the data and come to your conclusion
Raw data downloads
Scripts & queries
Explainer video/graphic
How can others replicate the process
Copy of FOIA request, trail of correspondence

Where can we put the “nerd box”?
●
●
●
●
●
●

In story
Bottom of story page
Sidebar
Standalone page (linked from story)
Github
Markdown documents (R or Jupyter notebook)
External blog
Google Doc
PDF

Ground rules and recommended practices
●
●

Avoid jargon
Give a core summary first for general public

●
●
●

Always publish data dictionary together with dataset
Explain your script
Leave your contact information for feedback

How to make the information easy to follow?
●
●
●
●

Avoid jargon
Use first-person pronouns: "How we analyzed…"
Q&A format
Use visual aids (screengrabs, video, or visualization of data relationships)

How to accommodate readers with different interest level?
●

“Nerd boxes” for different uses
○ Data diary: a detailed but informal memo to self
○ Data report: for other reporters and editors
○ Traditional methodology page: for general readers (non-programmers)
○ Replication tutorial: for power users who might want to do more of their own
research and analysis

How to assure readers don’t miss important caveats?
●
●
●
●
●
●

Put it in the story copy
Put it at obvious location
Repetitive mentions
Make caveats part of an interactive
Develop shorthand descriptions of caveats
Have a separate page detailing caveats (if there are a lot)
