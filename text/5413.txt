Scope of the problem? Many states have “opioid dashboards” calling out overdoses, deaths, prescriptions,
by geographical region. Centers for Disease Control has detail and big picture. Examples:

CDC: https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/index.html

What kind of treatment is offered in your state? Most treatment in the U.S. is AA-based, 12-step peer
support. Research has shown that medication-assisted treatment is more successful at keeping people off
drugs and helping them get lives, but it’s controversial (“same addict, new drug”).
