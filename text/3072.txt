Tips and Tricks:
What do you know and where can you find out more about the subject? Start with what you
know. Many times that’s not much more than a name and a hometown. Try to get the
individual’s age if you don’t have a date of birth. Other times you only have a phone number or
the registration number from the side of a private plane.
What’s in a name? Some are very common. Others are fairly unique. Persons with unique
names are usually simpler to verify. You’re more likely to locate persons with common names if
you have additional information, such as age or date of birth, hometown, phone number,
spouse’s name, social security number, etc.
What’s public? It can differ from state to state. Employer information, bank records, medical
records, and social security numbers typically aren’t public. However, in some systems social
security numbers are searchable but not viewable.
Don’t be biased. Question the lack of results: Check for variations or you may be limiting your
results to only incorrect answers. Many databases allow you to use an asterisk to search for
variations. Allow for spaces in words or names containing two capitalized letters.
Examples: Searching for…
- “Marg*” (without the quotes) will find “Margaret,” “Margie,” and “Margret”
- “Tom* or Thom*” (without the quotes) will find “Tom,” “Tommie,” and “Thomas”
- “DeWitt County” or “De Witt County” (with the quotes) will find both variations
No data is perfect: Realize that data entry involves human intervention. You may encounter
typos and errors. That doesn’t mean they aren’t hits.
Some databases strip out special characters, such as hyphens and diacritical marks (i.e. Spanish
accent characters). Search both ways – with and without the special characters – especially if
you get no results.

instructions): http://www.spanishnewyork.com/spanish-characters.html
Search operators are your friends: Narrow your Internet searches by using advanced search
techniques. There is usually a link titled “help,” “search tips,” or “advanced search” on the home
page of all major search engines and searchable databases. The tips describe which search
operators you can use and how to use them.

Example: Google search “+raul +castro -cuba” (without the quotes). Narrows the results to
pages containing both the words “raul” and “castro,” but not “cuba.” This technique will help
you weed out many, but not all, results pertaining to the Cuban leader and make it easier to find
information about the first Mexican-American governor of Arizona.
Finding victim’s family members: Search public records for the victim first. Note current and
previous addresses and phone numbers. Often persons with the same surname live at the same
address or previous addresses of the victim. Search also for persons with the same surname and
phone number. Don’t assume the phone number is listed under the victim’s name.
Obtain a library card from your local public library. Public libraries frequently provide free
online access to costly databases – but only for card holders.
When you get stuck... Ask a librarian for help!

Backgrounding sources
News archives: Search the subject’s hometown newspaper archives. If they are fairly
prominent, you might consider broadening your search to major papers and biographical sources.
• U.S. News Archives on the Web (Special Libraries Association – News Division):
http://metalab.unc.edu/slanews/internet/archives.html
• Major news aggregators, such as Nexis.com, Newsbank.com, www.Dialog.com, Factiva.com
You’re likely to have access to one or more of these resources in your newsroom.

Know the city but not the County? If you’re researching someone who’s hometown is other than
your own, you’ll need to find the County name since many public records are maintained at the
Count Clerk’s office.

Lists counties, county seats, square miles, and year organized. You can also sort the county
