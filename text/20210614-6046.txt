What can we as managers take away from the past year? At the very least, it’s that the job of a
journalism manager is more complicated and requires more thoughtfulness and sensitivity than ever.
This panel conversation discussed how we can help lead and bolster people in times of crisis; how
to maintain focus on goals and priorities (or shift goals and priorities) during these moments, how we
can approach leadership to support colleagues of color and other underrepresented people across
the newsroom, and how we can help lead a way up and out of darkness after exhausting,
emotionally turbulent times.
