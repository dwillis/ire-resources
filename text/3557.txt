Museums have never been more sorely tempted to skirt ethical standards in order to bolster the
bottom line. Selling art from the collection is an easier way to raise cash than soliciting
contributions and government support, which have become particularly hard to get in these
economically challenging times.
Museums’ leading professional associations, in their ethical guidelines, strictly prohibit the use
of art-sales proceeds to defray operating or capital expenses or to pay debts. The public purpose
of museums (for which they receive tax-exempt status) is to preserve, interpret and display the
works of art that they hold in public trust, not to monetize them. Museum-quality works already
in the collection should not be lightly disposed of, even for the purpose of bankrolling a new artacquisition spending spree.
The standard justifications offered by museums for removing a particular work from the
“permanent” collection (a process called deaccessioning) are that the object is of inferior quality,
is rarely displayed, and/or is redundant when compared to other pieces in the collection. Upon
investigation, these representations often prove to be misleading or untrue.
It has become easier in recent years to investigate deaccessions, because the museum field,
which previously leaned towards secrecy, now espouses transparency. If you get stonewalled,
invoke the “T”-word.
Here are some resources and strategies to inform your investigations into museums’ collectionsmanagement deeds and misdeeds:
PROFESSIONAL GUIDELINESS FOR MUSEUMS
Ethical Standards Established by Leading Museum Organizations
A widely accepted rule among museums is that proceeds from deaccessions should be used only
for art purchases or (in AAM’s guidelines, but not AAMD’s) care of the collection. Opinions
vary as to criteria to be used in selecting objects that can be appropriately sold from the
collection.

Association of Art Museum Directors (AAMD), “Professional Practices in Art Museums”
(the just revised 2011 edition):
http://aamd.org/about/documents/2011ProfessionalPracitiesinArtMuseums.pdf [Note: This URL
will get you to the document, even though they misspelled “Practices” as “Pracities.”]
AAMD’s deaccession guidelines, including criteria to be considered in selecting objects for
disposal, are contained in Appendix B. (AAMD is the leading association for art museums.)
AAMD “Policy on Deaccessioning” (2010):

PUBLIC DOCUMENTS
Guidestar: http://www2.guidestar.org/
Reports of nonprofits, including the IRS Form 990 (tax return), which is provided free.
The 990 contains detailed financials, including executive compensation
PACER, the electronic filing system for case records in U.S. Courts (i.e., U.S. District Courts):
http://www.pacer.gov/reg_pacer.html
Free registration; 8 per page for each document viewed (complete texts of filed briefs,
depositions [sometimes very illuminating] and court decisions. Gives you a way to keep track of
the progress of a court case, as new documents are filed. You’ll need the case number or one of
the names of the litigants or respondents to do a search.
Bond prospectuses for financing museum expansions: Available on Bloomberg financial
terminals, which are costly but widely used by financial firms and some newsrooms. (You
should have the bond’s identifying CUSIP number.) Alternatively, you can ask the museum, the
issuer of the bonds or the bank handling the bonds for a copy of the prospectus. The prospectus
provides information about the museum’s finances and tells what the bonds are backed by. (In
some cases, this can be the museum’s collection or its acquisitions endowment---both violations
of AAMD’s professional guidelines.)
Filings with Government Agencies:
One responsibility of State Attorney Generals is to defend the public’s interest in collections that
museums hold in the public trust. This is done by the bureau responsible for nonprofits. (In New
York, it’s the AG’s Charities Bureau.)
Sometimes, museums (either voluntarily or in compliance with requirements) file information
about deaccessions with the Attorney General. Under Sunshine Laws, these should be public
documents. Attorney Generals have occasionally participated in litigation regarding certain
planned or completed museum disposals. These court documents can be very revealing. You can
proactively ask the appropriate assistant attorney general about a problematic planned
deaccession, to see whether the AG plans to investigate or take any action.

Other state agencies may also play a role in overseeing museums. In New York State, for
example, the Board of Regents, which charters the vast majority of the museums in the state, has
adopted new rules governing deaccessions that require museums to file with the State Education
Department an annual list of deaccessioned works:

ART RESEARCH RESOURCES
(useful in assessing the history and importance of deaccessioned works)
Frick Art Reference Library’s “Ask a Reference Question”:
http://www.frick.org/library/reference.htm
Fill out the online request for a librarian to provide you with information contained in the
holdings of one of the finest art-history libraries in the nation. Information can be e-mailed;
photocopies of requested material can be mailed to you for a fee.
The Frick and other art museums have online databases of their libraries’ holdings. Two
examples:
FRESCO: http://arcade.nyarc.org/search~S6
Database of the library holdings at the Frick, Museum of Modern Art and Brooklyn
Museum
WATSON ONLINE: http://library.metmuseum.org/screens/opacmenu.html
Searchable catalogue of Metropolitan Museum of Art’s library holdings
JStor: http://about.jstor.org/
Available at any of 3,000 participating libraries, museums and educational institutions in the
U.S., JStor provides access to searchable scholarly journals and publications. (Art history titles
are listed here: http://www.jstor.org/action/showJournals#43693386)

Sotheby’s:
http://www.sothebys.com/app/search/quickSearch/k2/Search.jsp?coll=liveClosed
You can put a museum’s name in the “Provenance” box to find works deaccessioned by
that museum
Christie’s: http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/advanced_search.aspx
The “advanced search” page for sold lots does not appear to be searchable by provenance
(history of ownership).
RESOURCES OF INDIVIDUAL MUSEUMS
Annual Reports are often published online by museums (usually under such categories as
“About” or “Governance”). If it’s not online, ask the museum if it can send report to you.
Audited Financial Statements: These are often in the annual report or on the museum’s
website. If a museum can’t supply an up-to-date annual report (and/or if the latest 990 tax form
on the Guidestar website is outdated), you can ask for its latest audited financial statement
(which may have more detailed information in the “Notes” than is contained in annual reports or
990s). There may be a line for art-sales proceeds.
Registrar’s Records: A museum should be willing to share with you its registrar’s record for a
given artwork, including provenance information (probably omitting the name of a donor who
confidentially gave it to the museum), as well as exhibition history (including the dates when it
was on view in the permanent collection galleries, as well as in special exhibitions at the home
museum or on loan to other institutions). Knowing this history will help you assess the true
importance (or lack thereof) of the deaccessioned object.
Some museums report deaccessions online. Two examples:
Metropolitan Museum of Art:
http://www.metmuseum.org/about/pdf/annual_report/Objects10.pdf (at bottom of this
page of the annual report)
Indianapolis Museum of Art: http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/deaccession
Many museums have not proactively reported deaccessions. Because museum collections are
held in public trust, it is legitimate to ask for a list of works sold during a specific time period
and to expect transparency about what’s being sold, what criteria were used in selecting them,
and how the proceeds are being used. AAMD’s newly revised “Professional Practices” (linked
above, see p. 20) and its 2010 “Policy on Deaccessioning” (also linked above) now require
museums to publish on their websites information about disposed works.
