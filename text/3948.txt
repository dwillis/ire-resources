IRE TIP SHEET
“SO, YOU’VE BEEN SUED”
IRE Conference San Antonio June 20, 2013 2:30pm
Some deep thoughts:
“Being sued is neither a badge of honor nor a brand of shame.”
“Being sued is expensive, time consuming and not good for job security.”
“You can make a big mistake and not be sued or make no mistakes and be sued.”
“You can be personally named in a lawsuit over a headline, webtease, promo, journal,
blog, Tweet, Instagram, you never even saw, let alone approved.”
JOB ONE: Make sure you and your work are indemnified in writing by you publisher,
broadcaster, online or contract employer. If you are a freelancer get some insurance.
HOW NOT TO GET SUED:










Do you know your state’s trespass, privacy, libel/slander and hidden camera laws
You can make mistakes and not commit libel, slander or defamation, but any factual
error, whether material to the report or not, may be used against you.
Never make disparaging or prejudicial remarks about the subject of an investigation.
Your emails and drafts of scripts/stories can be discovered in litigation. Jokes,
shorthand, loose language, off hand comments on hidden camera tapes create problems.
Do not argue with, make promises to or make admissions if you receive a call from
someone who is threatening legal action. You should make it clear that you are taking
the complaint seriously and that you will immediately pass along the complaint
internally.
If you get a complaint, tell your lawyer and news manager right away. Sometimes
lawsuits are filed because the plaintiff believes it is the only recourse available.
Speak to legal and news management before you make any corrections or clarifications
on air or online.
Make corrections or clarifications promptly whether there is a threat of suit or not –
make sure you get it fixed on all platforms.

About the research:



It is not just about knowing you are right, it is also about being able to prove you are
right.
Get organized. Keep a running memo of who said what when, even those phone calls
not taken, etc. Get it all in a 3 ring binder.

About the interviews and production:




Challenge everybody – you may discover your victim is not one at all - it will also raise
the energy level and give you a better interview
Have you given the subject of your investigation a fair chance to respond to all
questions? Have you considered competing narratives or alternative explanations? Have
you given the subject the benefit of the doubt?
Tell people ahead of time you are coming – call them, email them, write them, send a
certified letter…that way they can never say they were ambushed or did not know you
were coming.

About those hidden cameras…




Do you know the law?
Do you know your company policy?
Will you keep and store the raw footage or not? Be consistent.

About that script…



Read the script four times: 1. Contest, flow, holes. 2. Fairness, balance 3. Wordage,
clarity 4. Now, read it out loud - even you print folks – is it bulletproof?
Then ask yourself, “Who would disagree with this? Have you talked to them? Make a
few more phone calls.

About those promos, teases,






Insist producers and promotions run everything past you and be available day and night
to answer their calls – do not let them say they could not get ahold of you.
Read and watch EVERY blog, journal, headline, and especially promos and teases,
Tweets, Instagrams, etc.
Protect raw video/interviews to make sure others use only what you approve.
Warn promotions and producers they will also be involved in a lawsuit if they make
mistakes.
Web stories live forever. They can be salt in the wound for targets in your
investigations. Lawsuits may come months or years later because they cannot shake off
your reporting.

About those lawyers…


Has your lawyer (and your news manager) approved everything – no story is worth
your being fired over because you did not want to waste the time dealing with them.



You may know journalism, but your lawyer knows the law. Even if you have a law
degree you could use a good lawyer with clear eyes. Listen to her/him. stop arguing for
a minute.

WHAT TO DO AND WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN YOU ARE SUED:









Never take any threat of a lawsuit lightly
Your employer might decide to settle a lawsuit even though you want to go to court –
unless you are paying the bills you probably have no say.
Do not cop to mistakes you did not make or try to play the hero and take the rap for
mistakes made by others.
Your bosses are not your family; a corporation is incapable of love. Be a pro.
You may think your lawyer jokes are unique and hilarious. your lawyer, less so.
It is easy to take a lawsuit personally – but do not get personal. Do not let them
“get your goat.”Snippy, combative or heated exchanges do not score points.
Be a decent human being. Be fair. Be truthful. Show some compassion for everyone
concerned.
