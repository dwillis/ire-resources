Initial FOIA letter
• Took two months to
get response from
CMS.
• Claimed we
couldn’t foia data as
available on Web.
• Refused to even put
that in writing.

http://www.cms.gov/LimitedDataSets/

Lawsuit against CMS
• Initial response
from Department of
Justice – “Can we
settle?”
• Negotiated from
$97,000 to $12,000.
• Claims it lost money
at this price.

Data Use Agreement
• Standard form that
researchers fill out.
• Most of its limiting
factors related to
privacy of patients.
• But other
restrictions place on
naming individual
doctors from this
database.
• Added addendum
to establish our
right to store the
database in our
newsrooms.

CMS claim form
• Allows multiple
procedures on same
claim.
• Most typical
procedures made
up of multiple
codes.
• Carriers allow more
than one event on
the claim.
• Each record in the
database is a claim.

The datasets
From CMS
•Carrier Part B provider (going to see doc)
•Out-patient (In and out of hospital in one day; also group practice.)
•In-Patient (a night or more in hospital)
•Skilled nursing (nursing home)
•Hospice
•Durable medical equipment (late night infomercials)
•MEDPAR (aggregated hospital Part A)
•Denominator (beneficiary info)
Others
•CPT procedure codes and descriptors (AMA)
•ICD-9 diagnostic and procedure codes
•DRG codes and procedures
•NPI and UPIN lookup (Provider ids)

Record layouts / data
dictionary
• Every thing is a
code.
• Some coding can
spread across 45
columns.
• Total dictionary just
under 1,000 pages.

Importing the data
•Each table had between 600 and 1700 variables, way too many for SQL Server
•Used SPSS, broke tables into thirds, retaining linking variables to create three relational
tables.
•Exported each table from SPSS ,year by year, into SQL Server
•Some years/tables took several days and much fretting.

Typical table
• Carrier file 2008
(individual docs’
billing).
• 122 gigs.
• 417 million claims.
• A 5 percent sample.

Standardizing the data
We called it exploding …
In Part B up to 13 procedure-related variables and 30 diagnosis-related variables

Procedure table

Diagnosis table

41 million records became 1.2 billion records (about 700 gigabytes)

Encryption

•In the data, almost all provider ids are encrypted
•Got crosswalk but could not publish names with numbers from data.
•Any names in stories were gathered through independent reporting
•No data on tax id

Permanent injunction
• 1979 court case
where Florida docs
and AMA sued the
old HEW to prevent
naming docs from
the database.
• Still in effect.
• Must sue in
Jacksonville, Fla.
court.

Back to court
• CMS refused access
to some 100
percent files.
• Time to hold docs
accountable.
