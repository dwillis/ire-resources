How a county sheriff in California interfered in death investigations...for years

A Person’s death is
investigated if sudden,
unexpected, violent or
occurs under Suspicious
circumstance...

California’s sheriff-coroner system
In most California counties
the elected sheriff also
serves as the coroner in
charge of death
investigations.
The dual role saves taxpayer
$$$, but also sets up a
conflict of interest...

A forensic pathologist determines the
medical reasons why a person died
The Sheriff-coroner hires
forensic pathologists to
conduct autopsies to
determine the medical
CAUSE of Death (i.e.
asphyxiation, heart attack,
gunshot wound→)

Sheriff-Coroner
The sheriff-coroner uses
the autopsy findings to
determine whether the
death was a homicide,
accident, suicide, natural or
undetermined. This
“MANNER of death” →
Goes on the official death
certificate & gets reported
to federal & state agencies.

(Why + how)
CAUSE
&
MANNER
should go
together!

In San Joaquin County, that wasn’t always the case

In late 2017 Chief Forensic pathologist Bennet Omalu & his colleague Dr. Susan
Parson quit and accused then 3-term Sheriff Steve Moore of interfering in death
investigations.

Dr. Omalu is a renowned neuropathologist who discovered CTE in pro football
players, as depicted in a movie with Will Smith.

An investigation into the doctors’ accusations found that
Sheriff Moore...
●
●
●
●
●
●
●
●

Repeatedly diverged from autopsy findings that a person died at the hands of officers,
“medical homicide” by labeling those deaths “accidental.”
Withheld or suppressed evidence in deaths involving officers
Blocked forensic pathologists from attending complex death scenes
Cut off the hands of bodies for identification without consulting pathologists
Canceled forensic tests, in one case to determine whether a woman was killed
Failed to investigate suspicious deaths, including one fetal death
Released the wrong body to at least 2 families in a single year
Reaped hundreds of thousands of dollars a year by bringing bodies to the morgue
unnecessarily and charging families for the service.

“We went into this long back
and forth, that he doesn't think
it was a homicide because
they didn't mean to kill him.
And I said to him, ‘Sir, it
doesn't matter what you and I
think, we have to adhere to
the standards of practice.’”
Dr. Bennet Omalu,
Chief Forensic Pathologist
San Joaquin County

Wrong Bodies
●

●

●

Doctors alleged the sheriff profited from
charging families $352.00 to transport
their loved one to the morgue, even
when they died of natural causes in a
hospital or under a doctor’s care.
A review of annual reports from the San
Joaquin County Sheriff-Coroner's Office
showed the sheriff made $100,000 a
year in revenue from those potentially
unnecessary transports.
An audit later confirmed that the majority
of corpses brought to the county morgue
should have been released to
mortuarries for burial.

An independent audit confirmed some of the
allegations and recommended changes:

So did voters:

AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE PASSED A
BILL IN 2018 REQUIRING SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY AND
SIX OTHER LARGE COUNTIES TO ADOPT A MEDICAL
EXAMINER SYSTEM OR OTHER CHANGES TO MITIGATE
CONFLICT OF INTEREST IN DEATHS INVOLVING
OFFICERS
Then-Governor Jerry Brown vetoed the measure, saying local officials know
best how to handle death investigations in their counties.

Sheriff Steve Moore left office on December 31, 2018.
Dr. Omalu has a private business conducting autopsies and
testifying as a forensic pathology expert across the county;
Dr. Susan Parson now works for the Santa Clara County
medical examiner’s office in California.
San Joaquin County Supervisors just approved the budget to
hire a medical examiner.

How I reported this series
Earlier reporting on medicolegal death
investigations won trust of forensic
pathologists. Source leaked seven months of
documented misconduct.
Interviewed attorneys for families suing the
sheriff’s department for wrongful death and
other misconduct. Key interviewed with x- wife
of the man who was tased 31 times. She had
just retired from working for Moore.

RECORDS consulted:
●
●
●
●
●
●
●

Searched for cases, queried county
documents on budget and complaints against
Sheriff’s Office
Staked out board meetings- to get sheriff on
record because he refused sit down interview.

Autopsy reports
Death certificates
Civil court filings
Sheriff-coroner’s annual report
Internal sheriff’s department records

PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS
CHARGED WITH
FELONIES IN IDAHO
Audrey Dutton, Idaho Statesman
@audreydutton

The tip: Patients in psychosis were being charged
with felonies, under a law meant to protect health
care workers from abuse

Questions we needed to answer
How big is the
problem?

Is there a case that
exemplifies it?

How did this
happen?

1. How many cases have been
filed?

1. Talk to lawyers who defend
people charged under the
law.

1. Passed by the Idaho
Legislature in 2013.

2. How many involved
psychotic breaks, or severe
mental illness that can
affect a person’s judgment?
3. Exclude cases with drugs or
alcohol?
4. What is the harm being
done by the law?

2. Find someone willing to talk
about their experience.
3. Don’t rely on the patient’s
memory. Get the records:
dispatch log, police report,
patient medical records.

2. Leg. hearing minutes:
Opponents warned these
patients would be arrested.
Proponents promised
existing laws would protect
patients with mental illness.
3. Idaho has no “insanity
defense.”
4. The definition of “intent.”

Data request: Cases that had been filed
under the statute

About 40% of the cases I reviewed involved mental
illness. One case exemplified the problem. The patient
was divorced from reality. Police couldn’t even
interview her.

After our story
ran, a state
lawmaker
introduced a bill
to add a mental
health
exemption.
It failed.

The story: “She went to the hospital for
mental illness. She ended up charged with 2
felonies.”

OPEN MEETING LAW
VIOLATIONS IN IOWA
Sara Konrad Baranowski, Iowa Falls Times Citizen
@skonradb

What’s the
story?
In 2018, while reporting on
another story, Iowa Falls Times
Citizen Editor Sara Konrad
Baranowski noticed that the
county supervisors - the local
county’s elected governing
board - had not been publishing
minutes of public meetings, as is
required by Iowa law. As she
dug in, she learned that 70
percent of the public meetings
in the first six months of 2018
had not been documented.

How was it
reported?
Sara started by compiling a list
of the 108 meetings that had
been held in the first six
months of the year (often
several meetings were listed
on a single agenda document,
so each agenda had to be
reviewed), she determined
whether there were minutes
for each meeting, and
whether the meeting had
been recorded (a feature the
county had touted as its effort
to be overly transparent to the
public).
The county website lists each meeting agenda (on the left). The “Minutes” and “Media”
columns are mostly empty for this stretch of six weeks in early 2018.

How was it
reported?
After compiling a list (David
Fahrenthold-style) of the
meetings, minutes and video,
Sara interviewed county
officials and state open
government advocates about
why the meetings weren’t
documented, what that means
for the public, and whether
(and how) the issue would be
corrected going forward.

How can you
do this story?
Sara will admit that she fell
into this story. But it’s a fairly
simple reporting project to
undertake if you know the
public records laws in your
state, and take the initiative to
check on your local
government’s compliance with
those laws. There’s a lot of
information (or, in the case of
this story, missing information)
tucked away on government
websites. It’s worth your time
to check them out.

Get in touch with Sara!
She loves to talk about
public records!

A SECRET ICE DETENTION
FACILITY IN CALIFORNIA
Kerry Klein, Valley Public Radio
@einekleinekerry

The first steps
ü Obtained redacted govt lease
from GSA
ü Visuals: DHS van parked outside
building
ü Lawyers offered up a name:
“Fresno Hold(ing) Room”
ü Found previous reporting,
confirmed holding rooms in lots
of other cities
ü Searched ICE doc library for
detention standards
ü Audio: got verbal confirmation at
front door

Next: Mountains of data
■ Found recent-ish detainee data from ICE FOIA library
■ Computer couldn’t handle file sizes at first – lots of unnecessary formatting,
macros, sheets
■ With patience, copied data into smaller, more manageable files, then pored
through them
■ Using Pivot Tables, extracted pertinent info: # of hold rooms, # of unique
prisoners in Fresno, gender, ethnicity, age, outcome

The sources
■ Tough to find family members, but lots of attorneys interested, on and off record
■ 2 local attorneys: described what it looked like, told stories of family members being
lost within system for hours to days
■ 1 attorney in NorCal rapid response network: why those first few hours of detention
are so crucial for contacting families and lawyers
■ Human Rights Watch: had their eyes on hold rooms for years, concerned about civil
rights and due process
■ ICE never responded

Advice
■ No evidence of illegal activity?
That wasn’t the point –
transparency is a story too
■ Immigration attorneys = fabulous
resources
■ ICE is notoriously slow at
responding to FOIAs – to save
time, scour FOIA library
■ Get some data experience – you
can do SO MUCH simply using
pivot tables and filters in Excel

A GOLF COURSE GETS
APPROVED ON WETLANDS
IN WISCONSIN
Sarah Whites-Koditschek, Wisconsin Public Radio

The Story: “Former DNR employee: Staff pressured to OK
Kohler golf course on rare Wisconsin wetlands and state park”
■ The manufacturing company Kohler was seeking to get approval to build a golf
course on a tract that included wetlands
■ The company already had been building waterfront golf courses on Lake Michigan,
and this would have been the latest one
■ Kohler executives were big donors to Gov. Scott Walker’s campaign
■ State workers felt pressured to approve the permit
■ LINK: https://www.wisconsinwatch.org/2018/11/former-dnr-employee-staffpressured-to-ok-kohler-golf-course-on-rare-wisconsin-wetlands-and-state-park/

Story highlights

How the story came together
■ The story started with a group of people sharing concerns with the Wisconsin Center
for Investigative Journalism
■ The context was then-Gov. Scott Walker’s administration, and a perception that
science was being undermined
■ There had been a mass exodus from the Walker administration, and some of those
former employees were willing to be very honest

Reporting strategies
■ Started with an off-the-record conversation to get sources comfortable before going
back for on-the-record quotes
■ The reporter dug through hundreds of pages of filings with the Wisconsin
Department of Natural Resources
■ Visit the site with a photographer and a scientist to understand the science and
visualize what was at risk of being built on
■ Drove out to the town of Kohler, a company town, and found people in public places
willing to talk about the company

What happened after the story
■ Other news organizations did similar stories on the proposed golf course
■ A judge threw out the permit that the state had approved

Repeating this story
■ Benefits
– Straight-forward reporting project
– No heavy data analysis involved
■ What it took
– About two months of work
– Scheduling several interviews
– Learning about environmental science

A MEDICAL DEVICE
RAISES QUESTIONS
IN INDIANA
Jake Harper, Side Effects Public Media
@jkhrpr

QUESTIONS RAISED ABOUT
STUDY OF DEVICE TO EASE
OPIOID WITHDRAWAL

Jake Harper, WFYI/Side Effects Public Media
Maria Fabrizio for NPR

-

Clearance is not the same thing as approval. Make
sure your audience knows that.
Class II devices get such as the Bridge do not need
tons of supporting data to get FDA clearance. Look
at the research whenever you hear about a new
one. (You should be doing this already, but just in
case…)

Find an expert who has run experiments themselves
and has knowledge of FDA law. Institutional Review
Boards are a good place to start.

Look at the end of the paper and call the people
in ‘Acknowledgments.’

Emily Forman/Side

Two ideas:
-

Just steal the story.
-

Are they aware the research is questionable?
The FDA has expressed a specific interest in devices that
could help with addiction. Keep an eye on those, and the
research behind them.
- Similar devices could be promoted at state and local
level before reaching FDA.
-

-

Find out where the Bridge is being used in your area,
who’s paying for it, and how much.
