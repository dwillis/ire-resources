Tips
z Subject of investigation

– Ask yourself this question: why do I want this and how
far can I go?
– Or: do I have enough passion for the subject?
– Should I write an article or a book? In the last case:
Why? Does the subject offer enough material for a
book?

Tips
z Pre research
– Do thorough research;
– Talk to others (whether experts or not) about meaning
and feasibility;
– Ask your publisher / editor to become involved;
– Consult the fund (preferably by phone or by mail);
– Use the application of the Fund as a guide.

Tips
z Submit your request
– The project should be equally accessible, clear and
compelling as an article (write a tempting story).
– Let the amount of text be determined by the application
– Check for style, grammar mistakes and inaccuracies.
– The work plan should provide insight into oral and
written sources.
– Set up a timeline

Tips
z How much to ask for?
– Ask a realistic amount of money. Make a detailed budget
(travel costs, wages, overhead, books, magazines, ...)
It’s also useful for yourself.
– Look at other projects that are financed by the fund.
