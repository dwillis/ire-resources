More lead than any other plant in the state;
more acetaldehyde than almost any other plant in the country

State-level
story:
Wisconsin

Cruising for data
• Recreationally

In a more
focused
way
Example:
Tipster said
ethanol company
got big stimulus
funds.
So — how bad was
it, and were there
others?

Possible sources
Geography
• Shapefiles published by state or federal agencies
• Croplands, wetlands, basic geology
• Dams, railroads, highways, basic infrastructure
• Plat maps and real estate
Permittees
• Major air and water polluters ... plus stormwater,
reclamation, groundwater, wetlands, high-capacity wells,
manure management, etc.

More sources
Inspections and enforcement
• Some states are very bad at posting this online (including
Wisconsin), which is where ECHO comes in handy
Historical stuff
• Old industrial sites that could be contaminated now
• Digitized old maps as raster files
Academic research, e.g.:
• Parasites or disease maps (chronic wasting disease in
deer)
• Endangered species, rare resources
• Data presented at conferences

Using data as a reporting tool
Step 1: Map it from the start.

Play. Get to know the shape of the
data, how dirty it is, where it is.

(turns out this one's
probably about veal)

What other data would make your data more
interesting? State, federal; environmental or not
• NASA's aviation
safety data on
strikes/near-misses
• FAA airport
directory
• USFWS wildlife
strikes database
(filtered for large
wildlife)
• WDNR deer
density maps

Using TRI as a tool: do I have a story?

Use RSEI to rank facilities
(but beware of caveats)

Largely based on a single
TRI report later amended.
