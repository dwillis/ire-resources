SPSS 2 -- DOING CROSSTABS TO SHOW THE DATA IN
DIFFERENT WAYS, AND STATISTICAL TESTS
First: Variable view . .. label variables

CROSSTABS
If you have all categorical variables (instead of having a continuous dependent variable and two categorical
independent variables, one of which is something you want to "control" for), you want to get SPSS to produce a
multiple-level crosstab. To do this, you use the following menus and commands:
ANALYZE
DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS
CROSSTABS and then you fill in the boxes depending on your variables. If you want to look at the effect of X on Y, while
controlling for Z (or "holding Z constant"), and put your variables in the following places:

X goes in the "rows" box
Y goes in the "columns" box

Z goes in the box that says "layer 1 of 1"
Crosstabs get messy if you look at more than three variables, so I would think hard before going into any more
layers. Your printout will show a different crosstab for each level of the control variable, Z. To perform an
independent sample t-test, use the following menus and commands:
DATA
SELECT CASES
click "If condition is satisfied" option
click on "If' button
and type in the box which cases you want to look at. For example, say I have a data on dancers licensed to work
in Atlanta's adult entertainment establishments. Let's say I want to compare the hair (variable: hair) and eye
color (variable: eyes) of those dancers who are black (variable: race). After clicking the IF button, I type RACE
= "BLACK" in the box (note that this is case sensitive).
Click continue
Click OK

By doing this, I've temporarily narrowed the dataset so that SPSS will only perform calculations for those cases
that take the value "black" on the "race" variable.
Now when I run the crosstab, SPSS only computes statistics for black dancers.

Crosstab Statistics
When you the various statistical techniques, SPSS will frequently tell you what kind of statistical tests are
available for that procedure. For example, if you ask for crosstabs, SPSS offers a number of statistics based on
the type of data you're using.
The output generated by SPSS includes redundant information. Only a small portion of the output is actually
useful. However, if you are not familiar with the output shown in the table, you can move the mouse over the
table, right click it and choose Results Coach. SPSS will then explain the results to you.

STANDARD DEVIATION: The standard deviation is a statistic that tells you how tightly all the various
examples are clustered around the mean in a set of data. When the examples are pretty tightly bunched together
and the bell-shaped curve is steep, the standard deviation is small. When the examples are spread apart and the
bell curve is relatively flat, that tells you have a relatively large standard deviation.
PEARSON CHI-SQUARE: If Pearson Chi-square < 0.05 you can accept independence; If Pearson ChiSquare > 0.05 you can reject independence.
It can be tricky to interpret the results from crosstabs in SPSS. Consider the example below. We have included
row percentages, column percentages and cell percentages.

1. This is the row percentage (i.e., out of the 26 who are low anxiety, 5 are low tension, 5/26=19.2%).

3. This is the cell percentage (i.e., out of all 48, 5 are low anxiety and low tension, 5/48=10.4%).
4. This is the overall row percentage (i.e., out of all 48 people, 26 were low anxiety, 26/48=54.2%).
5. This is the overall column percentage (i.e., out of all 48 people, 26 were low tension, 20/48=41.7%).

The standard deviation is a statistic that tells you how tightly all the various examples are clustered around the
mean in a set of data. When the examples are pretty tightly bunched together and the bell-shaped curve is steep,
the standard deviation is small. When the examples are spread apart and the bell curve is relatively flat, that tells
you have a relatively large standard deviation.

Comparing Means (T-Test)
The output below shows the comparison between the mean age of sampled residents of Blueville and
Whiteville: testing AGE for values 1 and 3 of ZONE. The mean age in Blueville is about 7 years more than that
in Whiteville. Is that difference statistically significant? Apparently not. The 2-tail significance, 0.063, is greater
than 0.05, and is not small enough to reject the idea that the mean ages are equal. For the same reason, the 95%
confidence interval for the difference between the mean ages includes zero.

Correlation

The output below shows the results of the test of association between income and age. The correlation
coefficient between INCOME and AGE is ,971, which indicates a strong positive relationship. (Numbers close
to 1.0 imply a strong positive relationship, numbers close to zero imply no relationship, and numbers close to 1.0 imply a strong negative relationship.) The significance level, 0.0, suggests that we reject the idea that this
coefficient is close to zero.]

Test of Independence
The output below shows the results of the test of association between EDUCATION LEVEL and ZONE of
residence. The number in each cell of the table is the number of cases with that particular combination of the
two variables. Are the cases evenly spread out among the different values, or is there a pattern to concentrate in
a few cells that is evident? There appears to be a pattern: Blueville and Niceville have higher education levels
than Whiteville. Is this trend statistically significant? Apparently, this is not. The significance of the Pearson
Chi-square statistic, 0.174, is greater than 0.05, and we cannot reject the idea that the two variables are
independent of each other.
