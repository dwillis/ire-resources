“... More than half of migration
into Davidson County over the past
five years — more than 60 percent
last year — has been international
migration. … One out of five … into
the overall Metro area has come from
overseas.”

Seattle Times:
“From 2012 to 2016, an average of
7,900 Californians moved to the city
each year… New York sends us more
than 2,000 people a year. ...The No. 6

Sandwiched … between Colorado
and Florida, it sends us an average of
1,550 people a year: China.”
