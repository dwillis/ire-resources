Tax-Exempt Journalism
✤

What we’ll cover today:
✤

The history of the IRS and journalism

✤

Designing a tax-exempt news business

✤

Staying afloat while waiting for word from the IRS

✤

What you can and can’t do with an exempt organization

✤

Legal assistance and risk management

Thursday, June 14, 12

Tax-Exempt Journalism
✤

Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(3):
✤

Thursday, June 14, 12

Corporations ... organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific,
testing for public safety, literary, or educational purposes, or to foster national or
international amateur sports competition (but only if no part of its activities involve the
provision of athletic facilities or equipment), or for the prevention of cruelty to children
or animals, no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private
shareholder or individual, no substantial part of the activities of which is carrying on
propaganda, or otherwise attempting, to influence legislation ..., and which does not
participate in, or intervene in (including the publishing or distributing of statements),
any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office.

Tax-Exempt Journalism
✤

✤

Primary benefits of Section 501(c)(3) status:
✤

Exemption from federal taxation for income earned in service of a tax exempt purpose

✤

Possible exemption from state taxation

✤

Under Section 170(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, donations to most Section 501(c)(3)
organizations are tax deductible

Section 501(c)(3) status is not automatic for most organizations
✤

Thursday, June 14, 12

Have to satisfy the IRS that you are organized and operating for a tax-exempt purpose

Tax-Exempt Journalism
✤

For most journalism organizations, finding Section 501(c)(3) status will require demonstrating
that they are organized and operated for an “educational” purpose
✤

✤

Invocations of other categories (e.g., “literary”) often disregarded by IRS

The IRS does NOT consider all journalism to be educational

Thursday, June 14, 12

The IRS and Journalism: A Brief History
✤

1851: New York Times is first published

✤

1894: U.S. Congress passes the Wilson-Gorman Tariff Act, the first federal income tax
✤

Contains exemption for “corporations, companies, or associations organized and conducted
solely for charitable, religious, or educational purposes”

✤

NYT is NOT exempt from taxation

✤

Life goes on that way for sixty+ years

Thursday, June 14, 12

The IRS and Journalism: A Brief History
✤

1954: U.S. Congress passes the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, containing Section 501(c)(3) in
its more or less final form

✤

1954: National Educational Television, with grant from the Ford Foundation, begins operating
the first noncommercial television network

✤

1967: U.S. Congress creates Corporation for Public Broadcasting to fund NET
✤

Thursday, June 14, 12

Also intended CPB to create a network to replace NET, due to perceived political slant of the
network

The IRS and Journalism: A Brief History
✤

1969: CPB launches the Public Broadcasting Service to replace NET

✤

1970: CPB launches National Public Radio

Thursday, June 14, 12

The IRS and Journalism: A Brief History
✤

So, by the late 1960s/early 1970s the IRS is looking at:
✤

More than sixty years in which journalism has operated and been taxed as a for-profit
concern, despite exemptions for nonprofit educational organizations

✤

The appearance of “noncommercial television” in the form of NET

✤

The fact that Congress recognized the value of educational television programming by
creating CPB to support NET

✤

The fact that Congress was nevertheless concerned enough about biased viewpoints to
replace NET with PBS and NPR

Thursday, June 14, 12

The IRS and Journalism: A Brief History
✤

What does the IRS take away from this?
✤

IRS is bound to carry out the intent of Congress

✤

IRS’s primary duty is to protect the public treasury by ensuring that tax exemptions are only
granted to the correct entities -- including educational organizations

✤

Some journalism, publishing and broadcasting might be educational -- but not all of it

✤

There is concern about bias

✤

Need to develop standards to distinguish “educational” media from other media

Thursday, June 14, 12

IRS Standards for Journalism

✤

Key IRS Precedents for Tax-Exempt Journalism
✤

Revenue Ruling 67-4: four part test for identifying educational publications

✤

Revenue Ruling 77-4: holding that traditional newspapers are not tax-exempt

✤

Revenue Procedure 86-43: four part test for distinguishing education from advocacy

Standards for whether content is “educational” often cross line into questions of whether
organization is operated to benefit private individuals, or other parts of Section 501(c)(3)

Thursday, June 14, 12

IRS Standards for Journalism
✤

Revenue Ruling 67-4:
✤

Thursday, June 14, 12

An organization ... may qualify for exemption from Federal income tax under section
501(c)(3) of the Code if
✤

(1) the content of the publication is educational,

✤

(2) the preparation of material follows methods generally accepted as ‘educational’ in
character,

✤

(3) the distribution of the materials is necessary or valuable in achieving the
organization's educational and scientific purposes, and

✤

(4) the manner in which the distribution is accomplished is distinguishable from ordinary
commercial publishing practices.

IRS Standards for Journalism
✤

Revenue Ruling 67-4: Content
✤

Format - is information conveyed in an educational way ("public discussions, forums,
lectures, panels, and other similar programs")?

✤

Support - is the information presented with factual support commensurate to the nature of
the message being conveyed?

✤

Instructional method - does the material include both facts and analysis of the facts?

✤

Tailoring - does the presentation of the information take into account the audience's
background or training in the subject matter?

✤

Targeting - does the education or instruction support a public interest, or does it primarily
serve the members of the organization seeking the tax exemption?

Thursday, June 14, 12

IRS Standards for Journalism
✤

Revenue Ruling 67-4: Preparation
✤

✤

Thursday, June 14, 12

IRS internal memoranda have indicated that it helps if the ...
✤

... organization is run by experts in the relevant field

✤

... selection process for articles is based upon their educational value rather than
commercial appeal

✤

... focus of articles is on issues of public policy rather than issues of mass appeal

✤

... content is written by leading authors, journalists, professors and educators

These are factors, not a list of requirements

IRS Standards for Journalism
✤

Revenue Ruling 67-4: Distribution
✤

Thursday, June 14, 12

"Certainly there is no better way to capture the attention of a widely dispersed public. The
publication of literature is, concededly, the common method in carrying out the religious
and educational purposes of any exempt organization." Fides Publishers Ass'n v. United
States, 263 F. Supp. 924, 935 (N.D. Ind. 1967)

IRS Standards for Journalism
✤

Revenue Ruling 67-4: Commercial Practices
✤

Why does revenue model have anything to do with educational nature of content?
✤

✤

✤

Thursday, June 14, 12

To IRS, commercial practices suggest profit motive as opposed to educational intent

Analysis generally boils down to:
✤

(a) whether the organization is using traditionally commercial models for generating
revenue (such as advertising and subscriptions); and

✤

(b) the profitability of the organization.

More on this later

IRS Standards for Journalism
✤

Revenue Ruling 77-4: The Four-Part Test in Action
✤

“The organization is a nonprofit corporation the only activity of which is the publication
and distribution of a weekly newspaper that presents local, national, and world news. The
pages of the newspaper are equally divided between community interest items of
significance to the members of a certain ethnic group, national and international news
articles of special interest to the members of the group, and regular commercial advertising.
It also republishes syndicated editorials. The newspaper operates with a paid staff. The staff
has no special skills and abilities other than those that are generally found on the staff of any
other newspaper.”

✤

“This organization's only activities are preparing and publishing a newspaper, soliciting
advertising, and selling subscriptions to that newspaper in a manner indistinguishable from
ordinary commercial publishing practices. Accordingly, it is not operated exclusively for
charitable and educational purposes.”

Thursday, June 14, 12

IRS Standards for Journalism
✤

Revenue Procedure 86-43: Distinguishing Advocacy
✤

1959 Treasury Regulations echo concerns regarding perceived NET bias
✤

✤

Treasury regs held unconstitutional in 1980
✤

Thursday, June 14, 12

“An organization may be educational even though it advocates a particular position or
viewpoint so long as it presents a sufficiently full and fair exposition of the pertinent
facts as to permit an individual or the public to form an independent opinion or
conclusion. On the other hand, an organization is not educational if its principal function
is the mere presentation of unsupported opinion.”

Gave IRS too much discretion to discriminate on basis of viewpoint

IRS Standards for Journalism
✤

Revenue Procedure 86-43: Distinguishing Advocacy
✤

Without the Treasury Regulations to rely upon, IRS followed its own “methodology” test,
which focuses more on the method of presentation than the content

✤

Codified in 1986 as Revenue Procedure 86-43

Thursday, June 14, 12

IRS Standards for Journalism
✤

Revenue Procedure 86-43: Distinguishing Advocacy
✤

Thursday, June 14, 12

“The presence of any of the following factors in the presentations made by an organization is indicative that
the method used by the organization to advocate its viewpoints or positions is not educational:
✤

“The presentation of viewpoints or positions unsupported by facts is a significant portion of the
organization's communications.

✤

“The facts that purport to support the viewpoints or positions are distorted.

✤

“The organization's presentations make substantial use of inflammatory and disparaging terms and
express conclusions more on the basis of strong emotional feelings than of objective evaluations.

✤

“The approach used in the organization's presentations is not aimed at developing an understanding on
the part of the intended audience or readership because it does not consider their background or
training in the subject matter.”

IRS Standards for Journalism
✤

Revenue Procedure 86-43: Distinguishing Advocacy
✤

Thursday, June 14, 12

“There may be exceptional circumstances, however, where an organization's advocacy may be educational
even if one of more of the factors listed in section 3.03 are present. The Service will look to all the facts and
circumstances to determine whether an organization may be considered educational despite the presence of
one or more of such factors.”

Designing a Tax Exempt News Organization
✤

Developing a plan for content
✤

Consider the knowledge and educational level of your audience, and gear content
appropriately

✤

Explain and analyze information, don’t merely report it

✤

Primary focus should be on what the audience needs to know, rather than what “sells
papers”
✤

✤

Thursday, June 14, 12

Some degree of “non-educational” content might be permissible (spoonful of sugar)

Investigative and data-based journalism tend to fare better than current events reporting

Designing a Tax Exempt News Organization
✤

Building your team
✤

✤

Thursday, June 14, 12

Find people who will help demonstrate that your organization is educational
✤

Consider involving academics and researchers, in addition to news professionals

✤

Look for board members with significant experience (“experts in the relevant field”)

✤

Look for content contributors with teachable knowledge (“leading authors, journalists,
professors and educators”)

Can be more difficult for a general news organization than a field-specific organization

Designing a Tax Exempt News Organization
✤

Organization as a formal entity
✤

Need to form as a nonprofit organization (or certain other limited forms) under the laws of a
particular state - see http://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/forming-nonprofit-corporation

✤

Articles of organization and bylaws need to meet specific requirements
✤

Need to state that your purpose is one of the eight 501(c)(3) purposes
✤

Thursday, June 14, 12

Not “journalism” -- to the IRS, journalism is the method, not the purpose

✤

Cannot grant organization powers to conduct business that conflicts with that purpose

✤

Must state that upon dissolution the nonprofit’s assets go to another nonprofit

Designing a Tax Exempt News Organization
✤

Next step is to apply for Section 501(c)(3) status using IRS Form 1023
✤

Specific line-by-line guidance is beyond scope of this talk
✤

More information at http://www.dmlp.org/application-501c3-tax-exemption and
http://www.irs.gov

✤

If you choose to apply for 501(c)(3) tax exemptions yourself, set aside an entire day to
devote to the form; the IRS says it takes ten hours for the average person to complete.

✤

Advice of tax counsel can be very useful

Thursday, June 14, 12

Designing a Tax Exempt News Organization
✤

You do not have to apply for federal tax exemption if the organization's gross (not net) receipts
are “normally less than $5,000 per taxable year.”
✤

✤

Thursday, June 14, 12

The IRS states that a nonprofit organization does not normally have more than $5,000
annually in gross receipts if it had a total of:
✤

$7,500 or less in gross receipts, during its first tax year

✤

$12,000 or less in gross receipts, during its first 2 tax years

✤

$15,000 or less in gross receipts, during its first 3 tax years

Note that if your nonprofit corporation brings in more than the $5,000 threshold, it must file
Form 1023 within 90 days of the end of the year

After You Apply: The Waiting Game
✤

On average, the IRS takes 6-8 months to rule on Section 501(c)(3) status

✤

But in the journalism context, some organizations in the process have been waiting 2+ years
✤

Not clear why
✤

✤

Thursday, June 14, 12

Likely caused by uptick in applications by news outlets at same time that IRS is
reviewing its existing precedents for the Internet era

Some movement lately (especially for investigative journalism centers), but others have
received significant push-back from the agency or simply heard nothing at all

After You Apply: The Waiting Game
✤

Raises significant questions:
✤

How do you stay afloat when your ability to receive donations is in limbo?

✤

Is there any way to speed things up?

Thursday, June 14, 12

After You Apply: The Waiting Game
✤

First: Don’t stop trying to raise funds
✤

Some funders or private donors might be willing to support you without a tax deduction

✤

Some funders might enter into contingent agreements

✤

Thursday, June 14, 12

✤

Helps show an intent to operate as a nonprofit

✤

Can be the basis for expedited consideration by the IRS

Failure, if documented, can show the IRS why you need to rely on alternative revenue

After You Apply: The Waiting Game
✤

Second: Turn to commercial sources of revenue to supplement traditional nonprofit funding
✤

No strict rule against advertising and sales, but be careful
✤

✤

Can offset implication of commercial intent by attempting fundraising first
✤

Thursday, June 14, 12

“While the sale of advertising space will not automatically disqualify a journal from taxexempt status ..., the absence of advertisements in the bulletin underscores petitioner's
lack of commercial intent.” Peoples Translation Serv. v. Comm’r, 72 T.C. 42, 50 (1979).

“Apparently, the only way petitioner could accomplish its objective ... was by selling
Pulpit Resource at a price sufficient to pay for its cost and provide [its founder] with a
reasonable salary. It ... received few, if any, contributions and a contest for best sermons
met with little financial success.” Pulpit Resource v. Comm'r, 70 T.C. 594, 610 (1978).

After You Apply: The Waiting Game
✤

Second: Turn to commercial sources of revenue to supplement traditional nonprofit funding
✤

Helps if advertising is necessary because of special costs related to educational mission, or is
guided by the educational mission
✤

Thursday, June 14, 12

“[The magazine]'s expenses include costs which a commercially oriented magazine
would never have. The best example is the expense incurred in conducting its frequent
reader participation surveys, tabulating the results, analysis of results, and the expense of
notification of readers who are at particularly high risk with regard to a specific disease
or condition. ... [The publisher] does not advertise its magazine. It does accept
commercial advertising, but does not accept the advertisements of products that it
considers to be medically harmful. Consequently, it receives no revenue from the two
most lucrative sources of advertising income - tobacco and alcohol advertising.” I.R.S.
Tech. Adv. Mem. 87-51-007 (September 14, 1987).

After You Apply: The Waiting Game
✤

Third: Don’t try to earn a profit
✤

Keeping pricing below cost is better, if you have some funding to make up the difference
✤

✤

If you accidentally generate a profit, put it to charitable use
✤

Thursday, June 14, 12

“Although the organization receives substantial income from the sale of subscriptions
and advertising space, such revenue does not cover its costs of operations. It must
depend upon contributions to make up the difference.” Rev. Rul. 68-306.

Presbyterian and Reformed Publ'g Co. v. Comm’r, 743 F.2d 148, 157-59 (3rd Cir. 1984) (where
non-profit organization had historically required donations, sudden profits due to
unanticipated demand for books published by organization was acceptable, where
accumulated profits would be used to expand tax exempt activities).

After You Apply: The Waiting Game
✤

These rules apply even after you receive tax-exempt status
✤

✤

The IRS can audit your operations to see if your financial activity reflects a profit motive as
opposed to an educational purpose

Can be much more difficult to pass IRS scrutiny on these points if you are directly competing
with other commercial news outlets
✤

IRS is wary of publishing and news organizations that seek a tax exemption merely to
survive in a competitive marketplace

✤

More likely to succeed if you are filling a specific information gap (topically or
geographically)

Thursday, June 14, 12

After You Apply: The Waiting Game
✤

Speeding things up
✤

✤

The IRS is remarkably resistant to outside pressure to move quickly on an issue
✤

Unless you’re a member of Congress, bugging them probably won’t work

✤

Especially where they have decided there is a special issue they need to work through

There are two procedures that exist for obtaining a decision more quickly (but neither are
guaranteed to work)
✤

Thursday, June 14, 12

Advisable to consult with an attorney before attempting these

After You Apply: The Waiting Game
✤

Speeding things up: Request for Expedited Processing
✤

“We will only approve expedited processing of an application where a request is made in
writing and contains a compelling reason for processing the application ahead of others.
Circumstances generally warranting expedited processing include:
✤

“A grant to the applicant is pending and the failure to secure the grant may have an
adverse impact on the organization's ability to continue operations.

✤

“The purpose of the newly created organization is to provide disaster relief to victims of
emergencies such as flood and hurricane.

✤

“There have been undue delays in issuing a letter caused by problems within the IRS.”
✤

Thursday, June 14, 12

The IRS taking its time is unlikely to be seen as a “problem”

After You Apply: The Waiting Game
✤

Speeding things up: Declaratory Judgment Action
✤

Thursday, June 14, 12

26 U.S.C. § 7428
✤

(a) “In a case of actual controversy involving ... a failure by the Secretary [of the Treasury]
to make a determination with respect to [tax-exempt status] ... upon the filing of an
appropriate pleading, the United States Tax Court, the United States Court of Federal
Claims, or the district court of the United States for the District of Columbia may make a
declaration with respect to such initial qualification[.]”

✤

(b)(2) “An organization ... shall be deemed to have exhausted its administrative
remedies ... at the expiration of 270 days after the date on which the request for such
determination was made if the organization has taken, in a timely manner, all reasonable
steps to secure such determination.”

What Can You Do With a Tax Exemption?
✤

If you receive your tax exemption, you’re not free and clear of the IRS
✤

Subject to restrictions on your operations
✤

✤

Standards for educational content and revenue generation still apply

✤

Substantial reporting requirements exist, which can be burdensome

✤

Subject to IRS audit for compliance with the above, and revocation of tax exemption for
non-compliance

Nevertheless, there are many things that you can do

Thursday, June 14, 12

What Can You Do With a Tax Exemption?
✤

✤

Original reporting, especially:
✤

Investigative reporting

✤

Data-based journalism and research

✤

Media watchdog journalism

News aggregation is less likely to be “educational,” unless you are adding your own analysis
and educational commentary

Thursday, June 14, 12

What Can You Do With a Tax Exemption?
✤

Political analysis
✤

Completely barred from supporting or opposing particular candidates for election (any
election)
✤

No traditional newspaper-style endorsements allowed

✤

HOWEVER, under Treasury Department regulations, “engaging in nonpartisan analysis,
study, or research and making the results thereof available to the public” will not disqualify
an organization from an exemption

✤

BUT analysis of particular candidates for election might be deemed to be partisan if it inures
to the benefit or detriment of a particular candidate, even if the analysis is neutral in tone
and does not consider formal party affiliation

Thursday, June 14, 12

What Can You Do With a Tax Exemption?
✤

Training of journalists and the community
✤

Many nonprofit news organizations are affiliated with universities or journalism schools

✤

Others run training programs or lecture series as part of their standard operations

✤

Teaching activities demonstrate an educational purpose

Thursday, June 14, 12

What Can You Do With a Tax Exemption?
✤

“Insubstantial” lobbying
✤

Lobbying related to legislation as opposed to support for political candidates

✤

Tax exempt organizations are barred from engaging in “substantial” lobbying activity, but
are permitted to engage in an insubstantial amount of lobbying activity that does not support
a particular candidate

✤

IRS will apply one of two tests to determine whether lobbying is “substantial”

Thursday, June 14, 12

✤

“Substantial Part Test”: default

✤

“Expenditure Test”: elected by taxpayer by filing IRS Form 5768

What Can You Do With a Tax Exemption?
✤

Partner with for-profit organizations to distribute content and achieve other goals
✤

“A § 501(c)(3) organization may form and participate in a partnership and meet the
operational test if 1) participation in the partnership furthers a charitable purpose, and 2)
the partnership arrangement permits the exempt organization to act exclusively in
furtherance of its exempt purpose and only incidentally for the benefit of the for-profit
partners.” Rev. Rul. 2004-51.

✤

Control of content/educational mission needs to remain with the nonprofit

✤

Can run into problems where operations of the for-profit and nonprofit become blurred

Thursday, June 14, 12

What Can You Do With a Tax Exemption?
✤

Pay a reasonable wage to yourself and your employees
✤

Limited only by requirement that “no part of the net earnings of [the nonprofit] inure[] to
the benefit of any private shareholder or individual”

✤

Should be fine so long as salaries/pay rates are comparable to market rates

✤

No requirement that nonprofits pay below market rates; low non-profit salaries normally
driven by budget constraints

Thursday, June 14, 12

Legal Resources
✤

As discussed, many points in this process where legal counsel can be useful
✤

✤

Drafting organizational documents and Form 1023, interacting with the IRS

Access to legal counsel just as important for nonprofit newsrooms as for-profit
✤

Pre-publication review

✤

Trademark and intellectual property rights (nonprofits can hold IP rights)
