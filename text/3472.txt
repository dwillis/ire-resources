Bad news: Spammers!

Worker ATAMRO447HWJQ
labeled X (porn) sites as G (general audience)

Improve Data Quality through Repeated Labeling
 Get multiple, redundant labels using multiple workers
 Pick the correct label based on majority vote

11 workers
93% correct

1 worker
70% correct

 Probability of correctness increases with number of workers
 Probability of correctness increases with quality of workers

Using redundant votes, we can infer worker quality
 Look at our spammer friend ATAMRO447HWJQ
together with other 9 workers

 We can compute error rates for each worker
Error rates for ATAMRO447HWJQ



P[X → X]=0.847%
P[G → X]=0.053%

Our “friend” ATAMRO447HWJQ
P[X → G]=99.153%
mainly marked sites as G.
Obviously a spammer…
P[G → G]=99.947%

Rejecting spammers and Benefits
Random answers error rate = 50%
Average error rate for ATAMRO447HWJQ: 49.6%



P[X → X]=0.847%
P[G → X]=0.053%

P[X → G]=99.153%
P[G → G]=99.947%

Action: REJECT and BLOCK

Results:
 Over time you block all spammers
 Spammers learn to avoid your HITS
 You can decrease redundancy, as quality of workers is higher

Correcting biases
 Classifying sites as G, PG, R, X
 Sometimes workers are careful but biased
Error Rates for CEO of company detecting offensive content (and parent)

P[X → G]=0.0%

P[X → P]=0.0%

P[G → R]=0.0%

We simply need to “reverse the errors” (technical details omitted)
and separate error from bias



True error-rate ~ 9%

Too much theory?
Demo and Open source implementation available at:

http://qmturk.appspot.com
 Input:
– Labels from Mechanical Turk
– Some “gold” data (optional)
– Cost of incorrect labelings (e.g., XÆG costlier than GÆX)
 Output:
– Corrected labels
– Worker error rates
– Ranking of workers according to their quality

How to handle free-form answers?
 Q: “My task does not have discrete answers….”
 A: Break into two HITs:
– “Create” HIT
Creation HIT
– “Vote” HIT
(e.g. transcribe caption)

Voting HIT:
Correct or not?

 Vote HIT controls quality of Creation HIT
 Redundancy controls quality of Voting HIT
 Catch: If “creation” very good, in voting workers just vote “yes”
– Solution: Add some random noise (e.g. misspell)
©2011 - Duplication prohibited without permission from Investigative Reporters and Editors, Inc.

Example: Collect URLs

But my free-form is
not just right or wrong…

Describe this

 “Create” HIT
 “Improve” HIT
 “Compare” HIT
Creation HIT
(e.g. describe the image)

Improve HIT

Compare HIT (voting)

(e.g. improve description)

Which is better?

version 1:

A parial view of a pocket calculator together with
some coins and a pen.
version 2:
A view of personal items a calculator, and some gold and
copper coins, and a round tip pen, these are all pocket
and wallet sized item used for business, writting, calculating
prices or solving math problems and purchasing items.
version 3:
A close-up photograph of the following items: A CASIO multifunction calculator. A ball point pen, uncapped. Various coins,
apparently European, both copper and gold. Seems to be a
theme illustration for a brochure or document cover treating
finance, probably personal finance.
version 4:
…Various British coins; two of £1 value, three of 20p value and
one of 1p value. …

version 8:

“A close-up photograph of the following items: A
CASIO multi-function, solar powered scientific
calculator. A blue ball point pen with a blue rubber
grip and the tip extended. Six British coins; two of £1
value, three of 20p value and one of 1p value. Seems
to be a theme illustration for a brochure or document
cover treating finance - probably personal finance."

Future: Break big task to simple ones and build workflow
 Running experiment: Crowdsource big tasks (e.g., tourist guide)
My Boss is a Robot (mybossisarobot.com)
Nikki Kittur (Carnegie Mellon) + Jim Giles (New Scientist)
– Identify sights worth checking out (one tip per worker)
• Vote and rank
– Brief tips for each monument (one tip per worker)
• Vote and rank
– Aggregate tips in meaningful summary
• Iterate to improve…
