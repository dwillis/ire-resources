Check registers
·
Each local government that writes its own checks/processes its own payroll/receives tax dollars and pays
its vendors/suppliers/contractors/employees has a checking account of some kind. Otherwise, they couldn’t pay
anyone.
·
Some local governments have their check registers online already.
Vendor & contractor data
Local governments have to have some way to keep organized all the firms that they do business with ­­ the
stores that sell them office supplies, the heavy equipment dealers who sell them bulldozers and road scrapers,
the company that comes around the refills the Coke machine at City Hall.
Voters
Your state likely has a database of registered voters. The ease with which you can access this data through a
freedom of information request will vary from state to state. Some states have stopped giving out certain pieces
of information, such as voter date of birth, due to concerns about identity fraud.
Example: Georgia’s data comes in two parts, the list of registered voters and the voter history file. You can’t tell
what election(s) a voter voted in without the history file, and you can’t do much with the history file without
having the list of registered voters. The history file is online and downloadable for free (each voter is represented
by an ID number, no names), while the list of registered voters will set you back $250 and you have to get the
state to send it to you.
Licensed professions
Your state likely requires people in certain professions to get licenses from the state. Different states require
licenses for different jobs, but here are some examples: Contractors, architects, cosmetologists, security guards,
private detectives, barbers, professional sports agents, mixed martial arts bout promoters, geologists,
nutritionists, to name a few.
Property taxes
Property tax data tells you who owns a given piece of property, information about the property and how much it’s
supposedly worth.
Note: It can also be interesting to see who hasn’t paid their taxes, and for how far back. This may not be
included in the property tax data set, and you may have to ask for it separately.
Some other ideas:
● Hunting and fishing licenses
● Boat registrations
● Boating accidents
● Inspections of all kinds, for anything that is inspected ­­ restaurant health inspection scores,
publicly used swimming pools, tattoo parlors, school bus safety records
● Death certificate data
● Lottery winners
● Commissioned law enforcement officers (these will be commissioned by your state, probably)
● Jail booking lists
● Prison inmate data
● Parolees and probationers
● Teacher certification data from your state
