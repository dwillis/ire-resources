Building A Data-Driven Enterprise Machine

Being relevant. It’s one of the fundamental challenges facing
newspapers today, and it’s one of the big issues if you’re the CAR
specialist in the newsroom.
In my experience, devoting yourself to a handful of giant projects is
not the golden path. In my decade as a database editor, I’ve found
that it’s better strategy to touch the newsroom in as many ways as
possible, as often as possible.
There will always be big projects – but having an overall positive
impact on the paper will make you invaluable.
My approach is to identify key coverage areas for the paper and
become master of any and all related data. This serves several
purposes:
 You have data on-hand for when something comes up, and you
have it in a format that is ready to use
 You have valuable info to post on your intranet for other
reporters to use, and perhaps, for your online readers too.
 You have a steady source of enterprise opportunities on subjects
that matter a lot to your paper.
 You have baseline data that can be joined into other projects.
These are the bread-and-butter databases that I would advise you to
become a regular consumer of – adjust accordingly based on your own
circumstances:
Property ownership/tax records
Land sales
Crime – both UCR-info and incident reports
Campaign finance records
Corporate records
Voter registration
Deaths
Payrolls
Demographics
School enrollment by gender, race, poverty status
GIS files – mapping is as important an analytical tool to me as
Access and Excel

Of course, having databases and having it ready to use are two
different matters. I have a number of standard practices that I apply
to prepping my data:
 Geography standardization: If you do a lot of analysis involving
towns, counties or school districts, make sure you have a singleset of unique ID codes for these entities. I standardize
everything using Census FIPS codes, even though various New
Jersey agencies have their own coding systems.
 Name standardization: It would be a good practice to always
break name fields into at least last name and first name. If you
do this as you process new data, it will be much easier later to
do joins on deadline.
 Indexing: One way to make your life a lot easier, and quicker, is
to index all search fields and all join fields.
 Geocoding: Increasingly, I find myself geocoding certain
datasets on a regular basis. I do this primarily so I can post data
on the Web via the Google maps api, but also as an analytical
tool – once you have addresses converted to lat/long and plotted
on a map, you can “join” the data spatially. For example, if you
have a crime database, you can join the addresses to Census
tracts with mapping software and calculate local neighborhood
crime rates.
Some “Beat Stories” that resulted from using these techniques at the
Star-Ledger:

Every year, we gather oodles of data on property taxes in New Jersey
and mine it for news. In this case, we took a database of more than 3
million individual home assessments and married it to new tax rate
info compiled from 21 different county clerks – we are usually weeks
or months ahead of the “official” release of tax info by government
regulators.

Likewise, we regularly collect land sale data for all 566 municipalities
in the state. Our home sales analysis is always more precise and local
than anything put out by the Realtors.

This is a routine Census release that we mined for enterprise by asking
the right questions. We knew that the mostly immigrant Mexican
population in New Jersey was going to be among the poorest ethnic
groups – but we then compared the relationship between Mexicans
and non-Mexicans in New Jersey with other states and found that the
income gap in our state was the largest in the nation.
This brings me to a final point – despite what your editor believes,
your computer isn’t magic. To get the most enterprise out of data, you
have to apply the same skills that make you a good reporter. You have
to have creative ideas first, and then use CAR skills to turn the ideas
into reality.
It’s a lot easier when you have an arsenal of relevant and clean data
as your base.
