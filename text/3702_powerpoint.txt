Finding the holes in economic
impact studies
Daniel Connolly, The Commercial Appeal
Memphis, Tenn.

Special thanks to Sarah Cohen of
Duke University.

Questions to ask
• Who paid for the study?
• What is the reputation of the person or group
that did the study?

Questions about multipliers
• What multipliers did they use and where did
they come from?

Example: A factory will create 1,000 jobs.
1,000 jobs times a multiplier of 2 = 2,000 jobs.
Compare the multipliers in the study to those
from the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

More questions to ask
• What numbers are based on assumptions?

• How much money would you predict people
would spend on alcohol while visiting the
Super Bowl?
The consultant said $116 per capita.

Put it in perspective
• How does the economic impact compare to the
size of the local economy?
