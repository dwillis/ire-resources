BEFORE THE INTERVIEW

CONVINCE SUBJECT TO TALK
Experts always want to teach
People who’ve been hurt:
Opportunity to help other people
Honor your loved one
Government/Elected officials
There will be an interview—scheduled or unscheduled
PIO’s are not elected, they are communications experts but not where the buck stops

PREPARE
Write & practice questions
Remember the object of the interview—3 main points
Treat interview like a story---should ebb and flow
One question at a time—don’t ask the double ended question
Open ended questions for some things—but a simple y/n can be impactful
Avoid loaded words (liar)
Do your homework
Use their words against them (prior interviews, emails, memos)
Anticipate the PR response

DURING THE INTERVIEW
Have documents in order, don’t want to rifle through them
Listen Listen Listen
Keep asking questions they don’t answer
Don’t be the expert!! Let THEM talk
Stay calm
Don’t be afraid of silence

AFTER THE INTERVIEW
Watch the interview right away
Fact check what they said
Get response to what they’ve said
