WE

CANADALAND

CANADALAND’S
INVESTIGATION
Published: October 15, 2018
Nut Graph:
“A CANADALAND investigation reveals that WE is connected
to no fewer than three companies known to use child and
slave labour in their supply chain. In fact, WE logos can be
found promoting products made in part by children, including
Hershey’s products that contain cocoa farmed by child
labourers in West African countries, and Kellogg’s products
that contain palm oil farmed by child labourers in Indonesia.
WE also has a large partnership with Unilever, which has been
a major purchaser of palm oil produced with child labour.”

THE STAKES…
We Charity and its “social enterprise” Me To We are massive
global players with hundreds of multi-national partners that
have associated themselves with the Kielburger’s sterling
international brand and mission of eradicating child labour.
Stats:
• More than 1,000 employees.
• An affiliation with 16,000 schools and groups globally,
delivering both extracurricular programming and actual school
lessons
• This past year, 200,000 students attended a WE Day event.
Speakers have included the Dalai Lama, Malala Yousafzai,
Prince Harry, Justin Trudeau, and Jennifer Aniston. WE Days
are broadcast on network TV in Canada and the U.S.

THE RESPONSE
Three weeks prior to publication, Canadaland put written
questions to We.
“We (Charity) responded with 32 questions of their own,
asking us why we were asking the questions we asked,
how many of their employees we had spoken to, and how
did we know that their former employees were credible?...”
“They told us we would need to answer their questions before
they would answer ours.”

PRE-PUBLICATION
LAWYER LETTER
Peter A. Downard of Fasken Martineau DuMoulin wrote to Canadaland on
behalf of We, admonishing that, “responsible journalism is not a poker game in
which cards are held close to the chest,” with reference to his feeling that
CANADALAND failed to provide enough detail about the nature of our
investigation.”
“Mr. Kerr’s communications with [WE] clearly demonstrate a readiness to rely
on sources of information who may obviously have a bias or ‘axe to grind,’ in a
manner that is completely inconsistent with appropriate standards of
verification.”
“There should be no doubt that in this case the damage would be
enormous…The disregard of adequate principles of verification and the
inappropriate use of biased and anonymous sources would drive a very large
award of general, aggravated, special, and very possibly, punitive damages.”

THE ANSWERS AND
AFTERMATH
Eventually, the charity
provided more than 100
pages of material in
response.
Canadaland published
the entire response
online. No interview was
granted.
We Charity later sent two
libel notices for the
original story and a
follow-up.

POST-PUBLICATION
In a move no one has
ever seen before, We
Charity hired former
Justice Stephen
Goudge to write a
third-party report
analyzing the story
and the materials We
Charity provided to
Canadaland.

KEY FINDING: VETTING
PARTNERS FOR CHILD
LABOUR
CANADALAND

“To one crucial question —
do they refuse to partner
with companies whose
products are made in part
by children — WE has
offered no denial.

WE

“You have maligned the excellent
reputations of our clients with
accusations that they have lied to
the public regarding their
commitment to ending child and
slave labour, and that they tolerate,
secretly consent to and promote
the use of child labour by WE's
corporate partners, when ample
evidence was provided to you
demonstrating the contrary.”

GOUDGE
CONCLUSION
“WE describes an
extensive vetting
process in which
prospective partners
are assessed through
five “lenses”…
It is neither accurate
nor fair to say that WE
has no process for
vetting its corporate
partnerships.”

KEY FINDING: PARTNERING
WITH UNILEVER
CANADALAND

As of 2016, Unilever was
using palm oil produced by
Indonesian child workers in its
products, according to a report
by Amnesty
International…Unilever is
listed as a “founding partner”
on the WE Charity website.

WE

“Your defamatory statement that
WE is secretly indifferent to the
use of child labour by Unilever
is completely false and
malicious… The focus of WE's
relationship with Unilever is not
the tolerance and continuance
of child labour, but its complete
elimination from any Unilever
supply chain.”

GOUDGE
CONCLUSION:
“Given WE’s vetting
process before entering
into the partnership with
Unilever, as well as WE’s
work with Unilever to
eliminate child labour in
Unilever’s supply chain, I
conclude that it is not fair or
accurate to say that WE
tolerates or secretly
consents to child labour by
its partner Unilever.”

KEY FINDING:
PARTNERING WITH
KELLOGG’S
CANADALAND

“Amnesty International found
Kellogg’s to be using palm
oil sourced from child labour.
A former WE employee sent
CANADALAND images of
“ME to WE”-branded boxes
of Special K and Frosted
Mini-Wheats.

WE

“You prominently displayed in the
article, and circulated on social
media, a seemingly authentic
image of a Kellogg's cereal box
with the ME to WE logo. This
mock-up was not a depiction of an
authentic product. You were
informed of this fact on multiple
occasions prior to publication. You
nevertheless maliciously used the
mock-up as a 'smoking gun' to
prove a non-existent partnership
between ME to WE and Kellogg’s.

GOUDGE ON
KELLOGG’S
“In light of WE’s
response that none of its
entities have any
partnerships with
Kellogg’s, I conclude
there is no merit to the
allegation that WE
tolerates or secretly
consents to child labour
practices by its
corporate partner,
Kellogg’s.

KEY FINDING: HERSHEY
PARTNERSHIP
CANADALAND

“The Hershey Company…uses
cocoa reaped by child slaves
in Ghana and the Ivory Coast.
Child slaves are sometimes
beaten for not working quickly
enough. Hershey’s has been
sued multiple times for not
disclosing its use of child
labour to consumers.

WE

“Although you were informed in detail
prior to publication of the thorough
and robust procedures WE has in
place to ensure that WE only works
with corporations committed to
building socially-responsible supply
chains. You omitted numerous key
facts and evidence to the contrary
which again did not fit your
narrative.”

GOUDGE ON
HERSHEY’S
“WE Charity was satisfied
that Hershey’s was working
seriously to eradicate child
labour in its supply chain.
“As a result, I conclude that
it is not fair or accurate to
say that WE Charity
tolerates or secretly
consents to the use of child
labour by its corporate
partner, Hershey’s.
