TIP SHEET FOR INVESTIGATING LOCAL GOVERNMENT

1.

GOOD LOCAL GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS SHOULD:
-APPEAL TO A WIDE AUDIENCE
-HOLD ACCOUNTABLE THE RESPONSIBLE OFFICIALS OR LEADERS
-PROVIDE PERSPECTIVE

2.

APPEAL TO A WIDE AUDIENCE BY INVESTIGATING HOW OFFICIALS ARE SPENDING
TAX MONEY, AND THE PRIORITIES OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

3.

HOLD ACCOUNTABLE RESPONSIBLE ELECTED OR MANAGERS WHETHER OR NOT
THEY TALK TO YOU, ON CAMERA OR OFF.

4.

PROVIDE PERSPECTIVE BY:

- COMPARING AND CONTRASTING THE SPENDING AND POLICIES AND
PRACTICES OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT YOU’RE INVESTIGATING WITH THOSE OF
OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THIS ALSO HELPS BROADEN THE APPEAL OF YOUR
STORY.
-INTERVIEWING AN EXPERT SUCH AS A STATE AUDITOR
-RELYING ON COMMENTS AND CRITIQUES THAT APPEAR IN PUBLISHED STATE
AUDITS OF YOUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT, OBTAINED THROUGH OPEN RECORDS LAWS.
5.

INVESTIGATE SPENDING & PRIORITIES. VIEWERS LOVE IT AND IT’S A PUBLIC
SERVICE.

6.

PLAN FOR POSSIBLE FOLLOW UP STORIES TO YOUR INVESTIGATION AND REPORT
THOSE STORIES YOURSELF.

-MIX DAILY GENERAL ASSIGNMENT STORIES WITH INVESTIGATIVE STORIES.
-INVESTIGATING & REPORTING SOLUTIONS CREATES FOLLOW UP STORIES.
7.

GET THE DOCUMENTS. THIS IS WHAT SETS YOU APART FROM GENERAL
ASSIGNMENT REPORTERS, WHO OFTEN DON’T HAVE TIME TO GET ALL THE
RECORDS. YOU DO. YOU’LL DISCOVER MANY WONDERFUL THINGS IN THE
DOCUMENTS WHICH ADD DEPTH TO YOUR STORY.
-DON’T OVERUSE DOCUMENTS IN A TV STORY. CHOOSE NUGGETS.
-CREATE GRAPHICS THAT WILL RESONATE WITH VIEWERS,
