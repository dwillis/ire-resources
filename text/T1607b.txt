Investigative Reporting
at
The Orange County Register

A NEW MODEL

How this plan evolved
A newsroom committee met all-day Sept. 28, 2000 to
discuss investigative reporting.
ü The group worked to define enterprise, project and
investigative reporting.
ü The group analyzed examples of work in the past
two years.
ü Five models were discussed to strengthen our
investigative reporting at the Register. A proposal
was drafted.
ü A second group convened Oct. 3 to refine the
proposal.

mine for stories.
üThe Investigative Editor and reporters will mentor and
train other staff.

standards.

Manages resources within the neighborhood and leads the collaboration
on stories. Partners with the Investigative Editor in hiring and reviewing

SCARCE RESOURCES: Photographers, Artists, designers, copy editors
and web resources need to be active participants early in the process.
