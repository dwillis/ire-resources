Tips for Parking
 Ask for all the parking databases available,
including residential parking permits, tickets,
handicapped parking spaces/permits for
individual residents, complaint data, appeals
logs..etc.
 Request all the reports, studies done on
parking. Boston didn’t even know how many
spaces there were in the city.

Government Boards

Questions about boards?
 How many boards?
 How many vacancies? Holdovers?
 Who serves on boards? Are they diverse?
Are they paid?
 Do all the boards still meet?
 Are there boards meeting with too few
members present or many cancellations?
 Do all the boards file required annual
reports, meeting minutes…etc.
