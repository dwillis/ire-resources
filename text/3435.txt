Source development
a. My mindset
i. HUMBLE – The health care reform debate in Congress proved that
health care is multifaceted, multi-layered, looks different
depending on your perspective and is virtually impossible for one
person to understand. We can claim to know relatively little about
health care.
ii. TEACHABLE – sources are the experts. They educate me and lead
me in the right direction.
iii. LONG-TERM INVESTMENT – Have coffee or lunch with
sources off-deadline. Ask them to help you understand the health
care system. Ask them what they consider to be the most important
issues in the community. When you write, be accurate, fair and
don’t sensationalize anything – the sources will see right through
it. Your success is all about your reputation in the medical
community.
b. A variety of stakeholders
i. There is no health care “system” – it’s really a collection of
powerful individual stakeholders who work together to provide
health care services.
1. Doctors, nurses, insurance companies, hospitals,
pharmaceutical companies.
a. They are all intelligent, well informed and
motivated to talk. Just be aware they come from a
special interest point of view.
b. Remember the Mindset we talked about above.
ii. My “special interest” – patient care. The one person with no
voice/power/influence in the health care system is the patient.
The investment pays off in story tips
a. Patient privacy leak at University Medical Center, our local public
hospital
i. Source calls – Someone at UMC is leaking private information
about car accident victims to personal injury attorneys. The
hospital administrators and county commissioners are not being
aggressive in stopping it.
ii. How do I verify that? The source provides me 21 actual UMC face
sheets – registration papers that provide all the personal info about

each patient. Clearly there’s a leak that violates HIPAA, the federal
privacy act.
iii. Call the county commissioners and hospital CEO, asking about
rumors of leak without revealing I have the face sheets. They
downplay the possibility of a leak, until I reveal I have the face
sheets.
iv. The story ran:

Hospital regulation
a. The Nevada State Health Division licenses hospitals in Nevada. There’s a
similar agency in every state. They investigate complaints. Act on behalf
of consumers. Transparent. Their investigative reports are posted here:
http://www.health.nv.gov/Deficiencies_Qry.asp
i. Their investigation of the privacy breach at UMC led to a
Statement of Deficincies:
http://health.nv.gov/Deficiencies/2009/12/2009-1212_sod_UMCOfSouthernNevada_state.pdf
1. Always ask for the investigator’s notes, which are a public
document that’s used to write the Statement of
Deficiencies. They often contain additional information.
ii. In April the FBI indicted man who allegedly paid off UMC
employees for information, which he uses to help attorneys file
personal injury lawsuits.
