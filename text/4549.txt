How we used this data buffet to
probe a urine drug testing boom
We learned through sources
that some people in
Medicare were increasingly
concerned about spending
on certain urine testing
procedures, in particular
tests for illicit drugs
administered by pain doctors
in their offices or affiliated
laboratories.

Where is Medicare spending growing?

Who’s driving up drug test spending?
The federal Medicare
agency released data
summarizing
payments to individual
doctors in 2014, after
legal efforts by the
Journal and other
media organizations.

Finding people familiar with the matter
Since 2011, Medicare
has published records
showing the number of
overlapping patients
between pairs of
doctors and other
providers.

Beyond just billing
Medicare releases claims level data that lets
researchers, companies, and—under some
circumstances—journalists track what actually
happens to patients.
--Hospital claims
--Skilled nursing facilities
--Home health services
--Hospice care
--Psychiatric stays
Some big limitations:
-- Can’t use it to identify patients
-- Must agree to certain restrictions
involving what we publish
-- Must agree to data practices
meant to protect patients.

How to get data or records that aren’t
publicly available?
CMS 2011 FOIA report:

The good news: Like other federal agencies, CMS delegates:
-- State survey agencies perform most inspects
-- Medciaid agencies administer that program
-- Web of regional contractors and sub contractors.
