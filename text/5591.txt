Think like a researcher
Internet creates a lot of noise — have a search
strategy
Look for experts, studies, datasets
Evaluate the source — is it current, reputable?

Stay organized

Use a checklist

Verify, verify, verify

As you search, log all the records
you find in a spreadsheet, noting
date, address, description, notes,
connections, source, link, etc. Print
electronic files to a pdf and keep in
a folder.

And background all sources - even
for features and sports. What
would you want to know about
each and every source?

Verify all information. Go to
primary source documents to cq
information found on the web or in
news accounts.

Search yourself

Expand your search

Think outside the box

Run your own name, friends
through websites to get an idea of
reliability.

Background relatives, business
associates. Talk to old neighbors,
teachers, etc.

Obituaries, marriage and divorce records
and other civil filings can be great places
to find relatives and property or personal
details. Voter registries typically include
birth dates and addresses.

When you’re searching

Use bits of information as keys to unlock new data (e.g., DOB)
If you have time, expand your search to family, business partners
Log dates/facts/sources/notes in a spreadsheet -- instant timeline!

Google better
The basics (h/t):
Full name (in and out of quotes) plus organization
Full name (in and out of quotes) and city/state
Last name and organization
Full name in quotes + “mugshot”
Always go a few pages in

Ghosts of internet past
Wayback Machine
WebsiteWatcher ($), Versionista, ChangeDetection
or FollowThatPage to track website revision

Similar Sites will pull a bunch of related sites

Scenario: Wayback Machine
I can visit the Columbia, MO regional airport site to
find passenger counts going back to 2002.
But, I need data going back to 2000.
I can find that with the Wayback Machine

But search engines typically miss:
Database information
Content behind firewalls
Content behind registration screens
ASP / dynamically generated pages
Robot.txt excluded pages

Speaking of databases...
Maybe your subject …
has been in trouble with the EPA: EPA ECHO
Has (legally) released toxic substances into the
environment: EPA Toxic Release Inventory
has a workplace inspected by OSHA: OSHA
inspections / OSHA plus
has been banned from contracting with the
federal government: Excluded parties

Speaking of databases
Maybe your subject …
has been the target of a consumer complaint:
CFPB consumer complaints
is a union or an officer in one: DOL union data
search
spilled something: Coast Guard National
Response Center
is a doctor: ProPublica Vital Signs

Speaking of databases...
Maybe your subject …
is a nonprofit or an officer in one:
Guidestar
ProPublica Nonprofit Explorer (now with name search!)
Here’s an annotated Form 990 with some things to look out for
is a nonprofit that has had its tax exemption revoked: IRS tax
exemption revocations
lobbies the government: OpenSecrets lobbyist search (cross-check

Run phone numbers, online handles, addresses
through social media sites, Craigslist

Social media: Twitter
Use the advanced search
Geotargeted tweet search => Search for a
radius around a pair of coordinates (only works
for users who enable location):
geocode:21.296939,-157.8193005,1mi
Quick way to grab latitude/longitude
coordinates for a place:
Go to maps.google.com and search for a

Save searches to check regularly

Social media: Twitter
Think like a tweeter. For human disasters (terrorist
attacks, shootings, explosions, war, conflict, train
collisions, etc.), try: explosion, terror, attack, horror,
OMG, OMGGGG, WTF, fuck, holy, shit, crash, shot,
shots, shooting, terrible, shocking, WOW, people, run,
running, someone, police, bus, car, plane, train, killed
Example: “wtf OR shit OR omg AND explosion OR
shooting”

The most important word to search

Social media: Twitter
Can you get all the tweets from one user? If the person has tweeted
3,200 times or fewer, sort of!

Twitter’s API restricts access to a user’s most recent 3,200 tweets.
AllMyTweets.com and similar sites will pull them up, though you still
have to scroll. Code solutions for scraping tweets also are restricted
by the API limits.
Some third-party tools like FollowersAnalysis offer to download a
user’s archives for a fee. (Haven’t tried!) If the user is cooperating
with your story, you could also ask them to download their personal
archive for you.
