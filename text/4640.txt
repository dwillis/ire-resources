Cannabis Reporting

Overview

Story Examples

Colorado was the first state to legalize recreational marijuana
and only 3 other states have, so far, followed suit: Oregon,
Washington and Alaska.
But even in this state, most jurisdictions do ​
not ​
allow retail
marijuana businesses to operate ­ and many don’t even allow
medical marijuana businesses to run. It’s also federally illegal,
no matter what state law says. So how can reporters tell the
stories about a growing industry ­ that operates in a legal gray
area?

Needs More Coverage
❖ MED Lacking Transparency
➢ The Denver Post ​
writes about a database that used to be easy to access, now
expensive and “not so easy”
❖ Civil Asset Forfeitures
➢ Even though marijuana is legal in the state, the feds could ­ at any time­ seize all
assets related to the distribution of a Schedule I substance. In some cases, they
have ­ monitor court records/federal filings to find out if this is a story worth
pursuing
❖ Medical Marijuana and Caregivers

➢ Caregivers are still largely unregulated, still operating in basements, still not
paying taxes (since they are not supposed to make a profit) still considered the
“gray market”
