Groundwork for success
 Internal:
 Read clips. Watch videos. Who is quoted?

 Download previous beat writer/editor
 Do your homework – what matters most?
 Align expectations with your boss.

 External: (Alpha dog effect)
 Out of sight, out of mind. Be visible.
 Produce stories, leverage social media.
 Respect culture & nuance.
 Name people.

Accuracy & Trust
• You are going to be back grounded.
• You must be right.

 Exacting standards.
 Your credibility.
 Your company.
 Your future.

Knowledge is Power
 Understand the beat / master the topic.
 Meet employees. Invest the time.
 Checks & balance of an agency/company:

unions, auditors, inspector general.
 “I don’t know” is ok. Ask for help.
 Worth reading back quotes?
 Power in documents, interviews. Silence is gold.

Rigor & Discernment
 Who is closest to the information? (Circle of

trust) – create a visual flow chart.
 Vet the sources & agendas.
 How do you know that?
 What is available via the public record?
 Who else knows? Who else on record.
 Churn. Never reject interview.
