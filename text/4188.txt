Investigating natural disasters

Before disaster strikes

Planning: Discuss or report on the likely disasters in your area -- earthquakes, landslides,
wildfire, flooding, pipeline failures, hurricanes, tornadoes, oil car derailments, tsunamis. You’re
probably already reporting on these issues in general, so make sure to do it with the big one in
mind.
Sources: Meet the experts and let them teach you. Get their cell numbers.
Data: Download databases that are available from both state and federal government.
Maps: If you can, get comfortable with the mapping opportunities, since geographical analysis
will be key during an environmental catastrophe.
FOIA: File records requests for data and emergency plans that aren’t available online.

Becoming the expert
●

Experts: Environmental disasters can be challenging because reporters typically don’t have
expertise on things like deep-seated landslides, storage-tank construction, fertilizer plants or a
specific flood plain. As the disaster unfolds, get outside experts to teach you.
● Study: Understanding the science behind a specific natural disaster can require many hours
reading extremely technical reports. Doing that work will pay off.
● Truth: Studying the research can help you beat the PR spin.
● Breadth: With a knowledge base, you can better identify other areas at similar risk.

Tips for finding the records you need
●

Wide net: Send records requests to agencies big and small. Environmental issues typically
involve a lot of overlap between multiple federal, state and local agencies. Agencies with a
limited role may be able to get you records a lot faster.
● Feds: Don’t shy away from the feds. Regional offices of an agency can respond quickly. Much
faster than going through DC.
● Private sector: Engineering firms and other private scientists have likely worked with the
government and have their own records that they are glad to share.
● Archives: In planning for natural disasters, government officials can often take a short-term view
and overlook the long-term risks. Go through local, state, federal and news archives to trace
how agencies have handled the issue in decades past.

Common areas to find stories

Review emergency plans to see if they were up to date or sufficient.
Neighborhood/building permitting decisions. Environmental stories often involve businesses or
political leaders taking risks to save or make money -- no shelters, poor building materials,
dangerous developments, limited emergency-response infrastructure.
Review notification systems to see if people were properly warned
Review response by emergency personnel, including how agencies outside the area responded
to the call for help. Did bureaucracy delay aid?
Charities, including direct-fundraising campaigns online that can be shady.
FEMA and SBA spending. Were politically-connected companies getting cleanup contracts? Were
people far from the disaster abusing the SBA system to get loan?
Did responsible parties properly mitigate the environmental impacts?
Overtime, expenses and other costs of clean-up
Did political leaders fulfill the promises they made to communities and people impacted?
