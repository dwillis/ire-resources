Tired Truckers
The idea for this story began when it seemed like Nashville had a trucking accident nearly every day. In
one case, a sleepy trucker killed an Iraq war vet and his daughter. Our investigation found that in the
last five years in Tennessee, there were 64 crashes where a sleepy trucker had killed someone. They
are rarely even given a ticket. If you want to pursue a local version of the sleepy trucker story, see if
your state uses Uniform Traffic Crash Reports. Here’s a sample:

We requested a database from the Tennessee Department of Safety that would include all crashes
involving large trucks where there were injuries or fatalities during a five-year period. There is a
section called "Driver Factors" on that report. Police officers can check up to three boxes that describe
the "Driver Condition." One of the driver conditions is "apparently asleep," driver condition 5. We found
64 cases where truck drivers who were apparently asleep had been involved in an injury or fatal crash.
There's another field, the driver violation field; that indicates whether police wrote a citation. That's
how we calculated that 70 percent of the time, truckers were never ticketed, even if they killed
someone.
Using another database of Dept of Safety commercial driver inspection reports, we found that in three
years, more than 1900 truck drivers were cited for driving over the allowable number of hours. Some
drivers had been on the road 15, 17, even 22 hours straight.

We also calculated the average fine for driving over hours (we used a local traffic ticket database for
this one) and found that over-hours truckers paid an average fine of $231. To do this story, find out
which agency inspects truckers’ logbooks (in our case, it’s the TN Department of Safety), then track the
cases through your local traffic courts. The local courts that will have the most trucker tickets will be
inside jurisdictions with weigh stations.
If you are interested in investigating trucking, here are some great links, first compiled by the David
Barnes, the OIG for the US Department of Transportation:
