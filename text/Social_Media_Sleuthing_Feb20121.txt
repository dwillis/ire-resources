Social Media Sleuthing

Doug Haddix

Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter are great resources for
finding people, especially high school and college students
who haven't established much of a paper trail.
The information on employer, location and friends is
incredibly valuable – often the only means of contact.
We also find people who have commented on those
(Facebook) pages, or claim to be employees or members
of the organization, to give us some inside details.
