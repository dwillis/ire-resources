 22: BEA - Gross domestic product by metropolitan area, 2011 and revised 2001-2010. These
estimates measure the economic output of a metropolitan statistical area. Details:

18: BLS - January employment and unemployment for states and regions. These estimates are
based on the Current Employment Statistics, a monthly survey of 141,000 businesses with
486,000 worksites (establishments). Data are adjusted to smooth seasonal variation and revised
each year with new Census Bureau population estimates and other data. Details:
http://www.bls.gov/sae/home.htm. Remember that this is a survey. Its figures carry a margin of
error, just like a public opinion poll. The squishiness depends on the size of a state or industry. In
general, don’t make a big deal about small changes (http://www.bls.gov/sae/790stderr.htm).
22: BLS - January employment and unemployment for metros, cities and counties. The Local
Area Unemployment Statistics data are compiled for more than 7,000 areas ranging from states
and metropolitan areas to counties and towns. The raw data come from several sources, including
state unemployment insurance programs and BLS’ Current Employment Statistics. Each state uses
a model to produce estimates that are squared up with the monthly survey that produces the
official national unemployment rate (Current Population Survey). In this way, a fairly consistent
set of timely estimates is produced for small areas. Beginning in 2011, metro-level data was
smoothed and seasonally adjusted to improve comparisons. But data below the metro level is not
seasonally adjusted, so you’ll see swings through the year. It’s best to focus on year-over-year
comparisons. Details: http://www.bls.gov/lau.
27: BEA - State quarterly personal income, for all four quarters of 2012 and the annual figure
for 2012 (preliminary estimates.) State personal income is the income received by all persons
residing in a state from all sources. Details:
http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/regional/spi/sqpi_newsrelease.htm
28: BLS - Q3 2012 county employment and wages. This is based on the Quarterly Census of
Employment and Wages, which in turn is based on records that businesses and governments file
when they pay premiums into unemployment-insurance programs. In 2010, this included almost 9
million establishments and almost 128 million workers. Details: http://www.bls.gov/cew. Since it
covers all insured workers – and not just a sampling drawn for a survey – you don’t have to keep
error margins in mind. But remember that it doesn’t include some farm workers, the selfemployed, sole proprietors and a few other small categories. BLS has launched the beta version of
an interactive map, table and download tool to display data for each state and county
(http://beta.bls.gov/maps/cew/us).
29: BLS - February employment and unemployment for states and regions. Details:
http://www.bls.gov/sae/home.htm
29: BLS - Annual occupational employment and wages for states and metros for 2012. This
data tallies people by up to 800 occupations in 23 major groups
(http://bls.gov/oes/current/oes_stru.htm). It’s based on six mail surveys collected over three years,
so keep in mind that 2011 data reflects 2009-11. Full national results cover 1.2 million workplaces
and a bit less than two-thirds of the workforce. Caution: Shifts in metro boundaries, occupational
classifications and survey methods make it difficult to compare data from two periods. This data is
best used for the rich portrait each set can offer about a local area’s workforce and how it differs
from those in other areas. Details: http://bls.gov/oes/home.htm.

10: BLS - February employment and unemployment for metros, cities and counties. Details:

19: BLS -- March employment and unemployment for states and regions. Details:
http://www.bls.gov/sae/home.htm (See March.)
DATE TK – Census -- In years that end with “2” and “7”, the Census Bureau collects detailed
data from every business in its master file – the Economic Census. (See December). This
benchmarks a smaller annual report called County Business Patterns, which also provides metrolevel data. County Business Patterns data for 2011 is due late this month. It includes the number of
establishments and employees, quarterly and annual payroll ($) and the number of establishments
by employment. This is one of the agency’s longest-running business surveys, dating to 1964. A
major change in industrial classification makes comparisons before 1992 difficult, but that still
leaves almost two decades of annual data for almost every county. This data excludes tiny
businesses with no employees. (See May.) It’s very useful for tracking trends in the makeup of a
local economy, especially in hard-to-cover portions such as social services; professional services
such as law and accounting; and the arts, such as theater companies, sports teams, amusement
parks and zoos. Details: http://www.census.gov/econ/cbp.

DATE TK -- Census - The ZIP Code-level version of County Business Patterns data for 2011 is
due out this month. Details: http://www.census.gov/econ/cbp (See April.) The format is the same,
but because ZIPs are smaller, more data are not broken out to avoid the disclosure of individual
establishment’s information. That info is, however, included in totals. Save this tool for larger ZIP
Codes and focus on the top level of the economy (two-digit NAICS codes:
http://www.census.gov/eos/www/naics)
DATE TK: Census - More than half of U.S. businesses have no employees. Each one is just one
person. We usually don’t think of people as “non-employer businesses.” We know them as
handymen, freelancers, caterers, consultants, authors, hair stylists, coaches and the like. Most
Census Bureau business data specifically excludes these people, but this month, a basic report is
due on their ranks in 2011. Totals are reported for states, metros and counties. They are crosstallied as corporations, sole proprietorships and partnerships. Details:
http://www.census.gov/econ/nonemployer. Non-employers produce just a few percentage points
of overall economic output, but this data offers valuable clues about the growing edge of an area’s
economy, a chaotic slice where dreams blossom and die all the time. The raw data come from the
IRS: returns from people who file as businesses, claim no employees and have at least $1,000 in
annual revenue (http://www.census.gov/econ/nonemployer). Collecting accurate data on millions
of tiny businesses is fraught with hazards. Many of these people strive to stay off the
government’s radar, so think of totals as approximations. The bureau also tweaks some totals to
avoid disclosure. The size of the nudge it gives to each affected cell is marked with a noise flag:
low, moderate or high.

DATE TK: Census - Advance report on 2012 Economic Census. Details:
http://www.census.gov/econ/census/
The Census Bureau takes this census in years that end in “2” and “7.” It collects information for
each establishment (location) of every firm of every type. This data becomes the bedrock on which
more abbreviated and frequent surveys are based, such as the annual County Business Patterns
survey. (See March.) The Economic Census also includes some embedded specialty surveys, such
as one that provides demographic information on business owners and another on firms owned by
minorities and women.
The Economic Census includes very detailed information on employment, wages and sales. It also
includes detailed data on how much of each raw material an establishment takes in and what it
pays for it. On the output side, it collects similar information on the types and amounts of finished
products and revenue. The difference between input expense and output revenue -- the value
added by each establishment – becomes the raw material for countless studies and economic
models of how the U.S. economy works. The Economic Census produces a series of reports by

industry, then by large areas and finally small areas. These reports will continue through 2014
(http://www.census.gov/econ/census/schedule.html). Comparing the 2012 census with its
counterpart from 2007 – taken just as the Great Recession was beginning – will let journalists,
businesses, government officials and scholars measure its toll in detail. It will also let us write
report cards on trends such as globalization, the aging workforce and the explosion of e-commerce.
