What is a
“public
record”?

Any writing
1. containing information relating
to the conduct of government or
performance of a governmental
function
2. prepared, owned, used, or
retained by a state or local agency
3. regardless of physical form or
characteristics
- RCW 42.56.010

Examples of
government-r
elated
“writings”
available
under the
Public Records
Act

● Metadata embedded in an
email on a deputy mayor’s
home computer hard drive
● O’Neill v. Shoreline (2010)
● Surveillance footage of a
shooting on a private college
campus
● Jane Does v. King Co. (2015)
● Records of a private public
relations consultant acting in
a government capacity

county employees made to
the Internet
● Belenski v. Jeﬀerson Co. (2015)
● Work-related text messages
on an elected prosecutor’s
private cell phone
● Nissen v. Pierce Co. (2015)

● Who? Every agency is supposed to identify a public records oﬃcer
responsible for handling requests. RCW 42.56.580

How do
we request
public
records?

● What? “[T]here is no oﬃcial format for a valid PDA request,”
except that it must identify records with “reasonable clarity” to
allow the agency to locate them. Hangartner v. Seattle (2004)
● Where? A request can be submitted through an online portal, by
email, fax or mail, or in person. WAC 44-14-030(4)
● - search the agency’s web site for instructions
● - call for instructions if there are none online
● - send a written request to the location speciﬁed
● When? The sooner the better. An agency can take 5 days just to
estimate how long it will take to produce records. RCW 42.56.520

Don’t ignore a
clariﬁcation request

TRAPS FOR
THE UNWARY

Don’t forget to
pick up an installment

● If a records requester fails to respond
when asked to clarify what records are
desired, the agency “need not respond”
to the records request to the extent it is
unclear.

● If an agency makes records available on
an installment basis (one batch at a
time), and an installment “is not claimed
or reviewed,” the agency is not obligated
to fulﬁll the rest of the request.

● RCW 42.56.520(3)(b)

● RCW 42.56.120(4)

Don’t forget to pay
● An agency may require a deposit of 10
percent of the estimated cost of all
records before providing them, or may
charge for each installment as it is
provided.

Ask for
“identiﬁable records”
●

● RCW 42.56.120(4)
●

● Ask for less (smaller requests are faster).
● Describe the desired records as clearly as possible.

How can we
speed up
the process?

● Suggest search terms that are likely to lead to the desired records.
● Identify which records are needed ﬁrst.
● Make the records oﬃcer aware of any deadline or time sensitivity.
● Quickly answer questions about the request.
● Quickly send payment.
● Consider inspecting ﬁles in person to narrow the copying request.
● Ask for updates.
● Ask for a speciﬁc explanation of time estimates.
● Get an attorney involved.
