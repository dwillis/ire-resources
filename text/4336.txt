ACA Data Dive
THE NUMBERS THAT CAN HELP MAKE SENSE OF OBAMACARE

First, a primer
- Along with a bunch of other things, the Affordable Care Act requires that most
legal residents have health insurance.
- To get that insurance, the state or federal government has set up
“marketplaces” or “exchanges” offering a variety of private insurance plans for
purchase.
- Thirty four states didn’t set up an exchange, and instead use healthcare.gov
(the “federal exchange.”) Three states (Oregon, Nevada and New Mexico) set up
a state exchange but use healthcare.gov to handle signups. Thirteen states have
their own exchanges.

The details
- Insurance plans are set up in tiers – Catastrophic (for young ‘uns only), Bronze,
Silver, Gold and Platinum. Platinum plans, for instance, have higher monthly
premiums than Bronze, but tend to have low deductibles, smaller co-pays and
sometimes wider networks.

- Consumers who make less than 400% of the federal poverty level are eligible
for subsidies to help offset their costs. (Poverty level for a family of four =
$23,850 in 2014)
- Subsidies are based on the price of the second-lowest silver tier plan.

But what about the state exchanges?
State exchange data is tough to get in a digital format similar to the federal
exchange in a timely manner.
You can try:
- Your state insurance commission
- Private analysts

Subsidies
How much are people REALLY paying for health care on the exchanges?
On Healthcare.gov as of the end of January:
◦ 87% received a subsidy
◦ Average subsidy covered 72% of their premium cost
◦ State-level report as of January:

Who the heck are all these uninsured
people, anyway?
It helps to know the pool of potential health care exchange consumers
when figuring out how successful places have been at signing folks up:

Who enrolled? There’s a ton of data on that.
◦ HHS puts out enrollment “snapshots” on its blog weekly during the
enrollment period: http://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/facts/blog/index.html

◦ The Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation office puts out more
detailed information periodically

What’s the future?
What effect will more
insured individuals
have on the health
care system?

Tax time

Those who don’t have health insurance may have to pay a penalty. Those
who received too much of a subsidy (because their income changed midyear, for instance) may also owe money.
