The White House http://www.whitehouse.gov
House of Representatives http://www.house.gov
Senate http://www.senate.gov
Legislative Information on the Net http://thomas.loc.gov

with links to U.S. government websites at http://www.fedworld.gov/gov-links.html
Audit reports and other studies from the Office of the Inspector General in the
respective federal departments and agencies are also a great place to look for stories.
The Food and Drug Administration (http://www.fda.gov) has much material available.
It has a great search engine where you can search by company name, drug name etc. For
major decisions about approving of withdrawing drugs, which most likely will affect
your country, the FDA convenes meetings of outside advisers. The meetings are almost
always public and cameras and tape recorders are allowed. The background documents
for the meetings are generally made available on the FDA site in the lead-up to
meetings.
Federal agencies is required under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to disclose
records requested in writing by any person, but may withhold information pursuant to
nine exemptions and three exclusions contained in the statute. The FOIA applies only to
federal agencies and does not create a right of access to records held by Congress, the
courts, or by state or local government agencies. Each state has its own public access
laws that should be consulted for access to state and local records. The Department of
Justice has links to federal agencies' Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) web sites.

Federal Business Opportunity (http://www.fedbizopps.gov/) is a U.S. government-run
web site that allows you to search for current contract opportunities within the U.S.
government as well as the details of recently-awarded contracts. This is a new site that is
still being updated and is incomplete, so if you do not find what you are looking for you
should also search in the Federal Procurement Data Center, which is part of the U.S.
General Services Administration and maintains a database on federal contracts worth
more than $25,000. A search engine allows you to search for government contracts
geographically (both U.S. localities and foreign countries) and by contractor:
http://www.fpdc.gov/fpdc/agency_reports.htm
The U.S. Office of Trade and Economic Analysis has compiled an extensive set of links

The SEC’s EDGAR database at http://www.sec.gov. Publicly traded companies are
required to file 10-K forms every year and 10-Q forms every quarter. In them, they
must list any legal challenges the company faces domestically and abroad. You should
also check for 20-F forms, which some companies file in lieu of 10-Ks. Edgar can be
searched generally by company name, or by specific form. The SEC does not require
companies to list their foreign subsidiaries, and if the companies are privately held,
nothing will be available.
Although it is a subscription service, Edgar Online (http://www.edgar-online.com/) is an
easy way to search for a name in SEC filings to see if the person you are looking for has
any business interests in the United States or in U.S.-related companies. An alternate site
is the 10K Wizard (http://www.tenkwizard.com/).
Foreign Policy, Intelligence, Military and Terrorism
The State Department has a list of all U.S. embassies and other diplomatic missions
abroad. http://usembassy.state.gov/
The individual country reports (http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/) and the annual
human rights reports are worth checking out (http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2002/)

State Magazine (http://www.state.gov/m/dghr/statemag/) is the monthly magazine for
the U.S. State Department. The issues are available online or you can get a subscription
through the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, 866-5121800 (toll free) or on the web at http://bookstore.gpo.gov. It’s a good way to stay on top
of what’s going on in the State Department and to get names of potential sources.

officials often frequent such groups and they are normally more willing to talk than
current officials.
