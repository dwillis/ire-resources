Request original records behind the data

Who is an outlier? Use average, median
Do each calculation on a number field. My favorite? Difference. Marriage age.
Who is missing from the data?
Looking at the biggest fish? Ask Why. What are some explanatory factors that
put them at the top? Look at other fields

Finding Stories in

Outliers and patterns

Lake County is an
outlier. It is small and
does not represent
the story as a whole.

San Benito County is larger and represents the
patterns in the data as a whole. The search
disparity is not as wide but it is more typical. Use
the patterns within the data to decide where to go
for shoe-leather reporting.

Sometimes dots
on a map can tell
a story, if you
provide the
context

Geographic data as a way to find sources,
victims and important narrative detail:
