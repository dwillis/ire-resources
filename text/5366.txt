What’s “The Census?”

IPUMS and microdata
What’s “The Census?”
“The Census” is not any one thing. The Census Bureau conducts dozens of surveys.
Usually, when people refer to “The Census”, they mean the Decennial Census, which is
conducted every ten years on the “0” as prescribed by the U.S. Constitution.

IPUMS and microdata
What’s “The Census?”
"Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be
included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers . . . The actual Enumeration shall be
made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every
subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall by Law direct." -- Article I, Section 2

IPUMS and microdata
What’s “The Census?”
The modern Census Bureau conducts dozens of ongoing surveys, measuring everything from
commute times to retail sales. Data is published in the form of data tables that users can download
and analyze using software such as Excel, Tableau, QGIS, etc.

IPUMS and microdata
What’s “The Census?”
For demographics on an annual basis, there are two commonly used surveys:

The Current Population Survey
The American Community Survey

IPUMS and microdata
What’s “The Census?”
The Current Population Survey is a monthly survey of about 60,000 households conducted jointly with
the Bureau of Labor Statistics with the primary purpose of measuring the labor force and employment.
However, there are various sets of supplemental questions asked during different months, including
the Annual Social and Economic Supplement each March which asks a broad array of questions
about household members including their race, age, health insurance status, marital status, education
level, income etc.

The American Community Survey is a rolling survey of about 3.5 million households that asks and
even more detailed set of questions about households. The large sample size makes it possible for
the ACS to produce estimates at very small levels of geography.

The last time I looked, there were 35,000 total variables spread across 1,500 subject tables covering
more than 13,000 geographies.

But even with all of this information, what if there is a breakdown you don’t see?
What if you want to calculate the poverty rate for other cohorts?
What if you wanted marital status by age and race and college degree?
This is where microdata can help...

IPUMS and microdata
What’s Microdata?
To quote myself:

“Microdata empowers you to customize the ACS, creating your own tables out of any variables
in the data set. That’s because microdata is a person-level sample of the actual Census returns—
each row is an individual observation, populated by column after column of responses for that
person to Census questions.”

What’s Microdata?
To quote myself:

“With these new powers comes additional journalistic responsibilities, beyond the additional
skills required Simply put, the microdata comes without a governor. Just because you can
technically cross any and all variables doesn’t mean such a query makes analytical sense.”

IPUMS and microdata
What’s Microdata?
-- Each row in a microdata set represents the responses to the ACS questionnaire for a
single person
-- The first set of columns is information about that person’s household and repeats for
all people in the household (this is called “rectangularized” data)
-- The rest is information unique to that person.
-- All information is anonymized and the Census Bureau will use sophisticated
estimation techniques to fill in missing information

IPUMS and microdata

IPUMS and microdata
What’s Microdata?
-- There are about 3.2 million person records per year
-- Each record is weighted so estimates made with microdata closely track published
tables. You can benchmark your preliminary queries this way.
-- ACS microdata is published as multi-year samples as well as single year;
-- Bigger sample size from the multi-year reduces margin of error but makes estimates
slightly less current

IPUMS and microdata
What’s IPUMS?
-- IPUMS is a third-party demographic research organization based at the University of
Minnesota that provides a fabulous set of microdata tools that make it easier to work
with data online or as a download.
-- IPUMS provides a number of value-added variable that make it much easier to
generate time series estimates. This is often difficult with the published tables.
-- IPUMS is free and open -- the organization just requests attribution when using their
data.

What’s IPUMS?
One time I was working with a reporter on a feature story about old fashioned barber
shops in New Jersey. One thing you might observe about these places -- they are often
headed by an immigrant. In New Jersey, a lot of old-fashioned barber shops are Italian.
But can this be measured? With published Census tables, the occupation data is often
too general. And isn’t crossed with place-of-birth. And doesn’t go back over time.

Let me show you how IPUMS solves this problem….
1) Sign up for a free account at ipums.org
2) Click on “Analyze Data Online”
3) Select the United States 1850-2016 sample

IPUMS and microdata
What’s IPUMS?
Let me show you how IPUMS solves this problem….
IPUMS uses the SDA query interface, which allows you to design crosstab queries,
collapse variables into custom groupings, and split results across additional variables.
The available variables are listed on the left. The query interface is on the right.
It will be easier to understand with a demo.

IPUMS and microdata
What’s IPUMS?
With all querying languages, it’s helpful to express what we want to learn as a question,
and then design a query that will answer that question.
In this case, our question is: What percentage of barbers were foreign born over time?
To answer this question, I’m envisioning a table where each row is a place of birth for a
barber, and each column is a year….

IPUMS and microdata
What’s IPUMS?
I will use the IPUMS variable guide to figure out which variables will get me what I need.
First, a variable that will tell me the barber’s place of birth…
Under Person, there is Race, Ethnicity and Nativity… and in that category, there is a
variable called BPL. When I click on it, I get a full explanation.
Looks good, so I’m going to add it to the row of my query.

IPUMS and microdata
What’s IPUMS?
Next, I need to put the year as the column.
I bet it’s probably called year, and i can confirm hat with the quick-list of variables on
the left side of the screen.
Yes -- that goes into the column box on my query interface.

IPUMS and microdata
What’s IPUMS?
Now, I need the most important component of the query -- something that filters this
down to only barbers. This is where IPUMS can be really handy.
Census occupation codes have changed dramatically over the years. But IPUMS
maintains a “harmonized” set of codes that span the decades -- each time the codes
change, they make a bridge to previous code sets.
Under Person/Work there are three to choose from: OCC1950, OCC1990, OCC2010

IPUMS and microdata
What’s IPUMS?
Looking in OCC1950, we see that code 740 is “Barbers, beauticians, and manicurists” -bingo, that goes into our filter as OCC1950(740).
Our last step is to declare the years we’re interested in. Let’s start in 1950 and include
all of the decennial census samples, and then include the 2010 and 2016 ACS.
year(1950,1960,1970,1980,1990,2000,2010, 2016)
For now, let’s turn off percentages and color codes and run the thing...

IPUMS and microdata
What’s IPUMS?
Wow, that was interesting, but what a mess. The first issue is that it gave us every state
and country of birth instead of U.S.-born vs. foreign born.
So let’s collapse that bpl variable by using a little SDA syntax. If we go back to the BPL
code sheet, it looks like anything below 150 is U.S.-born, anything 150 or above is
foreign born. So the syntax for that is:
bpl(r:0-149;150-*) -- we can put this right in the row box. Let’s also this time ask for a
column percentage...

IPUMS and microdata
What’s IPUMS?
Now we’re getting somewhere. The foreign born percentage had been falling but it’s
picking up again. Let’s see what would happen if we break this down by region.
In our quick variable list on the left, under geographic, there is in fact a variable called
region. Let’s add it to the “Control” box and rerun the query.
The results yield a number of surprises….

IPUMS and microdata
What’s IPUMS?
Remember, we’re dealing with a sample survey. This means these are estimates and
subject to a margin of error. Thankfully, IPUMS makes those calculations simple. Just
re-run the same query and ask for the 90 pct confidence interval….
Often in a graphic, you might consider presenting a trend with three lines - the top,
bottom and estimate.

IPUMS and microdata
What’s IPUMS?
But do not become trapped by these error margins. They do not mean what you’re
seeing is not a trend -- they mean that you need to treat your results as estimates and
supplement your findings with additional reporting.
If the differences from year to year bounced up and down a lot, or were small, you’d be
more concerned.

IPUMS and microdata
What’s IPUMS?
Let’s try one more. Let’s say we really wanted to zero in on Uncle Franco and look at
just men born in Italy.
Let’s collapse or row into three categories, US-born, Foreign-born but not Italy, and
Italy-born: bpl(r:1-149;150-433,435-*;434)
Let’s remove our control and add sex(1) to the filter to look at only males….

IPUMS and microdata
What’s IPUMS?
At the time Franco came to the U.S., about 10 percent of all male barbers were born in
Italy -- but by 2000, that number was down to around 1-2 percent where it remains
today.

IPUMS and microdata
In closing…
-- You can also make “extracts” and download the data and write queries using your
own software -- the extracts support a number of formats.
-- You can also use IPUMS to query CPS ASEC data. This is usually preferable if you need
year by year time series and don’t mind the smaller sample size because you’re only
doing national estimates.
