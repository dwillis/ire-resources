Time-series correlation
• Is the decrease real?
• Kendall’s Tau
• Independent variable is time
• Can be done in most stats programs
• Add-on for Excel called XLSTAT
• A valuable check on any data where you might
think there is a trend

Regression

Regression
When you run a regression, you get a result called an Rsquare. That will help you see how much the independent
variable predicts the dependent variable.

Then use that information to “adjust” the data or to
see if entities are doing better or worse than they
should.

Binary Logistic Regression
Often the data we work with doesn’t have a continuous
value as the outcome. We deal with data that has binary
outcomes: yes/no, got selected/didn’t get selected.
You also can use logistic regression when you have more
than two categories.

Logistic Regression
Logistic regression looks at how much one more
independent variables affect the likelihood of the
dependent variable.
It also allows you control for all the other factors that
might also contribute to the outcome variable.
Is there really an effect or is just explained by something
else.

Performing logistic regression
There are add-on tools for Excel. But you also can do
logistic regression in your statistics program. (Warning: in
some pay software, such as SPSS, logistic is an add-on
module and one key test is not yet available in PSPP.)

Monte Carlo Simulations
and
The Multiple Comparisons Problem
John Templon, BuzzFeed News

What Are Monte Carlo Simulations?
From Wikipedia: Monte Carlo methods (or
Monte Carlo experiments) are a broad class
of computational algorithms that rely on
repeated random sampling to obtain
numerical results.
Monte Carlo simulations result in a distribution of outcomes.
They’re good for answering questions such:
●
●

How often does X happen?
How often does something more/less than X happen?

To figure out how often you’d expect a tennis player to lose a
certain number of matches. (BuzzFeed News:

To figure out who is going to have the best record in the NBA.

To simulate playing the New York state lottery. (BuzzFeed

To figure out improbable backdating on stock prices. (Wall Street

A Simple Example
A Monte Carlo simulation takes a chain of events,
such as flipping a coin 10 times, and calculates
the results, such as the percentage chance you’ll
get heads all 10 times. You run the test once
(flip the coin 10 times), and record the result
(count the number of heads). Then you run the
same test over a large sample of times, say 1
million simulations.
(This is why you need computer code. Otherwise
your finger might get tired.)
Note: The probability is 1 in 1,024 (1 / 0.5^10).

Monte Carlo Simple Example

Monte Carlo Simple Example
Results
The 10 heads result occurred 942 times in 1
million simulations or 0.000942. The
probability says it should’ve occurred
approximately 0.000976, or 976 times.

Multiple Comparisons Problem
If you look at a large number of probabilistic
results it becomes more likely that you’re going
to find a result that “looks” significant.
If you test 20 observations you would expect one,
by chance, to have a probability of 0.05 (1 / 20).
How can we control for that issue?

Bonferroni Example
Example:
10 observations: 0.156, 0.141, 0.345, 0.561, 0.010,
0.005, 0.003, 0.943, 0.004, 0.001
If you didn’t correct you would get 5 significant
results (red and orange).
Bonferroni: Look for a p-value that is less than
0.05 / 10 = 0.005 instead.
Once you correct for the multiple hypotheses there
are 3 significant results.
