Digging deeper with data and

A “DOCUMENTS STATE OF MIND”

A Document State of Mind
• Broad analysis allows for
stronger stories rooted in
fact.
• Instead of relying on a
source for a statement,
document and datadriven journalism allows
reporters to make
empirical statements.

Increase Credibility
• Not always stats or numbers: often, just
electronic versions of paper records.
• Elevate anecdotes, proving individual cases are
truly representative (or not).
• Analysis can provide framework for entire story.
• Reveal truths by exploring data.

When “no” really means “maybe” and eventually “okay, fine.”

Federal FOIA, in theory
• What’s can one get?
• “Records”
• What must a request contain?
• “a reasonable description” of what you
want
• Who can use FOIA?
• A “Person”
• How long do you have to wait?
• 20 business days, unless of an “unusual
circumstance”

Federal FOIA, in practice

The Department of Homeland Security is still processing 2012 requests, 22,000
requests took more than 200 days and when it granted requests, it redacted
records under exemptions for ongoing investigations, personal privacy, and
“internal agency memos” hundreds of thousands of times.

Crafting Requests
Public Records

1. Do some background
research. Which agency
would be most likely to
have records?
2. Do some reporting. Has
this information been
requested in the past? Has
it ever been provided?
3. Read examples of
successful requests and
FOIA logs.
4. Make requests specific and
targeted.
5. When asking for data,
provide start and end
dates.
6. Make statements, don’t
ask questions.

Tools for Tracking Requests
Public Records

• Point and click interfaces for creating Freedom of
Information Act requests
• Helps to deliver requests to the relevant agency
• Manage, track and share communications

Don’t trust FOIA officers to get it right the first time around.

Tricks for Transparency
Public Records

• Read the regulations: What records are required
to be tracked and reported? (Record retention
schedules)
• Read academic literature. What have people
studied in the past?
• Talk to experts and sources. Are there internal
reports or analyses?
• Look at footnotes in public documents. Where
does information come from?
• Learn your FOIA officer’s home phone number.
Call them.

Tricks for Transparency
Record Layouts

• Many people are intimidated by large data
sets.
– FOIA officers often say it’s too much to handle.
“That’ll be more than a million records!”
– Request a copy of the record layout. This will tell
you how the database is structured and may give
you clues as to how to nudge your request
forward.

USEFUL TOOLS

Spreadsheet Tools
• Excel
– Available on most computers.
– The go-to tool for beginning data
analysis.

• Google Spreadsheets
– Offers much of the same
functionality as Excel.
– Excellent for collaboration.

Spreadsheet Tools II
• Open Refine

– A good tool for working with messy data.
– Clean and cluster information.

• Google Fusion Tables

– Visualize large data sets (maps).
– Data discovery tools.

• Tableau

– Collaborative tool helps with data organization,
mining and visualization.

Databases

Spreadsheets on Steroids

• Access

– Good beginning database tool available on most
computers.

• Microsoft SQL

– Extremely powerful database program that can handle
files with trillions of records.

• MySQL

– Freely available database program.

• PostgreSQL

– Another freely available database program.

Other Tools
• ArcGIS
– Powerful mapping program.

• QGIS
– Free mapping program.

• Gephi
– Social network analysis tool.

Programming Languages
• Scripting languages: great for repetitive tasks
and scraping data off websites.
– Python
– Ruby
– PHP

• Statistical programming languages:
–R
– SPSS
– SAS

TELLING STORIES WITH DATA

The worst kind of data story: “Here’s
some data! Find a story!”
The best kind of data story: “There
was election fraud. Let’s find the data
to prove it!”

Data often
follows a
theoretical
distribution

In real life,
this is
always
messy

In journalism, we like things to be obvious

We can estimate the
probability of our biggest
outlier on this chart, a
physical therapist who took
in about $4.1 million.

0.00028%
Given that more than
36,000 physical therapists
were reimbursed by
Medicare in 2012, this isn’t
actually very interesting. We
would expect such an
outlier about once every 9.5
years.
That’s a lot of work, and by
itself, this is not a killer
story.

Was it statistically significant? Yes.
• A political science professor who studied vote fraud in
Russia helped us.
• He used the statistical technique of “resampling,” or
drawing the same data randomly a bunch of times to see
how frequently it formed a comparable distribution to the
one we observed.

Sometimes, all you
need is one record

[Hudson Yard’s developer] Related is

the single largest user of EB-5
financing. By its own measure, it
accounts for about 20% of the dollars
being raised through the program
today. The closely held company used
the program to raise $600 million for
a first phase of Hudson Yards last year
and is in the process of raising
another $600 million […]
Key to doing so is having the
surrounding community designated a
Targeted Employment Area, meaning
one where the jobless rate is at least
150% of the national average. That
status lets foreign investors move
toward a U.S. green card by putting
up $500,000, typically as a loan.
