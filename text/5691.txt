http://lawcenter.giffords.org/resources/publications/domestic-violence-and-guns-state-by-state/
-Who collects data in your area? Contact agency/department in charge.
-Before you FOIA (or state records request) - determine which information your state collects.

DV Protection Orders tied to low-level criminal cases can be charged 1-2 years before
shooting/homicide case
http://www.gunviolencearchive.org/query -Good resource for most NOT ALL shootings – lists the
names of defendants
Build a separate database of confirmed/likely cases
Keep database current after the story airs – can help on other stories with high-profile gun crimes

-Determine court policies for proof of gun relinquishment
Example: Must defendant appear before a judge? Is paperwork enough?
-Figure out who in your community stores firearms. Query them about the law.
-Collaboration with your news partners (TV, print, digital) can increase traction and depth.

WCAU-TV: Vehicles designed to help save lives may be putting them in jeopardy
NBC 10 Investigators are tipped off about an ambulance company with vehicles not fit to
be on the road.
Link to Stories: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odxOijBS1JA&feature=youtu.be
-Our reporting uncovers a state investigation and our stories catch the attention of the
State Police- who file criminal action against the company.
-Next, we uncover an existing law may be part of the problem – NBC 10 then turns its
attention to lawmakers to hold them accountable and seek action.
-Unravel the investigation in pieces to get more traction; look beyond the “big tell.”
-Scratch below the surface in search of the “there-there” - When you’re told it’s a
“nothing burger” get your napkin out for some “there-there!”

The following are useful to follow up on investigations and the status of companies which
may be in violation of state laws.
