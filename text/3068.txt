Go through the data analysis step by step. Ask until
you understand.
Make sure that “devil’s advocate” queries/tests were
done.
Apply your own logic.
Make sure the story says what the numbers say.
Check for areas where the story exceeds the analysis’
reach.
Run every conclusion by the agency/people involved.
If you used a consultant or expert early on, run all your
conclusions by them, in exactly the way you plan to
present them.
Make sure each graphic/Web element tells the story
accurately.
