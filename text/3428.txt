Hearing loss is way up (background:

Vision loss is also a problem (Background: http://www.research.va.gov/resources/pubs/docs/VisionLoss.pdf)
Traumatic Brain Injury is not being diagnosed or treated (Background:

Post-traumatic stress disorder is complicated. It’s extremely important to tell all sides of that story

Veterans are going back to school, and often their issues come to the forefront there. Talk to the
veterans office at your local college.
Provide hope. Write about what your community is doing to address the problem, and about what
works.
As many as 1 out of 8 veterans are unemployed. Homelessness is up.

People are coming home to your communities with injuries from the burn pits in Iraq and
Afghanistan (Background: www.burnpits.org)
There are not enough mental health providers, especially those who focus on combat trauma, at VA
or in your community, especially if you live in a rural area or near a military base.
The research and medical advances coming from these wars are phenomenal. See what your local
hospital is using – especially for Traumatic Brain Injuries, amputations and other traumatic
injuries.
Sleeping disorders – insomnia, sleep apnea – are through the roof. They’ll be bringing that home.
The bureaucracy and wait times for treatment and disability pay are mind-numbing. Ask around.

How to get at these stories:
 Talk to your local advocates. Vet Centers are a good place to start.
 FaceBook – you’ll find local groups and veterans there.
 Go to the VFW. They’ve been strong advocates for veterans’ issues, and they can point you to local
people trying to help out.
 Talk to the courts and police about what they’re seeing in military communities – and what they’re
doing about it. Is spousal/child abuse up? Divorce rates? Are there military court programs in your
community? Family counseling for veterans?
 Talk to your local arts community. Many of these guys are putting their emotions into paintings,
just as they did during Vietnam. That’s a great in for getting them to talk in general.
 Talk to local physicians and counselors. Are they seeing increases in sleeping disorders, headaches,
depression. There’s probably a story in what they’re doing to educate themselves
 Disabled American Veterans reviews each of the local VA facilities
How to conduct those interviews with veterans:
 Don’t ask, “How many people did you kill.”
 Do ask, “What was your job.” “Where were you.” “What was the area you were in like?” “Can you
tell me about the day you were injured?” “Can you tell me about the day you lost your friend?”
 Make sure you give them plenty of room to tell the story on their own terms, and then just listen.
Often, with PTSD and TBI, there are short-term memory issues and they have to tell the whole
story to get to the question you asked. And, they often get shut down and you may be the first one
hearing all of it. Just listen. Plan to spend some time.
 Show compassion. Don’t cry. Do talk about it with someone later on if you’ve heard something that
was difficult to listen to.
 Don’t be afraid to ask questions: What’s an IED? What’s Mark 19? If you pretend like you know or
think you can just look it up later, you’re going to get yourself in trouble.
 But know as much as you can going in. If you’re going to be doing work on veterans’ issues, read up
on it. Read a book about the experience over there at the unit level. Know what the symptoms of
PTSD are. Have some clue of rank structure and unit structure.
