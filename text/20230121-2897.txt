IRE New York Workshop 2023 – Backgrounding Politicians
By Steve Eder / The New York Times / steve.eder@nytimes.com
The Basic Questions:
- Who is your subject, really?
- What should constituents know about her/him?
- What business/financial interests does the subject have now? In the past?
- Who are the key associates, aides, campaign staff, donors, and family?
- Who might help me understand my subject, and be willing to talk?
- Is the subject likely to talk to me & when/how should I make contact?
Get Organized Early:
- Set up a folder, perhaps in Google Drive, where you can dump files you find,
screenshots of web sites, records you request, and docs & spreadsheets you create
- Share the folder with any collaborators in your news organization
- Start a spreadsheet & use tabs to keep track of contacts, entities & your requests
- Begin building a timeline with links or footnotes to documents, clips and other sources
- Set up documents to catalogue 1) emerging themes & 2) Unanswered questions
- Remember: Being organized early on makes writing easier & simplifies fact-checking
Read Everything (& Takes Notes as You Go):
- Do a thorough clip search for your subject & read as much as you can
- Look for threads or themes where there there might be something more to say
- Gather old bios and resumes, often findable through LinkedIn, universities, conference
packets, board appointments, and archived web sites
- Save, download, or screenshot all relevant social posts. Look for business accounts too
- Identify books by or about your subject, as well as his/her research/articles
- Keep an eye out for video & audio. Download that too.
- Don’t forget about archival records and libraries - they store huge amounts of records
- Order a report ($) from a service like Nexis, TLO or Accurint. They include details from
public sources, like contact information, property & business records (Always verify).
Stockpile Public Records & Other Documents:
- Many government records can be found online, so get those first. Examples:
Website Registrations
Court Records
Gov’t Contracting
Lobbying Records
Business
Registrations
Charity
data

Property/Tax Data
Licenses
Audits/Reports
Financial Disclosures
Aircraft information Meeting Minutes/Hearings
Public Co. Filings
Investment Advisors
Copyright/Trademark Campaign Finance
Shortcut: Use Advanced Google search to find government docs: (i.e. site:gov “Public official”)
- Contact government agencies to make public records requests. Examples:
Calendars (electronic)
Text/Phone Records Personnel Files
Emails
Car/Driver Records Recordings/Footage
Military/Education records
Correspondence
Expenses reports
Visitor Logs
Police records
Complete File on Subject
Applications/RFPs
Legislative correspondence Forms (databases) Investigative files
Tip: Ask what an agency has already released in response to previous records requests
- When making requests, map out the possible agencies, from local to state to federal
- Build a rapport with FOIA Officers & try to work with them to get your records
- If you have trouble getting records, consult a media lawyer for advice, when possible

Try to Talk to Everyone - Cast a Wide Net
- Use your spreadsheet to map out all potential contacts, taking notes of names you have
encountered while reading, and going over documents
- Add co-workers (past & present), friends/enemies, neighbors, family & classmates
- Put people most likely to help at the top of your list
- Contact the people you don’t think will talk. You never know!
- If your subject is cooperating, ask him/her to suggest people and call those people
- Meet people in person, when possible
- Don’t hesitate to knock on a door or show up at work
- As you interview sources, think about what documents they might have and see if they
will share with you. They may have documents, such as depositions, emails, memos or
older folders that are pertinent to your subject. They can introduce you to others
- When interviewing, focus on key details that illuminate the subject and set scenes
- Challenge your sources’ recollection of facts and corroborate with other sources/docs
Preparing to Write the Story
- Write memos to yourself on interviews or key documents you find.
- Consult & update your timeline, themes, and questions docs
- Regularly think about what a story might look like (but don’t jump to conclusions)
- Imagine the article as a stand alone chapter on your subject, and set aside material that
is not central to telling that story, and consider using it in a follow-up
-

Think about the maximum story & minimum versions of your piece

Assembling a Draft
- Outline. Outline. Outline - and start writing as soon as you feel inclined
- At the top, try to set a scene, show a pattern or break news with a stunning revelation
- Explain to the reader why your story/findings are relevant to your subject. Your
findings become nut grafs (If you can’t explain, you may have a hole in your reporting)
- For the body of the story, chronology is often a good writing device for pieces that
explore an episode in your subject’s history. Your timeline will come in handy here
- Sprinkle the small but illustrative details throughout
Bulletproofing
- Go back to your sources and double-check everything. Think about context.
- Re-read your documents to challenge any assertions or reporting holes
- Make the subject aware of your findings. You want them to respond before publication
- Review your story word-by-word, attaching each fact or number to a source. Consider
footnoting each fact in your article, when there is time to do so.
- Cut details that you don’t have 100% nailed down
