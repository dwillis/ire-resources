Presentation as Storytelling Tool - NICAR14 // Speaker Deck

Published March 1, 2014 in Design
User-centric design is key to attracting attention, keeping the public engaged and even getting people to do
what you ask of them.
Helene Sears of BBC Visual Journalism, Aron Pilhofer of The New York Times, and Alyson Hurt of NPR
share insights into their processes, along with case studies and resources for creating informative and
beautifully designed stories.
This deck was presented at the 2014 National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting conference
(NICAR14), and moderated by Chrys Wu of The New York Times.
