COLLECTING
EVIDENCE
When You Get The Video of Incident

audio and video

• Compare speech on video with written
statements
• Look for inconsistencies in audio recordings of
correctional officers
– (are they saying the same thing?)

• Determine roles and subordinate roles in video
• Look for excessive shaking, panning, zooming and
time stamp on video
– (video focusing on the wall could be a deliberately taught
tactic to hide what is really going on)

3. COLLECTING
EVIDENCE
Written Reports

written reports

• Should include color photographs of incident
• Supervisor’s report should describe 5 W’s/how
• Role of supervisor is to make sure all written
statements are matching
– ask for pre-reports/addendums and final report
– ask if report has been edited

3. COLLECTING
EVIDENCE
Tone of Investigation

tone of the investigation

• Look for pre-determined outcomes
• Look at how closely evidence is treated,
tagged and examined
• Review medical findings and compare with
physical notations made by investigator to
match wounds, injuries etc.
