But first …
• There are no value judgments here about whether specific
regulatory rollbacks, or de-regulation in general, is good
policy or bad.
• The real value judgment is that very often, de-regulation is
a story, and that wonky decisions in Washington are ready
to be brought to life on Main Street.
• “Consumer” is broadly defined here. It includes anyone
who buys or consumes any product or service or expects
well-being and safety as they participate in the economy.
