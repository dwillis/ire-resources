Why do I care about databases?
o Get a bird’s eye view of a lot of information.
o Determine some hard statistics.
o They’re sortable. You’ll be able to say “this is the worst” and “this is the
best” with confidence.
o Make more $$$.
How do I learn?
o NICAR at U. of Missouri teaches CAR boot camps several times a year
and also does traveling training sessions for Excel and Access.
o Attend a CAR bootcamp this weekend.
o Make friends with someone who knows how to use databases at your
organization.
o Teach yourself.
Database software
o Excel. For analyzing single tables of data, nothing beats Excel.
o Access. Step it up a notch. Work with multiple tables and larger data sets.
o SQL Server / MySQL.
 The SQL in both these application titles stands for “structured
query language”.
 Ask your database complex questions (called “queries”) to perform
data analysis.
 Put your data on the web for readers and reporters.
Building databases
o Always remember to break apart different pieces of information
o Add unique identifiers to each line of data
o Use codes instead of words
o This is bad:
Name / Title
Address
Robert J Barry, Reporter 1 Herald Plaza, Miami, FL 33132

o This is good:
Last First Middle Title
Street
City State ZIP
Barry Robert J
Reporter 1 Herald Plz Miami FL
33132

o This is best:
ID # Last First Middle Title
1 Barry Robert J
R

FOIAing databases
o If you’re not making your own database, you’ll most likely be working
with one provided by a government agency.
o Often, PIOs don’t know what you’re talking about when you ask for a
database. They can’t fathom the idea of looking at a million pieces of
information in a single lifetime, much less on deadline.
o Shortcut: Make friends with the local government IT staff. They can be
very helpful, and generally, they don’t care about politics.
