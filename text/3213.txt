Mapping Hazardous Chemical Sites
By Michael Grabell, ProPublica
NICAR Conference – Indianapolis -- 3/21/09

Key Data
EPA Risk Management Plan Database - http://www.epa.gov/oem/content/rmp/
The database includes only the plants and warehouses with the most toxic chemicals, such as
chlorine gas and anhydrous ammonia, and those with large quantities of other chemicals. You’ll
have to FOIA for it, but you can specify your state or county.
State Tier II Chemical Reporting Database
These databases include nearly all facilities with hazardous materials. Googling “Tier II
chemical reporting” and your state should tell you what you need to get the database.
Fire Department Hazmat Database
Don’t forget your local hazmat squad. Your fire department might keep their own database with
more information to prepare firefighters going out to a scene.
Mapping Software
ESRI ArcGIS – Allows for deep analysis, such as which communities and demographics tend to
live near hazmat facilities and which site has the most schools around it.
Google Maps/Caspio – Allows for more appealing Web presentation and searching.
Google Earth and Streetview – Don’t forget these tools. They gave me an overview and streetlevel view of a neighborhood so I could pinpoint the best places to report before I went out.
Supporting Material
EPA Risk Management Plans - The plans filed by plants and warehouses themselves provide
critical data, such as the maximum amount of each chemical they have on site and what safety
mechanisms are in place. Most important, they include worst-case scenarios that include the
radius and number of people that could be affected if all the chemicals released at once. After
9/11, the reports were restricted, but you can still obtain them at your local EPA Reading Room:

-OSHA Inspection Records - http://www.osha.gov/pls/imis/establishment.html
-EPA Enforcement Records - http://www.epa-echo.gov/echo/
-Fire Inspections – Is the plant in compliance or did inspectors find violations?
Zoning Cases & Planning Studies – Once you know where the plants are and the risks they
pose, it’s interesting to look at why and how they located there. In our series, many plants were
there before the neighborhood or school. The story was in why and how the neighborhood or
school was built so close to the industrial plants and warehouses.
