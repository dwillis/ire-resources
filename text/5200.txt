STORY CRAFT by Jack Hart
‘A general contractor doesn’t
just start building … He consults
his blueprint … as he
methodically works his way
toward the finished structure
depicted in his drawing. The
most confused, anxious, and
unproductive narrative writers
work like contractors without
blueprints.’

Doodles and other ways of visualizing...
‘John McPhee, the master of
nonfiction explanatory narrative,
obsesses on structure, in part
because sketching out a simple
blueprint helps him find his way
through the thickets of
information that sprout as he
reports a story.’
--Jack Hart

Visualizing the pieces

Tools of the trade...
• Lovelady sentence (25 words or less)
• Outlines (project, story)
• Timelines and chronologies
• Minimums/Maximums
• Key themes and storylines
• Story structure: chronological or thematic
• Project structure: narrative, series, rolling investigation
• Non-linear story-telling elements (data viz, video, photos, etc.)
• Memos, write as you go

We don’t really multitask
•Researchers call it task switching
•It takes more time to get tasks completed if you switch
between them than if you do them one at a time.
• You make more errors when you switch than if you do one
task at a time.
• If the tasks are complex then these time and error penalties
increase.

On average, we switch tasks every 11 seconds

Tools for better brain use
• Do your most brain intensive task first thing before checking email,
Twitter, Facebook
• Turn off notifications
• Pomodoro technique – Do a focused task for 25 minutes and nothing
else. Then take a break
• Split up your time between analytical tasks and creative tasks
• Change positions, use brain breaks – such as puzzles
• Draw first thing in the morning

Like writing, you can learn how to draw
