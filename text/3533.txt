¾Just because you

have all the
numbers, doesn’t mean you have to
put it all out there
¾It’s even more tempting when we can
put data online
¾Choose the number(s) that best
illustrates the story you want to tell

Salary data
¾ In Ontario, journalists can download salary
data for public sector workers who earn more
than $100-thousand a year
¾ There was a listserv debate about what to do
about salary data: how much of it should we
put on line? Does the public have a right to
know what people make
¾ Interesting debate, but misses an important
point
¾

There was little discussion about the stories
that we want to tell, using data that many
people may be seeing for the first time
¾ There’s a need to get beyond who made the
most and how many people are on the list. If
people want that, create a searchable database
that makes it easy to find the information and
bring traffic to your website.
¾ It’s more interesting to look for trends, and
other stories that would be impossible without
the data

Ontario’s public sector salary disclosure leads
to many perfunctory stories each year.
¾ Here’s one lead:
¾

TORONTO - The number of top earners in Ontario's
public sector rose 24% last year, according to
documents released yesterday.
In total, 42,527 employees earned more than
$100,000 in 2007. That number represents an
increase of 8,106 -- or nearly one-quarter --from one
year earlier.
The top earner in the province was Paul Haggis, CEO
of OMERS (Ontario Municipal Employees
Retirement System). Haggis earned $2.24-million in
2007 as well as about $10,000 in taxable benefits.

TORONTO - The number of $100,000-plus earners
at Ottawa City Hall dropped substantially last year,
bucking a provincial trend that saw nearly 25 per cent
more civil servants making more than $100,000 in
2007.
In Ottawa, 195 city employees broke the $100,000
threshold in 2007, 45 fewer than one year earlier,
according to provincial data released yesterday. That
represents a 19-per-cent drop.

The number of Ontario nurses making $100,000 and
up is almost eight times higher than it was five years
ago, thanks to larger expectations of overtime in the
profession, documents released by Ontario's Ministry
of Finance reveal.
In 2003, slightly more than 100 nurses made the
"sunshine list" of public sector employees earning
more than $100,000, while the latest counts 854
Names.

Crunching the numbers helps tell us what
¾ But it doesn’t tell us why
¾ The “what” of the nursing story is that there
are more of them on the list compared to the
previous year.
¾ The “why” is that they’re working more
overtime due to a nursing shortage
¾ That begs for a follow and some accountability,
making superior than previous treatments
¾

Under pressure to produce nurses more quickly, the
University of Ottawa is allowing students who
already have a degree to cut short their time in
nursing school.
Starting next month, students with at least an
undergraduate degree and six credits of human
anatomy and physiology will see their nursing
training shortened to two years from four.

Comparing the increases of the highest earners
to regular staff
¾ Create a pivot table of the top earners’ salaries
for a five-year period, or something close
¾ Find the collective agreement that provides the
increases for the rest of the staff
¾ Do a straight comparison
¾

The top earners at Algonquin college earned an
average increase of 26.7% between 2005 and
2008
 According to the collective agreement, regular
staff had an average increase of 14.89% during
the same time period
 Doing the math demonstrates that the average
increase of the top-salaried was almost twice as
high. This is a better headline.


The average salary increase from 2005-2008 for
the highest-paid staff at Algonquin College
was 26.67%
 The average salary increase for the same period
for workers earning less than
$-100,000
was 14.89% percent
 Headline: From 2005-2008, the salaries of
Algonquin’s highest-paid earners increased almost
twice as fast as the rate earned by the lowest-paid
officials.

Use CAR to go the extra mail: Find a reason to
use your spreadsheet; crack a pdf; ask for data;
download a shape file
 If you’re doing a story on possible cuts to
government programs, find out who keeps
track of program spending for the past few
years.
 If an organization produces an annual report,
find out what stats they keep. For instance, the
military tracks who gets charged for what.


The military, social agencies, health agencies,
labor bureaus, hospitals, publicly traded
companies, charities, etc, all produce annual
reports that contain charts and numbers
 What trends can we discover in combining a
number of those annual reports, and how can
we tell our audience the why of the story?

OTTAWA — A seven-year veteran of the Canadian Forces will
appear in Pembroke Provincial Court today after being charged in
connection with four sexual assaults in the CFB Petawawa area.
Cpl. Christopher Raymond Chaulk was charged Sunday under the
Criminal Code with four counts of sexual assault and four related
counts of assault.
The charges stem from two incidents on the base in the early
mornings of May 6 and May 8, and two others in the CFB
Petawawa area in the fall of 2009.
The charges came one day after Chaulk was arrested by the
Canadian Forces National Investigation Service, the investigative
arm of the Canadian Forces Military Police.

The United States has launched an investigation into allegations that
American soldiers were responsible for the "unlawful deaths" of at least
three Afghan civilians, the U.S. military said Thursday.
"There are also allegations of illegal drug use, assault and conspiracy,"
the military said, and although no charges have been laid, one soldier
is in pre-trial confinement.
The U. S. has been criticized by rights groups and Afghans for
allegedly maltreating civilians and torturing prisoners.
The U.S. army's criminal investigation command began an
investigation after receiving information from
the soldiers' unit.

On 20 June 2007, ex-Ordinary Seaman Ellis approached the
CFNIS (The Canadian Forces National Investigation Service)
undercover operator (UCO) and said, "Hey, you're Lee's friend,
and that is the only reason we are talking."
“Ex-Ordinary Seaman Ellis told the UCO that he could get 2
grams of cocaine for $100 or an eight-ball for $160. Ex-Ordinary
Seaman Ellis also told the UCO that he is the only guy in Nelles
Block selling drugs, and that he deals to six other people in the
quarters. The UCO then gave ex-Ordinary Seaman Ellis $100 for
2 grams of cocaine.”
“At 2333 hours, ex-Ordinary Seaman Ellis gave the UCO one
small clear plastic bag containing cocaine.”

Two days later, “the UCO asked to buy some more, this time an ‘eight
ball’ or about 3.5 grams of cocaine.” The price? Between $160 and $180.
A few hours later, “Ellis slid a ‘baggy’ of cocaine under the UCO’s
door.”
This was not Ellis’ first brush with trouble. In 2007, he was nabbed for
being absent without leave. Ellis testified that he had a four-year old
son who was living with his ex-wife, and that he was addicted to
cocaine and sold it for “personal gain.”
He described Esquimalt, the base where he was stationed at the time,
as a “drug environment,” and claimed he only started using coke when
he arrived there.
But even before Ellis got into trouble, the military was issuing
warnings about drug use and drug trafficking within its ranks.



The what of the story is beefed up with the
story of Ex-ordinary seaman Ellis.
The why of the story is why was the military
conducting a sting operation in the first place
And why did Ex-ordinary seaman C.A.E. Ellis
claim that he never had a drug problem until
he arrived at the base in British Columbia?

Read annual reports in which institutions
summarize information such as how much
they earn, who got penalized the most, who got
charged the most, etc
 Get budgets in Excel format, and if you get a
pdf, crack it!
 Use the Census bureau to get beyond the
summary tables
 Whenever you see a summary table online, ask
for the raw data set


Never forget we are telling stories, the numbers
are just a means to that end
 Ex-Ordinary Seaman C.A.E. Ellis was jailed for
seven months
 Choose a number that you want people to
remember
 Use numbers in as conversational a way as
possible, instead of saying that something
increased by 100 percent, say it doubled
 Collect a data library and update it for contextual
stories once institutions release their reports and
statistics.


GOOD LUCK!!
