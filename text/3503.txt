Sources and Shortcuts:
*Get to know people outside the usual arena.
*Consumer Attorneys-Get acquainted with at least two in your market. These people can
be great sources of information. They can also turn you on to victims and are often
willing to share their “evidence” for your broll needs.
*Liquidators-When a con man gets caught it’s often the liquidator who sells off his cars
and jewels bought with victims’ money. There may be one in your market who gets the
jobs of selling the goods.
*Skype-With cost cutting measures being what they are bosses are not as willing as they
once were to shell out money for satellite interviews and phoners are no fun. Skype is a
cheap and easy resource. Professionals usually have access to it.
*Skip the PIO and go straight to the Economic Crimes Division –
Most law enforcement agencies have one of these units. These guys are sometimes
willing to share cases they are working on as they often need your help in getting more
victims to build their case.
*Team up and expand your reach-Make the most of your resources and cut down on the
cost of your story by working with other stations owned by your company and affiliated
with your network. Scripps stations are great at this and have exposed national issues
such as taser malfunctions to the fat in low fat menus.
*Consumer Advocacy Gold-Consumer advocacy groups can be a valuable resource.
They are tracking everything from changes in sinkhole insurance to which law makers
are behind bills that would cut funding to your local consumer protection agency.

Locksmith Rip-off-Find out if you local consumer protection
agency has any complaints. These guys sometimes list bogus
local addresses and phone numbers that are not local but route
to a call center in another state. They perform a classic bait
and switch, quoting one price then charging double or triple
after they unlock your door. Great under cover video
opportunity.
Negotiating down your credit card rate. We’ve done this story
twice and it is one of the biggest hits on our website to date.
You give people script on negotiating down their interest rate
