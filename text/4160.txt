Key questions:

What are current federal policies/programs that promote integration? (Hint, not many) And is your
district implementing or participating in them?
Does your state or school district have explicit policies to ensure or promote integration?
If your district isn’t under a court order, it is under a voluntary plan with the U.S. Department of
Education?
If the answer to the last two is yes, then how is your district complying?
Where to look:
1) Zoning and reassignment
2) School siting
3) Choice policies
4) Transfer policies
5) Talented and gifted, special programs

Test the premise of separate but equal:
1) Teacher quality: tenure, experienced, degrees, National Board certifications)
2) Curriculum
3) Funding
4) Extracurricular offerings: sports, yearbook, newspapers clubs

5) Teacher turnover
6) Art, music, field trips, dance
