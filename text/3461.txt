(More than 5) databases for criminal justice reporting

5 Databases in 50 Minutes: Crime

The criminal justice beat can be one of the most data-rich beats in a newsroom. Information is stored
electronically at all stages of the legal process -- from arrest to sentencing to imprisonment. That’s the good
news. The bad news is that journalists in pursuit of a specific story often find the data trail fragmented
among different criminal justice agencies and jurisdictions. And the data stored by these different agencies
often don’t speak well to one another.
This handout should give you an idea of where to start asking for data. If you intend to dig deep on a
criminal justice story, brace yourself for the possibility that the story won’t be doable with data alone. Expect
to spend some time in musty court morgues pulling files to verify that your database queries are yielding
valid results or to plug holes because information is missing from the data files.

Crime on the streets: Incident-level and arrest data
Police incident data, 911 response data, arrest data
This should be a staple in any newsroom covering crime in the community. This data can be a bear to get,
however, because local law enforcement agencies often are loathe to share it with the press. Be prepared
for resistance and a long battle for access, but fight the fight. These data show where crime is happening
in your community and can inform the spot news story as well as help you analyze long-term trends.
Jail bookings
Check with the local jurisdiction, but also find out if bookings are reported to the state. In Minnesota, for
example, the state Department of Corrections compiles bookings records from the counties, and
journalists fought successfully for access to the statewide file. A cautionary note: A jail booking does not
always result in a charged offense.
Blood-alcohol test results
The Charlotte Observer obtained blood-alcohol test results from the N.C. Department of Health and
Human Services and reporters were able to match the records to court data to analyze how test results
affected a defendant’s outcome in court.

Courts and sentencing
Court case history

Civil and criminal dockets

Case information/management systems
In all cases, look for a central source of this data, for both the lower and appellate courts. Some states
have an Administrative Office of the Courts. Sometimes, the state Supreme Court is the repository for
this data. For federal cases, try Pacer, http://pacer.psc.uscourts.gov/. Rarely, will one data source
contain all of the information you seek. Expect problems, including:




How is a charge recorded? Is it the original charging offense? Is it the sentencing offense?
Which do you need for the story you want to write?
Do you have all of the pieces you need to link the database with other data sources? Full
name? Date of birth? Case numbers?
Does the database contain the full universe? If it purports to include all criminal convictions, for
example, ask if it includes criminal misdemeanors.

Jury cards and jury-selection transcripts
Reporters have used these records to analyze the racial makeup and other demographics of juries.
State Sentencing Commissions
These are policy-making bodies, which set sentencing guidelines. Because their function is to analyze
sentencing trends and recommend improvements, they can be a good source of historic data. The
National Association of State Sentencing Commissions maintains a list of them here:

State conviction files
States maintain convictions databases to allow landlords, employers and others to do background checks.
Find out who maintains this database and ask for a copy. Be sure to ask what, if any, records are missing
from the file.
State criminal justice statistics centers, legislative research offices
Who is charged with collecting, analyzing and reporting statistical data about crime and the courts in your
state? In New York, for example, this duty falls to the Division of Criminal Justice Services,
http://criminaljustice.state.ny.us.
U.S. Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Statistics
http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/index.cfm?ty=dca
Any reporter who plans to write about sentencing trends should start with a spin through this page. If you
see a data collection that interests you, check the National Archive of Criminal Justice Data to see if it is
available for download.
National Archive of Criminal Justice Data
http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/NACJD/
NACJD is one of the special topics archives at the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social
Research (ICPSR) at the University of Michigan. It is the repository for numerous data sets collected by
the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics and is a good starting point when seeking criminal justice data.

Imprisonment and probation
Imprisoned and supervised offenders
Your state Department of Corrections should have a database of both imprisoned offenders and offenders
on supervised release. In many states, this data is searchable online. Try to get this going back a number
of years. Probation offices in individual jurisdictions should have data, too.
National Corrections Reporting Program
http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/NACJD/ncrp/
This program tracks almost all prisoner admissions and releases. It is an inmate-level data set that
includes basic demographics (age, gender, race, Hispanic origin), offense codes and sentencing
information. The records include the admitting or releasing state and the sentencing county. Typically, 38
states and the federal prisons participate in the program, accounting for an estimated 90 percent of all
prisoners. Annual files are available as far back as 1983.
The NCRP is not a complete census of the prison population. Rather, it is a look at prisoners’ flow in and
out of the prison system, year by year. The data set is most valuable for national-level analysis and is
most reliable from the late 1980s onward. The BJS advises caution in using the NCRP for state-by-state
comparisons, because of variations in the way states report. If you plan to use this dataset, careful study
of the codebook is essential, with particular attention to the explanatory notes, which outline differences in
state reporting practices for each variable. For time-series analysis, beware of changes in the file layout
from year to year, changes in coding of the variables, and states that drop out and reappear from year to
year. I’d advise you to find an expert at the BJS to help you find the potential land mines.
National Judicial Reporting Program
http://webapp.icpsr.umich.edu/cocoon/NACJD-SERIES/00077.xml
This is a survey program covering 300 counties. Conducted every two years, the survey collects
demographic information on felons, conviction offenses, sentence types, sentence lengths, and time from
arrest to conviction and sentencing. NACJD has data available for download as far back as 1986.
Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities
http://webapp.icpsr.umich.edu/cocoon/NACJD/SERIES/00070.xml
Conducted by the Census Bureau every five to seven years, this survey is the most detailed information
available about U.S. prisoners. Survey topics include offense and sentencing information, criminal history,
family background and personal characteristics, prior drug and alcohol use, gun possession and use,
gang membership and prison activities, programs and services.
