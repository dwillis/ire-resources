Securing Workstations and
Personal Data
Neena Kapur

Dark Web vs Deep Web

What’s the difference?
Deep Web:

Dark Web:

Anything that a search
engine cannot find!

A subsection of the deep
web that is intentionally
hidden and not accessible
through standard browsers.

What are the risks?

● Compromised device, leading to possible compromise of other devices in
network
● Compromised personal data, which could lead to targeted online attacks
● Revealing sources
● Law enforcement/government misinterpretation

Ask yourself three questions

If...
● Your computer is seized or compromised, what would be on it?
● A dark web forum, marketplace, or actor is taken down by law
enforcement, what information is linked back to you?
● Your dark web account was compromised by another actor, what
could they find out about you?

Securing your workstation

The Dirty Computer
● Use a separate device for research
● No ties to organizational information
○ MiFi for Internet/work at a coffee shop!
○

Gift cards for purchasing things (AV products, software, VM)

● When possible, keep research and production separate
○

One device for research, another device for production

○

Use encrypted USBs to securely store and transfer data

Securing your data

Separate Accounts
● Create separate accounts for use on your dirty computer (email, Twitter,
etc.)
● Set up inconspicuous accounts
○

Non-unique handles and email addresses

● Even throw-away accounts can get hacked!
○

Complex, unique passwords passwords

○

2FA (using burner phone)

Browse Securely
●

Tor (Margot will talk more about this)
○

Extra level of security when browsing - conceals your real IP address

● Secure Operating Systems
○

Tails - a secure operating system that can be used from a DVD or USB - protects privacy,
circumvents censorship

● Virtual Private Networks (VPN)
○

Further mask your IP address, if already using Tor

● Always sanitize any file you receive from communications on the deep/
dark web
● Be cautious about what personal information (if any) you divulge about
yourself. Depending on who you are talking to, it could be used against you.
● Lawyers are your friends - consult with your organization’s attorneys if you
have hesitations about engaging with certain actors or forums to
understand the risks
● Know the actors who you choose to communicate with, and understand
what tactics they use.
