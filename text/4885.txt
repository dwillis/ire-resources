Investigating academic fraud in college sports – an IRE2016 tipsheet
Covering higher education brings unique challenges that require creative, resourceful journalism. Colleges are
led by bright people with limited oversight, and protected by powerful boosters in government and
commerce. Privacy laws work against you. Fans are ready to crucify you. Here are some ways to find academic
fraud and other grade shenanigans behind those ivy-covered walls.

Majors. Are athletes (especially revenue sports) clustering around a particular major? If so, try to identify which
classes and professors are popular among athletes within those majors.
Priority registration. Many colleges give athletes advanced registration so they can access classes that don’t
interfere with their practice and game schedules. As a result, they will report those classes that have high (I’ve
seen 20 percent or more) registrations of athletes. See if you can get average grades for those classes.
Particularly look for the ones that are obscure or arcane.
Summer registrations. Many athletes stay on campus during the summer. Since this is a light enrollment period,
priority registrations aren’t necessary. A list of athlete registrations and grades might point to problem classes.
‘Easy’ class lists/correspondence. A records request to the athletes’ tutoring programs might turn up evidence
of easy classes made available to athletes. Check that info with enrollment data to see how often athletes are
using them.
Independent studies. Get them by academic department or by team if possible. Michigan, Auburn and UNC
handed these out like candy. Professors really can only handle a few a semester.
Tutoring correspondence. If you’ve identified a professor handing out high grades to athletes, make a
correspondence request of his/her email (and department staff email) with athlete tutoring programs. You may
find improper course coordination, suggested grades, plagiarized papers.
Athlete transcripts. Just one opened the door to the UNC scandal. Ask current/former athletes if you can view
their transcripts. The records may turn up in checks at public agencies (and they ARE public records outside of
the colleges). Develop sources among faculty and staff who might be willing to provide grade/class/professor
information.
NCAA correspondence. A must if you want to know if a school is in trouble. It can also show cozy relationships
between the NCAA and college athletic officials. Make this a standing request.
Accreditation correspondence. Colleges have to be accredited at least every few years to receive federal
student aid. Accrediting commissions tend to look more at processes than outcomes, but they will have to deal
with academic fraud allegations.
Honor rolls. Worth looking at to see how many honor students are in the revenue sports and who they are.
Google ‘Rashad McCants’ and ‘dean’s list’ to see what I mean.
Professor rating sites. An unidentified student unknowingly outed one of the UNC fake classes on Koofers.com.
If you’ve got a suspect professor, these sites have info on average grades and student comments.
College websites. Incredible as it seems, UNC’s had a real transcript there of a popular athlete. It also had
registration data that pointed to fake classes. Athlete rosters are helpful too.
Minutes and correspondence for faculty athletic committees. Particularly the one handling special admissions
of athletes who are far below the academic profile. The motive for cheating starts there.

Some of the key people who can help you are current/former faculty and administrators who have demonstrated
an interest in protecting academic integrity and/or are wary of college sports; former academic advisors, tutors or
learning specialists for athletes; former and current athletes if you can get them to talk about their classes and
professors. Students and alums sometimes know more than they realize if you ask the right questions.
