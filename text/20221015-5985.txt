criminal justice
system

Incarceration rates for LGB people are 3X higher than

For transgender people, it’s even higher. 1/6 transgender
people have been to prison.
LGBT inmates are more likely to be sexually assaulted,
to receive extreme punishment, or to be discriminated
against, than straight inmates.
