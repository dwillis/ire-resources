• A series that focused on the rising costs of drugs and those who are affected. The

series focused on those with high deductible healthcare plans who pay the full price
of drugs at the pharmacy counter, and those people with insurance who are still
getting a bad deal because Pharmacy Benefit Managers charge their insurance more
for certain drugs – sometimes more than the cash price of drugs without insurance.
• The series looked at the pharmaceutical supply chain – how RX drugs are getting
more and more expensive at every step, and how massive companies, particularly
PBMs are raking in huge profits. It also examined the pharmaceutical industry’s
influence in Washington through lobbying and campaign contributions, and the
power of marketing on television and through payments to doctors.
