Profiling investigators in
powerful public agencies.
You need to understand how the people
you are going up against work.

Investigate every person involved,
because it provides a window into
identity, motivation, and veracity.
Seek out defense attorneys who
may know about the investigator
you’re investigating from previous
court cases.
Seek out and find video depositions

•

Study grand jury transcripts in as many
cases as you can.
What makes them tick? Look for
attitude and arrogant behaviors (not
afraid to tell you how great they are).
Study behavior under oath.

•

See if they are respectful, defiant,
adamant or evasive, i.e. “I have no
recollection.” “I can’t remember.”
Find out where they live, what they
drive, what they like to do when
they’re not working.
Voter registrations, dog, fishing
and hunting licenses tell us much

If you find nothing but
honor and glory, they are
not predisposed to
someone coming at them
with a critical eye.
Goal is to find out who you
are really dealing with and
capitalize on that when you
finally get to talk to them.
