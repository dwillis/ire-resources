supplemental ﬁlings
There are many government agencies with regulatory authority
over nonproﬁts.
Each may have supplemental information such as
warning letters, revocation letters, annual ﬁnancial statements,
correspondence and more.
Yet oversight differs between states.
To ﬁnd yours, Google:
“[your state]” + “charities” + site:.gov
