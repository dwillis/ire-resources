Dear open-records administrator:
Under the Texas Public Information Act, I'd like to request [Fill in record here].
Specifically, I’m seeking a spreadsheet, database or delimited text file (s) – not paper records or a PDF
created from data with the following fields:
[fields go here]
If you cannot produce all of these fields, please let us know instead of denying the request in full. In
addition, please include any lookup tables that may be needed to interpret the data. We'll be happy to
join the records ourselves, rather than require your staff to do so.

I want to stress that I'm not seeking any records that are prohibited from release either by statute or
previous rulings by the Texas Attorney General or the courts. Please let me know if you feel any records
in the fields I've requested are confidential, and I'll consider amending my request.
Also, please let me know if clarifying the request might speed the release of the data, reduce any
programming time and, most important, avoid a referral to the Attorney General.
We're comfortable working with large data sets and can receive the records in a variety of formats (.dbf,
.csv, .mdb, etc) and media (CD, DVD, ftp).
I seek this information in the public interest as a journalist, and not for a commercial purpose.
Therefore, I'm requesting that you waive any fees, as allowed under the Act. If this is not possible,
please provide a detailed list that breaks down each charge that equals the total amount.

Thank you again for your time. Let me know if you have any questions.

Regards,
