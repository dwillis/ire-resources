Stand Your Ground
Trayvon
Martin’s
death
touched off
a fire storm.

Was Trayvon an outlier?
Reporters from
across the country
were in Sanford.
Everyone was
digging into
Zimmerman and
Martin. But some
bigger questions
were wide open.

Instead of Trayvon, we
focused on the law.

We used a basic reporting
tool – we surveyed the data.

Finding and surveying cases
We assigned 6 people full time
for almost 3 months and used 3
part-time researchers.

Gather
the
data

We found more than 225 cases
involving nearly 500 people.

We spent thousands of dollars
on background checks for
everyone involved in a SYG
case.

Analyze
it

We determined the outcome of
each case and the race of all
involved.
We asked readers to share
more cases and added those to
our data.

The results
The number of cases is increasing, largely because "stand your ground" has been
used in ways state legislators never envisioned. The defense has been invoked by a
self-described "vampire" in Pinellas County, a Miami man arrested with a single
marijuana cigarette, a Fort Myers homeowner who shot a bear and a West Palm
Beach jogger who beat a Jack Russell terrier.
People often go free under "stand your ground" in cases that seem to make a mockery
of what lawmakers intended. One man killed two unarmed people and walked out of
jail. Another shot a man as he lay on the ground. Others went free after shooting their
victims in the back.
Similar cases can have opposite outcomes. Depending on who decided their cases,
some drug dealers claiming self-defense have gone to prison while others have been
set free. The same holds true for killers who left a fight, only to arm themselves and
return. Shoot someone from your doorway? Fire on a fleeing burglar? Your case can
swing on different interpretations of the law by prosecutors, judge or jury.

Race’s complex role
Black victim – 73 percent walked free. White victim
– 59 percent.

Whites charged at the same rate as blacks.

Whites convicted at the same rate as blacks.
Similar outcomes in fatal mixed-race cases. Four of
the five blacks who killed a white went free; five of
the six whites who killed a black went free.
Black defendants went free 66 percent vs 61
percent for white defendants.
