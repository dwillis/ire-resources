o Alerts available for developments i.e. modified terms, contract award announcements
Solicitations of interest
o Interested parties are visible
Can search by agency issuing contract or geographic location
Watch for mid-competition changes in scope, expectations, contract value
Limitations: Only archived for a year
o End-arounds
 Internet Archive
 FOIA
 Contact awarding contract officer, whose email is available in FBO data
On rare occasion, rebids that revoke an original decision

FEDERAL PROCUREMENT DATABASE SYSTEM: https://www.fpds.gov



Full picture of a contractor’s history working for the government and individual contract detail
Dollar amounts, modifications and extensions
Contract clusters in National Interest Actions, i.e. contracts associated with a particular natural
disaster
Bulk information i.e. the top 100 contractors employed each year searchable by department
o Though imperfect, a lot of experts still find it to be the most accurate, readily available
source of this information
Subtle red flags to watch for



o Indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ): More susceptible to abuse/fraud
o Sole source: Can favor a single bidder
Limitations: Subcontracts
o End-arounds: FOIA contractor’s submissions for reimbursement and government
rejections; reports generated funded under a particular contract that identify the
contract

Often gives fairly descriptive details of untoward details about contract awards.
It’s a strong backgrounding tool to examine a contractor’s less flattering history.
o Sometimes reveals details of contractors’ past missteps and performance lapses.
Gives you names of contacts on all sides, which an open the door to useful conversations.
Limitations: The reports reflect facts agreed to by lawyers on all sides, so deficiencies can be
understated.
o End-around: Nudge lawyers from the opposing side to steer you toward more damning
records about a contractor, most likely as a background conversation.
STORY EXAMPLE: “Trump administration’s planned nuclear upgrade is being undermined by cost
overruns” by Center for Public Integrity

Financial disclosures show political appointees’ financial interests, including investments and
moneymaking roles with corporations.
o Value: Signals where favors may be given and what conflicts of interest to watch for
during the appointee’s service.
STORY EXAMPLE: “Trump administration financial disclosures” by ProPublica
o https://www.propublica.org/datastore/dataset/trump-administration-financialdisclosures
For regional reporters, your state’s financial disclosure requirements of lawmakers and others
can serve this same purpose.
Local and regional reporters could find some equivalent data in conflict of interest disclosures
(or lack thereof) during governing board votes.
STORY EXAMPLE: “Find your state legislators’ financial interests” by Center for Public Integrity

Audits: Your state’s legislative audit committee or the equivalent

CONTRACT PERFORMANCE MEASURES




Example: National Nuclear Security Administration
o Performance expectations plans, performance evaluation reports, fee (bonus) award
letters.
STORY EXAMPLE: “Light penalties and lax oversight encourage weak safety culture at nuclear
weapon labs” by Center for Public Integrity

State/local spending records
o Request a contractor’s receipts submitted to the government and government
payments to the contractor

New Mexican

communication systems” by Center for Public Integrity

STORY EXAMPLE: “Nuclear weapons contractor to pay millions for misuse of federal
funds” by Center for Public Integrity
 https://www.publicintegrity.org/2015/08/24/17892/nuclear-weaponscontractor-pay-millions-misuse-federal-funds

diverting federal funds” by Center for Public integrity

DISQUALIFICATIONS AND DEBARMENTS




Searching SAM: https://www.dol.gov/ofccp/regs/compliance/preaward/debarlst.htm
o Limitations: Most federal agencies have ephemeral records of contractor discipline
which render suspensions invisible when they’re completed.
 End-around: FOIA bygone time periods.
Most states maintain their own lists of debarred contractors prohibited from working for the
government.

LOBBYING RECORDS






House and Senate lobbying disclosures: http://disclosures.house.gov/ld/ldsearch.aspx
o Generally rely on the House; Senate submissions are on paper and delayed.
o Alternately, the aggregated, speedy option is the Center for Responsive Politics
 http://www.opensecrets.org/
 When you use this or any other aggregated data source, always attribute
What initiatives or proposals did a contractor support?
o What specific monetary interests were they protecting?
o Who sided with them and delivered their message in the decision-making process?
At the state level, this data is generally maintained by the Secretary of State’s Office

CAMPAIGN FINANCE






These records can illuminate which decision-makers have benefited from contracting firms and
why they might be motivated to support those companies’ interests.
Federal Election Commission: https://www.fec.gov/
In a hurry? http://www.opensecrets.org/
At the state level this data is generally maintained by the Secretary of State’s Office
At the county level this is usually available from county clerks.



At the local level, this is usually available from municipal clerks.

EVENTS PUT ON BY AND FOR CONTRACTORS



Statements to an audience perceived to be friendly, the speakers will make more candid
remarks and tell more audacious lies than they probably would to a reporter one-on-one.
Public officials’ attendance or participation can signal a cozy relationship with an industry or
individual contractors.

WHAT YOU’RE LOOKING FOR







Personal/financial relationships between public officials and companies benefiting from
government jobs.
Low accountability of contractors.
Suspicious timing of contractor payments or changes in expectations.
Indications of contractors exercising control over decisions or decision-makers in government.
Government decisions that benefit contractors at the expense of someone or something else.
Rewards to companies that show bias or favoritism.
o STORY EXAMPLE: “The man who seduced the 7th Fleet” by The Washington Post
 https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/investigative/2016/05/27/the-man-whoseduced-the-7th-fleet/?noredirect=on

CONCLUSION




These are all rocks to turn over in search of breadcrumbs.
Alone, they’ll seldom yield an entire story.
Paired with authoritative voices from interviews, they can provide rich details and expose
hidden influence.
