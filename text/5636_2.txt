Investigating transportation: Construction costs

The Michael Berens Checklist

And: Is there one key question to base the story around?

The FTA makes it easy

Go to the federal Transit Administration (FTA) at the U.S. Department of Transportation
(and to your local transportation agency); ask for the latest “Quarterly Review Report”

The NTD makes it even easier

Go to the National Transit Database (NTD) on the US Department of Transportation
site (https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd) and search for databases about “capital
expenses”

(A word about the NTD)

45 pages = 1,106 datasets

The industry makes it easier still

Go to https://www.nap.edu/read/14369/chapter/2

Another way to slice the data
•

The budget of almost every transit project (and every specific part of every project)
is made up of 3 key components:
• Labor
• Materials
• Soft costs

•

As a general rule, breakdown should be 40% labor, 40% materials, 20% soft costs

•

So get the numbers for your local project, and see how it stacks up

What to request from your local transit agency
•

The project’s latest Quarterly Review Report (as previously noted)

•

Any other reports made to feds, board of directors, city council, state lawmakers…

•

All contracts associated with the project

•

For each contract: The RFP, winning bid, losing bids, application scores, the criteria,
the judges, the negotiators, the people negotiating on behalf of the companies

•

Documentation of any background checks

•

A list of subcontractors (Look out for competitors who become subcontractors)

•

“CPM Schedules”

•

Breakdown of (regular and OT) hours worked on each part of project

•

All change orders requested by contractors (and the change order determinations)

•

Any protests filed in relation to the project (and the protest determinations)

•

Any internal reviews, audits or evaluations

Other key records
•

Other US DOT records (the Full Funding Grant Agreement, monthly reports, audits)

•

Collective Bargaining Agreements, or any other documents governing the labor
(Look at worker salaries, staffing rules and any required payments to the union)

•

Campaign donations by the unions, the contractors and the consultants (as well as
other signs of political support)

•

Hiring records about which unions/contractors/consultants have hired away
officials from your local transit agency

•

Accountability records: Have problems been found in past? (Yes, there they have;
there are always problems). Have people been actually held responsible? (If so,
what happened? If not, is that a sign of a lack of accountability?)

•

Data that can be used to control for variables in cost comparisons: Cost of living,
documentation of aspects of construction (track depth, station size, etc) and
general construction cost indexes

Sourcing tip: Talk to everybody

General tip: Go there to compare
