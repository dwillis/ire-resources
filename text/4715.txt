Threat Modeling
• Basically the who/what/where/when/why/
how of thinking about security & risk.
Some examples of Qs you might ask:

Why might you be targeted?
●
Who are your enemies?
●
What might be used against you?
●
What could go wrong in your day-to-day?
●
How secure do you need it?
●

Technical
• crypto
• hacking, intercepted communications, code-breaking
Legal
• legal protections
• lawsuits, subpoenas, detention
Social
• phishing, "social engineering," exploiting trust
Physical
• locks, security guards
• theft, network taps, torture
Operational
• how do you put the above into action?
• how do you go about your business?
• shit happens, do you have a backup plan?

Computers: How do they work?

Data at rest. What's on your computer? What's
sitting in your e-mail archive?

Data at rest. What's on your computer? What's
sitting in your e-mail archive?
Data in motion. Communication! Calls,
messages, files sent; anything out of your hands.

Tools and concepts
that can help

Look for your own
metadata footprint
●

Search yourself in “people finder” sites & optout of your data showing up:
●
https://crashoverridenetwork.tumblr.com/p
ost/108387569412/preventing-doxing

Software updates,
Antivirus/antispyware
Security holes in Windows, Mac, and Linux, are
discovered on a near-daily basis. Same with
browsers and most other software. (When it
annoys you to restart & update, just do it!)

Passwords
Don't use the same couple of passwords
everywhere.
Your e-mail password needs to be stronger than
your bank’s. (At least you can call up your bank
for help if there’s fraud. Not so much w/e-mail.)
E-mail owns your other accounts — nearly
every website has an “I forgot my password”
feature that e-mails you.

Passwords
An 8 letter password with numbers and symbols
can be cracked in a few days, but an 8 word
phrase could take centuries.
“Pass phrases” – use a real sentence instead of
just one word. Google and Twitter (& many
others) let you use a password as long as you
want!
Unfortunately, websites don't always let you do
this.

https://xkcd.com/936/

Password Managers
Helps you use a different password everywhere.
Can generate totally random passwords for
every website.
1Password (Mac/iOS/Windows)
LastPass (multiplatform, website)
KeePassX (multiplatform app)

Two Factor Login
• Helps keep an account secure, even if your
password is stolen.

• First factor: “something you know”
(your password)

• Second factor: “something you have”
(your phone)

• You (or an evildoer) need both to get into
your accounts.

• Google has it,Yahoo has it, Twitter, Facebook,
Dropbox, lots of banks.

Two Factor Login

Secure deletion
• When you delete a file from your computer,
you’re only deleting it from the “table of
contents” of your drive.

• Data still there until something else needs to use
those unused “pages.”

• A “secure” delete writes random data into the
place where the file was.

Secure deletion
●

Erasing files:
“Secure Empty Trash” on Mac:
hold ⌘ key when right-clicking Trash.
●
CCleaner (Windows)
●

●

Erasing free space (to wipe files that you didn’t
erase securely):
Disk Utility (Mac)
●
CCleaner (Windows)
●

File encryption
• Protects files
• Use case: sending sensitive files or putting
files on USB sticks to share.

• TrueCrypt (multiplatform)
• MiniLock (multiplatform)

Full disk encryption
• Protects all data on your computer, when
computer is turned off.

• Use case: Protects if computer is stolen
• Apple FileVault (Mac)
• BitLocker (Windows “Pro” or “Enterprise” versions)

But what about other
tools?
• New tools come out all the time.
• We don’t necessarily know what’s secure. Follow
a lot of security experts to see what their
consensus is.

• Consider the encryption, metadata-masking

capabilities, and transparency of how tools work:
