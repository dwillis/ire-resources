Intro and Overview -- new modes of communication = new challenges
A. “Private” accounts:
See, e.g. McLeod v. Parnell, 286 P.3d 509, 515 (Alaska 2012)
(“using private email accounts is no more an obstruction of access
to public records than communicating through paper letters”).

Tips from The Trenches

A. Requesting records


Try asking verbally. This can help put nervous agencies at ease and humanize your
request.



File a written request, even if it's not required or you were verbally assured you would
receive the records. This confirms that you're all on the same page and also establishes
a paper trail.



Time requests to regular reporting cycles.
o

In California, agencies can charge for producing records outside their typical
schedule. I've had agencies say if you want the records now we'll charge you
hundreds of dollars, but if you wait a couple months when we plan to do the work
anyway, it'll be free.

o

Timing is important for getting records while they must still be retained or while
they are still easily accessible (old data gets archived, systems get upgraded).



Specify file formats. Save everyone time and let agencies know right away that a PDF
or printout of an Excel spreadsheet is unacceptable. You have a right to access
electronic records in their original electronic format.



Ask for itemized work and fees up front. Show that you know the law and do not let
agencies charge you bogus records fees.
B. Talking tech



Get your hands-on training at IRE!



Understand an agency's data so you can call it out on unreasonable programming
charges. This also allows you to negotiate and modify your request.
o

What system is the data stored in? What programming language are you using?
Why will this take a million hours?



o

Is there an easier method or alternative? There are always multiple ways to get a
job done. Some are much, much slower than others.

o

Is some data more accessible than others? If you can't have X because it's
expensive and difficult to get, can you have Y easily for free instead?

Insist on specifics. Talk to the nerd who's going to pull the data for your request. Have
him or her describe the actual work that needs to be done. Do not settle for a
spokesperson telling you that emailing you a spreadsheet is 20 hours of "programming."
C. Finding workarounds, arguing denials



No response to your request? Ask someone else.
o



The legal department has decided to ignore you, but perhaps the payroll
department that has your records and will respond. Similarly, the FOIA officer
probably has no idea what records are available. Go to the IT nerd who manages
the database.

Are the records available somewhere else?
o

Have similar records been released before? Go to the person who released them
and to the person who received them.

o

For U.S. Federal District and Bankruptcy court records you would pay for on
PACER, use RECAP to see if they're already available for
free: https://www.recapthelaw.org/



Reporting chains. Agencies report to each other. You'll generally lose detail the higher
up you go, but records will also be more standardized. For example: Schools report to
school districts, which report to counties, which report to their states, which report to the
U.S. Department of Education.



Similar or related data. You want X, but you can't get it or it doesn't exist. Does Y help
you answer your question? For example: To quantify the number of bystanders shot by
police, The New York Times got compensation claims filed with the city
comptroller: http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/nyregion/bystanders-shot-by-policeface-uphill-fight-to-win-lawsuits.html



"No report containing the information you requested exists." Records exist
regardless of whether an agency has already compiled them.



"No records exists."



o

Ask: "Did you destroy the records?" More than once I have had agencies change
their response and acknowledge that the records do exist (they just don't really
want to do the work to retrieve them). When you establish that records exist, you
can talk tech and negotiate.

o

When you know records exist and an agency says they do not: Rephrase, refile,
appeal. Explicitly list what you want – not just the database's name, but the
actual fields in the database.

"We don't have to create a new record for you." Electronic records may require
programming for disclosure, just as paper documents may require photocopying. Writing
the necessary queries and scripts to extract or redact records is not creating new
records.

{00740442;v1}



Know the law. Cite court decisions and attorney general opinions. Denials must cite the
statutes that exempt records from disclosure. Look out for bogus citations that are
irrelevant to your request.



Be persistent! Agencies hope you forget about them. Set calendar reminders to followup, check in regularly. Use FOIA Machine (https://www.foiamachine.org) to manage your
requests.
