Six tips to help you dig deeper
Find the Unified Field Theory
Often, environmental controversies share a common element. By knowing how
something is supposed to work, you can find that common element. With Florida
development, the Unified Field Theory was wetlands permits.

Sometimes, you have to get the answer yourself
Dig deep enough, or ask a tough enough question, and you’re going to be
confronted with a time when no one has the answer you’re after. Don’t give up.
Keep searching for ways to get the answer, even if it means getting it yourself
through non-traditional means. Do your own tests. Analyze your own data.

Ask about the numbers
The great thing about the environment beat? It’s awash in data. The bad part?
Lots of it is seriously flawed. You need to know not only what the data you have
is telling you, but what it isn’t telling you. Ask the person who is responsible for
the data what goes into it, and what doesn’t.

Listen for databases
Your sources deal with databases every day. Ask them what they have. Or just
listen to them when they talk. We found out about a database of letters from
Congress when the source said, “hold on while I look in the database.”

Don’t forget the humans
One vital resource we tapped on Vanishing Wetlands was recent retirees, people
who had spent a career in the agency we were covering who could be honest
about it. We asked people we talked to if they knew others who would talk. We
also kept our eyes out for impact on people’s lives.

Don’t be afraid of ambition
Don’t accept that you don’t have time, or the resources, or whatever. They’re
excuses. FOIA interesting records on your down time. Gather string slowly, piece
by piece, and store it for the future. Build a database library that can help you on
multiple stories. And go to the top with your questions.
