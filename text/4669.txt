Agenda
1. Intro
2. Explain Firefox's database management extension, SQLite Manager.
3. Demo how to use the SELECT statement and the FROM command to find and view specific data.
4. Demo how to filter data using the WHERE criteria command.
5. Demo how to sort data using the ORDER BY command.
6. Open floor for questions.
Hand off to Part 2 for GROUP BY, plus COUNT and SUM
.

SQL lets you "ask" questions of your data. Run queries to do "background research" in your
dataset so that you'll have evidence-based questions for your interviews. --Me, and everyone
else at IRE

.
Structured Query Language lets you turn regular questions into queries, i.e. questions that a database can
understand using English-like words and phrases.
If you pick up a SQL book, you'll quickly learn about the "CRUD" concept, which stands for Create, Retrieve,

A few dam stories
Hundreds of Texas dams at risk of failure
Lax enforcement of aging, unsafe dams puts Ohioans at risk
Where are evacuation plans for Ohio’s earthen dams?
Dam Shame: Hoover’s workforce nears retirement, gov’t scrambles to fill jobs
Hydroelectricity is getting less reliable due to global warming

What is a query?
We run real life queries all the time. Even before you learn SQL, I'm sure you can interpret this:
SELECT soups, salads
FROM menu
WHERE soups = noodle AND salads = caesar
We see query results all the time too. Here are typical screenshots from SportsCenter:

Weather or not we realize it, we think about the world and use logic in our questions that is very similar to these
structured queries, so hopefully this will feel somewhat natural.

COMPUTER?!?

4/15

Trekkies, remember when Captain Picard would ask questions of the Enterprise's computer? He was basically
running queries, yet in a super cool, voice activated way, from the Federation's version of Siri. Database
Management Systems, including SQLite Manager, also let you run queries, though in a not-quite-as-cool manually
typed way. But hey, it still works... any Trekkies?

SQL queries in plain speak pseudo code (fill in the blanks)
SELECT means, "Hey database program, give me stuff in ____ fields."
FROM means, "Hey database program, use ____ table."
WHERE means, "Hey database program, only give me stuff that meets ____ criteria."
ORDER BY means, "Hey database program, sort the stuff by the ____ field, then list it upward or downward."
GROUP BY means, "Hey database program, put certain stuff in this pile and other stuff in that pile."
Complex queries mean, "Hey database program, do a lot of crazy things at once, please."

Turn questions into queries
Imagine you're doing a story about dam safety and you get your hands on a dataset from the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers' Nat'l Inventory of Dams (probably because you went to IRE's Dams page). Of course your mind goes to
work on various questions that you'll want answered, from the serious to the curious...
1. If the dams break, who could be hurt, i.e. which dams are near homes, schools, etc.?
2. Among these high hazard dams, which ones have NOT been inspected in years?
3. Which dams are old (possibly neglected) and which ones are new (possibly untested)?
4. Who owns each dam? Who would be alerted if a particular dam began to fail?
5. What additional leads or angles could you derive from this data? (anyone? anyone?)
For example: Which of these dams doesn't have an EAP?
Jot down your additional questions because you should know enough SQL commands by the end of session 3 to
write sophisticated queries on your own.

SELECT
This is the workhorse command, pretty much every query you write will begin with SELECT because it means
SHOW ME stuff according to given parameters.
Use SELECT to initiate a query, followed by field names to retrieve data from particular columns (or by an asterisk *
to retrieve data in all the columns).
Use FROM to indicate which table to retrieve data from.

Ready? Here we go...
Open your Firefox web browser
In the top menu, go to Tools » SQLite Manager

If a prompt asks you to reconnect dams.sqlite, click OK.

Or connect the dams database from its location on your drive
Click on the dams table
Go to the Execute SQL tab
Type the query below and click the Run SQL button
SELECT *
FROM dams;
Now the task is to examine all the info that this dataset
contains. But since you're not a robot, begin figuring out
what's what by first referring to the dataset's definitions list. Such lists are usually provided. They might also be
called a records layout or something similar that indicates an official rundown of what each of the abbreviated fields

Jot down a few fields of which you'll want to see the contents, for instance, state and dam_name.
SELECT state, dam_name
FROM dams;

TIP: Refine your SQL queries
Use AS to display an alternate name or nickname for an abbreviated field in the query results.
Use LIMIT to control the number of results displayed.
SELECT state, dam_name AS "Dam"
FROM dams
LIMIT 10;
Try a quick query in which you nickname the Enfrc_Auth field as Enforcement Authority and the Fed_Con fields as
Federal Contractor.

FUN FACT: the SELECT command can do math
Try this:
SELECT 5 + 5

WHERE
Now that we know how to grab and view a bunch of data, let's narrow our results by indicating what certain kind of
data we want to see.

Q1. Which NPDP dams have the highest hazard potential?

HINT: Hazard means homes, people, population areas, etc. If you recall...
Field

Type

NPDP_Hazard

text

Description
Potential hazard to the downstream area resulting from dam failure or misoperation.
Taken from Stanford's "National Performance of Dams Program".

So, the NPDP_hazard field measures high hazard dams -- dams near people's homes, therefore, our query's
condition must meet high hazard dams.
SELECT state, dam_name, NPDP_hazard
FROM dams
WHERE NPDP_hazard = "HIGH";
You could be more exact and change this query to show the city instead of the state. Recall...
Field

Type

City_02 text

Description
The nearest city, taken from the 2002 data

TIP: Know your SQL version
There are different flavors of SQL with slightly different ingredients. For instance;
- SQLite's WHERE command uses a percentage sign % instead of the asterisk symbol * used in MS Access.
- In SQLite, you query dates as YYYY-MM-DD string values wrapped in quotes instead of using the number sign # in
MS Access.
Q2. For your story, you want to go visit the most forgotten, neglected dam. Can you determine ahead of
time which high hazard dams haven't been inspected in more than seven years?

TIP: Find this AND/OR that
10/15

You can use AND to specify a second condition. You can use OR to differentiate conditions.
SELECT state, dam_name, NPDP_hazard, insp_date
FROM dams
WHERE NPDP_hazard = "HIGH" AND insp_date < "2009-01-01";
Use LIKE to filter with widcards
ABC% finds a string that starts with 'ABC'.
%XYZ finds a string that ends with 'XYZ'.
%LMNOP% finds a string that contains 'LMNOP' within it.
Imagine you know that the dam you're interested in has the word "Memorial" in its name but you can't recall the rest
of the name. You could use a wildcard to query the dataset for that word to see what results you get:
SELECT state, dam_name, NPDP_hazard, insp_date
FROM dams
WHERE dam_name LIKE "%memorial%";
This query result is a great example of finding a tiny needle in this big ol' haystack because on one hand, only one
of these results, Craig Memorial, is a high hazard dam, while on the other hand, only one of them even has an
inspection date, Mills Memorial. So depending on your story angle, you've narrowed your findings down to one dam
out of 2,482.

ORDER BY
Use ORDER BY to filter results downward or upward (i.e. descending or ascending).
Q3. Which dams are potentially dangerous, forgotten, and also over 40 years old?
SELECT state, dam_name, NPDP_hazard, insp_date, year_comp
FROM dams
WHERE NPDP_hazard = "HIGH" AND insp_date < "2009-01-01" AND year_comp < 1975
ORDER BY insp_date;
Q4. Who owns each of these dams?
SELECT state, dam_name, NPDP_hazard, insp_date, year_comp, owner_name
FROM dams
WHERE NPDP_hazard ="HIGH" AND insp_date < "2009-01-01" AND year_comp < 1975
ORDER BY insp_date;

TIP: Down vs. Up
Direction can be relative, like what's downtown from you might be uptown from me, so to minimize confusion, SQL

11/15

describes direction with these specific examples:
Use DESC (descending) to display results Z to A, last to first, most to least, highest to lowest: 9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0.
Use ASC (ascending) to display results A to Z, first to last, least to most, lowest to highest: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.
ASC is the default sorting order and is optional to include
Q5. Which of these dams does NOT have an EAP?
Field

Type

Description

EAP

text

Does the dam have an Emergency Action Plan, a plan to reduce the potential for property damage
and loss of life in case of dam failure or large flood.

SELECT dam_name, NPDP_hazard, insp_date, year_comp, owner_name, EAP
FROM dams
WHERE NPDP_hazard = "HIGH" AND insp_date < "2009-01-01" AND year_comp < 1975 AND EAP
<> "Y"
ORDER BY insp_date DESC;

Your turn...
Try to sort by River and County to find dams along the same stretch of river.
Find which dams have no emergency action plan.
Include numeric fields in your query.
Remember, the basic syntax follows this format:
SELECT fieldnameA, fieldnameB...
FROM tablenameX
WHERE fieldnameA = datapoint1 AND/OR fieldnameB = datapoint2...
ORDER BY fieldnameA/fieldnameB ASC/DESC;
These are the data set's numeric fields:
Field

Type

Description

Year_Comp

number Year in which the original main structure was completed

NID_Height

number Accepted as general height of the dam (maximum of dam height, structural height and
hydraulic height)

NID_Storage

number Accepted as general storage of the dam

Dam_Length

number In feet, the length along the top of the dam

Max_Discharge number Number of cubic feet per second that the spillway is capable of discharging
Drain_Area

number In square miles, the area that drains to a particular point (in this case, the dam) on a
river or stream

12/15

Field

Type

Description

Insp_Freq

number In years, the scheduled frequency interval for periodic inspections.

Num_Struc

number Number of separate structures associated with this dam project

Answer Key
A1. There are 227 such dams.
A2. There are 41 such dams.
A3. There are 31 such dams.
A4. There are 31 such dams.
A5. There are 2 such dams.
Your turn answers:
SELECT dam_name, NPDP_hazard, insp_date, year_comp, owner_name, EAP, river
FROM dams
WHERE NPDP_hazard = "HIGH" AND insp_date < "2009-01-01" AND year_comp < 1975
ORDER BY river;
This brings up a good point: compare "Roanoke" to "Roanoke River"
Dams with no action plan
SELECT dam_name, NPDP_hazard, insp_date, year_comp, owner_name, EAP
FROM dams
WHERE NPDP_hazard = "HIGH" AND insp_date < "2009-01-01" AND year_comp < 1975 AND EAP
<> "Y"
ORDER BY insp_date DESC;
Example query on two numeric fields
SELECT dam_name, NPDP_hazard, insp_date, NID_height, volume, EAP
FROM dams
WHERE NPDP_hazard = "HIGH" AND insp_date < "2009-01-01" AND volume IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY insp_date DESC;
.

Quizzy question...
Are fruit market assortments more like ORDER BY or GROUP BY?
