THREAT MODELING helps you identify threats to the
things you value and who you need to protect them
from. When building a threat model, you can ask
yourself the following questions.
●
●
●
●
●

●
●
●
●

What do I want to protect?
Who do I want to protect it from?
What are the consequences if I fail?
How likely are these consequences?
How can I address the most likely risks?

THREAT MODELING GLOSSARY:

What assets are you protecting?

2

Asset: What I want to protect

Who are your adversaries?
●
●

Adversaries: Who I want to protect my assets from

$1 million worth of diamonds
Money in the safe
Alarm code
Anything else?

Threats: How bad the consequences are if I fail

Jewelry thieves
Anyone else? (Consider: Who might have
access to the jewelry store safe? What about
cleaning crews, or maintenance staff?)

Risk: The likelihood that a particular threat against a
particular asset will actually occur
Adversary capability: What it is able to do to achieve
its aims. For example, a country's security services
might have the capability to listen to telephone calls
while a neighbor may have the capability to watch
you from their window. To say that an adversary “has"
a capability does not mean that they will necessarily
use that capability. It does mean that you should
consider and prepare for the possibility.

What are the consequences if you fail?
●
●

Theft of jewelry
Any other threats? (What if the safe code or
alarm code is stolen?)

Try it! Make a threat model for a jewelry store owner:

THREAT MODEL FOR A
JEWELRY STORE OWNER
YOU inherit a JEWELRY STORE in the city.
The JEWELRY STORE has:
●
●
●
●
●
●
●

$1 million worth of diamonds.
A staff of five people.
An alarm system.
A safe.
A cash register.
A camera monitoring the door.
A pin-protected alarm for the door.

How can you address the most likely risks?
●
●

Changing the passcode every month, and after
an employee leaves.
What else?

Low likelihood

Risk

Low consequence

Enraged bear

How likely are these consequences? This depends on your adversaries’ capabilities.
