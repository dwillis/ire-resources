Searching for companies
●

If OpenCorporates doesn’t have a register you’re after yet, don’t strike it off –
branches registered in other jurisdictions may still provide useful leads.

●

Create an account to use advanced search, enabling searches using:
○

Current, alternative and previous names, company numbers, registered
addresses, and trademarks.

Filter by:
○

Jurisdiction of incorporation, data held, current status, company type,
branches and nonprofits, global industry codes.

●

Government gazettes have been reconciled to companies:
○

These are an untapped resource, often indicating changes to a company
months before the official register.

●

Working with OpenOwnership to add beneficial ownership data:
○

UK data revealed 3000 in beneficial owners registered in tax havens, 19
politically exposed persons, 17 from the US sanctions list, 267 disqualified

directors.
Search for officers
●

The most effective way to spider out networks and find leads.

●

Search by name – and cast your net wide to eliminate false negatives!
○

For example, Jurgen, Jurgan, Juren, Gurgen + Huren Mossack - so just
search Mossack!

○

Similarly named officers can be a useful way to find connections.

○

But there’s no identifier for people - so verify your sources!

○

Remember that companies can be officers too!

Reconciliation
●

Use the OpenRefine Endpoint to match vague company names in other datasets to
legal entities.

Corporate Groupings
●

User contributed collections of companies that humans (as opposed to corporate
lawyers) consider part of the same group – allowing legal entities to be linked to
fuzzy entities like wikipedia articles.

●

Donald Trump Corporate Grouping - community led effort to identify and group over
1,000 companies related to Trump, his family, and Trump Organisation.
