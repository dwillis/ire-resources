Oklahoma is oil-rich
and earthquake-prone
» Oil and gas production boomed
» Earthquakes surged

The science of oil and
gas-linked quakes
» First research came out in 2013
» Centered on 5.7M Prague quake
» Focused on disposal wells

» The scientific case kept growing...

… and growing. New paper released this week.

Quake data: Mag isn’t
everything
» Depth matters
» Faults matter
» Shaking matters

Today: Regulators are
responding
» Making sure wells aren’t too deep
» Shutting down wells
» Limiting well volumes

responding
» Making sure wells aren’t too deep
» Shutting down wells
» Limiting well volumes
» Limiting volumes over huge areas

Seems to be working!

Location, location, location.

It’s really about people though.

Where to find good quake data

Oklahoma Geological
Survey
» OK earthquake catalog
» CSV, KML, SHP files for each year
» Also pre-compiled datasets
(complete, M3, M4, time slices)
» Handy for SQL, PostgreSQL, etc.

U.S. Geological Survey
» U.S. earthquake catalog
» CSV, KML, JSON (harder to use)

» CSV, KML, JSON (harder to use)
» But USGS has intensity data

Where to find good oil industry data

Oklahoma Corporation
Commission
» occeweb.com
» datafiles = XLS of UIC wells, 1012
reports

» databases = operators, permits,
etc.

Well browsin’

Taco browsin’

Taco data elusive :(

Dry, abandoned taco #sad

EPA
» EPA regulates wells in Osage
County
» EPA has data ...

» EPA has data …
» … prolly have to FOIA to get it.

Earthquakes on a deadline

Quakes on a deadline
» Twitter feels it first
» Early quake data often changes
» Slow down, be careful
» Wait for data, DYFI info
» Get your own data

#okquake has made me a better reporter

Data reporter MAP, DB

Learn how to read science, talk to scientists

It’s really about people though.
