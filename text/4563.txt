GOT MILK?
GOT MANURE!

THE PROBLEM
• Concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs)
produce 335 million tons of dry manure per year
• That’s 3 times the amount generated by humans
• Cow manure has more contaminants than human waste
• The average dairy cow produces 120 pounds of manure
per day
• One dairy CAFO of 10,000 animals produces as much
waste as a city of 250,000 people.

WHAT’S UPSTREAM?

FOUL CONDITIONS

MANURE LAGOONS
• Manure is stored in unlined lagoons, all of which
leak into groundwater
• There are 415 lagoons adjacent to rivers and
streams that feed Puget Sound
• There are tens of thousands of these lagoons
across the U.S.

MANURE LAGOONS

MAP OF MANURE
LAGOONS

ALL LAGOONS LEAK
• All earthen CAFO waste lagoons are designed to leak
• Darcy’s Law: Physics principle describes liquid flow
through a porous medium, confirming 100% leak rate
• Numerous studies on CAFO lagoons illustrate this
universal phenomenon
• “NRCS guidance considers an acceptable initial seepage
rate [from manure lagoons] to be 5,000 gallons per acre
per day.” NRCS Agricultural Waste Management Field Handbook, Chapter 10:
Agricultural Waste Management System Component Design

OVER-APPLICATION OF
MANURE TO FIELDS
 In fact, as Dr. Shaw extensivel y describes in his expert report,
Cow Palace consistently made such non - agronomic manure
applications. See, e.g., ECF No. 237 -2 at ¶¶ 76-78 (February 27,
2007 soil sample for Field 1 showed 480 lbs./ac nitrogen
available; alfalfa crop had capacity to use 480 lbs./ac per initial
DNMP estimate, yet manure applied on May 15 -26, June 19, June
27, and November 5); ¶¶ 83 -84 (September 5, 2008 soil sample
for Field 1 showed 269 lbs./ac nitrogen available; triticale crop
had capacity to use 250 lbs./ac per initial DNMP estimate, yet
manure applied September 17 -26); ¶ 101 (similar); ¶ 107 (applied
612,000 gallons after soil test showed no more fertilizer needed);
¶ 109 (2.562 million gallons applied after soil test showed no
more fertilizer needed); ¶ 133 (similar); ¶ 138 (2.160 million
gallons); ¶ 144 (2.4 million gallons); ¶ 147 (1.236 million
gallons); ¶ 149 (3.0465 million gallons); ¶ 155(k) (5.994 million
gallons); ¶ 155(m) (3.6 million gallons); ¶ 156(e) (2.016 million
gallons); 156(f) (4.224 million gallons); ¶ 156(k) (780,000
gallons); ¶ 157(b) (1.260 million gallons); ¶ 157(h) (3.258 million
gallons). Based on just these examples (there are countless
more), the Dairy applied an astounding 33,148,500 gallons of
manure after receiving soil samples that showed no need for
additional fertilization

OVER-APPLICATION OF
MANURE TO FIELDS

RESULT:
MASSIVE WATER POLLUTION
Nitrates: Acute contaminants linked to
spontaneous abortions,
methemoglobinemia (blue baby
syndrome), birth defects, and cancer
Fecal coliform: 36,000 acres of shellfish
beds are closed.
Pathogens (E. coli, cryptosporidium,
salmonella, giardia, camphylobacter)
Fish kills (North Carolina)

REGULATORY FAILURE
Lack of political will: science v. politics
Legislative punishment for agency
enforcement
1% of CAFOs in Washington are covered by
a permit, even though coverage is required
under state and federal law.
WSDA: “Thank you for your attention to
Nutrients!”
Dairy industry is one of the most powerful
lobbies in the country.

REGULATORS:
IN BED WITH INDUSTRY
Text messages between the Washington State
Department of Agriculture & dairy industry:
 “Just a Happy Thanksgiving to you and yours. And
have a terrific trip to Cabo.”
 “Thirsty this evening?”
 “I need a warm beach badly.”
 “I will be either standing in line at Disney World or
drinking a beer and talking to you.”
 “A call went out to a dozen farms late last night to
circle the shit wagons and get out to Snook’s and
take a load of crap.”

A DECADES-OLD
PROBLEM
 Lower Yakima Valley: Over 20% of drinking water
wells contaminated with Nitrates.
 Whatcom County: In September 2014, the Lummi
Nation was forced to close 335 acres of Portage
Bay shellfish beds due to high levels of fecal
coliform contamination. In December 2014, the
Lummi Nation had to close an additional 161 acres
 Sumas Blaine Aquifer: Most contaminated aquifer
in Washington
 A nationwide problem.

GROUNDBREAKING
LEGAL DECISION
CARE et al. v. Cow Palace, LLC; Henry Bosma Dairy &
Liberty Dairy, LLC; D & A Dairy et al.; George & Margaret,
LLC, et al.
 Manure is solid waste.
 Over-application: “untethered” to the waste management plan.
Millions of excess gallons of manure applied
 All lagoons are designed to leak

 Impacts to human health
 Dead baby not required: “alarmingly… “
 Equals impact to environment

 Consent decree filed May 11, 2015: potential to change the
industry
