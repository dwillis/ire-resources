What Facebook Knows
About You

The extension was installed 40,000+ times
It currently has 34,000+ weekly users
50,000+ unique ad categories were shared with us

As part of the extension, we created a way for the user to tell us what they thought of the ad categories
Facebook assigned to them. They had three options: “Creepy” “Spot on” and “Wrong.” We collected
these rankings and below you have the top five for each category. The screenshot on the right is the
top five in each of these categories.

We downloaded a list of 29,000 categories that the site provides to ad buyers.
Nearly 600 of the categories were described as being provided by third-party
data brokers. (Most categories were described as being generated by clicking
pages or ads on Facebook.)
The categories from commercial data brokers were largely financial, such as
“total liquid investible assets $1-$24,999,” “People in households that have an
estimated household income of between $100K and $125K,” or even
“Individuals that are frequent transactor at lower cost department or dollar
stores.”
None of those categories were among the tens of the thousands of “interests”
that Facebook showed users.

Self-identified their political beliefs in
their profile

-

Tracked links shared with friends over

Facebook Political Ad Tracker

~*~ mIcRoTaRgEtInG ~*~
-

Politicians and campaign folks love it because you can precisely show one
message to one demographic and another message to another demographic.
-

-

Some people care about social security
And others care about schools
(as a simplified example)

But this is hard for journalists...

When I go to
Facebook, I see...

Why?

One reason you're seeing this ad is that AARP Advocates wants to reach people
with the employer The New York Times listed on their Facebook profiles.There
may be other reasons you're seeing this ad, including that AARP Advocates wants
to reach people ages 18 and older who live or were recently in the United States.
This is information based on your Facebook profile and where you've connected to
the internet.

(emphasis added)

It's a problem
How do we see what non-journalists are seeing?

Browser Extension!

Hundreds of readers submitted their ads to us.

17,849 ads

Fancy Image Matching Algorithm
That mostly works...

But sometimes doesn't. (Which one of these is not like the others?)

Why Am I Seeing This?

Location… (How'd Michigan vote again?)

Age!

Ethnicity!

Story!

Getting data out of Facebook
API?
Other means?
-

-

Browser extensions
-

Odd to write

-

Hard to get people to install

-

Desktop only

-

Facebook's CSS is "non-deterministic" which makes jQuery selectors hard

-

But it works!

Other methods?????????
