What does it do?
Samples the radio frequency range of 22-2200 MHz
Tune into frequencies in software
Visualize wide swath of spectrum
Includes:
- AM, FM, TV, Police, Fire, Emergency, Coast Guard,
Security, National Weather Service...and many more

WebSDR
Dedicated servers with large
antennas that are receiving
local radio broadcasts,
allowing multiple remote users
worldwide the ability to tune to
different frequencies.
WebSDR servers (requires
Java applet to run)

iOS friendly experimental WebSDR client:

ADS-B Aircraft data
Automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast

Dump1090: https://github.com/antirez/dump1090
Either clone from github or download as a zip, then follow the installation instructions. Type:
./dump1090 --interactive --net --aggressive
Data should start filling the screen. Each line corresponds to an aircraft somewhere over your head!
Neat, right?
OK, now go to: http://localhost:8080/
Boom. Instant map of every airplane you’re tracking. If you don’t see anything yet, give it a minute
(assuming there are airplanes around you and your antenna gets a good signal).
Good tutorial: http://www.radiohobbyist.org/blog/?p=1248

dump1090 looks
like this when in
net mode
