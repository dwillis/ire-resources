“ESPN's "Outside the Lines" reviewed
health department inspection reports for
food and beverage outlets at all 107
North American arenas and stadiums
that were home to Major League
Baseball, National Football League,
National Hockey League and National
Basketball Association teams in 2009. At
30 of the venues (28 percent), more than
half of the concession stands or
restaurants had been cited for at least
one "critical" or "major" health violation.
Such violations pose a risk for foodborne
illnesses that can make someone sick, or,
in extreme cases, become fatal.”
