When Reporters Become Targets

The threats are changing
• Transnational & cross border actors
• Digital attacks
• Social media threat, trolling and harassment
• “Fake news” prosecutions & claims
• Direct instigation of violence (Duterte, Trump)

What’s the cost
• Psychological
• Threats to sources
• Fragmentation & mistrust
• Discrediting of legitimate reporting
• Financial cost of defense
• Combines with economic climate to increase stress on
publications and journalists

How to push back?
• Take threats seriously.
• Share threats and harassment with editors and colleagues.
• Police your social media and digital vulnerabilities.
• Limit exposure to toxic comments/trolling
• Maintain your ethical compass.
• On high-risk stories, consider cross-publication reporting,
editing and publishing.
• Threats and attacks against colleagues are news stories.
INVESTIGATE THEM.

A global challenge to journalism

1. Mass tragedies matter. They aren’t
just any story.

2. Be Skeptical of early “facts.” Go
slow. Correct the record.

3. Every mass shooter is different.
Make no assumptions.

4. Keep Act II on Page I. Aftermath is
news.

5. Remember the local reporters.

6. Investigate and narrate

7. Handle images with care.

8. Ethics matter.

9. Practice self care. Be a good
colleague.

10. Have a strategy for online hatred
and craziness.
