difficult it will be to document, a project is born.

There were no official stats on oil spills — the
Feds regulate pipelines, everything else is left to
the states.

North Dakota has lots of public info on oil
production, but it’s mostly in PDFs

Spills were recently posted online, but the format
isn’t very analyze-able– it’s not searchable, you
have to read incidents one at a time.

Over the summer,
speaking to farmers in the
town of Antler, Lynn D.
Helms, the director of the
Department of Mineral
Resources, announced “a
little bit of good news”:
The spill rate per well was
“steady or down.”

Creating Our Own Database
1) Downloading the incident records required a scraper. In this
case we used a browser emulator to go through the site and
download the pages

2) Cleaning up the mess — standardizing company names,
incident types, correcting errors — initial report said zero
spilled, but full text of incident said something else.

We built a list of report URLS in Excel for WGET:

Putting It All
Together
I created an internal
Web site that served
not just as a way to
share latest data and
findings with
colleagues, but a way
to help us split
administrative tasks,
and to conceptualize
our analytical points.

ENFORCEMENT
“…reported that the Department of Mineral
Resources could not provide details regarding rule
violations that led to 45 enforcement actions against
oil companies. The fact is … was invited to visit the
Department of Mineral Resources where he could
review each case file for the information he sought,
but he chose not to. “
-- complaint from ND officials about a previous story about ND
enforcement

ENFORCEMENT

“The Times found that the Industrial Commission
wields its power to penalize the industry only as a last
resort. It rarely pursues formal complaints and
typically settles those for about 10 percent of the
assessed penalties. “ -- what we found after pulling
all the paper and typing it into a database
