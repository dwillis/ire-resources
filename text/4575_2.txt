Overview of
pipelines in the
U.S.
Who oversees them?
• Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety
Administration
• State utility agencies (Check Pipeline Safety Trust
for breakdown of state agency oversight)

Source: PHMSA

Types of pipelines:
– Transmission lines
– Gathering lines

– Distribution lines

Why do
pipelines
break?
They’re
pretty old.

Accidents

Story Ideas

– What do the pipelines in your community carry?
Are these substances classified as hazardous?
– What types of pipelines run through your
state/community

Before an
accident

– Are they regulated? If they are, are they all
treated equally by PHMSA and state regulations?

– How often are they inspected? Who is doing the
inspection? Are companies required to provide
inspection data to federal/state agencies?
– Are local emergency teams prepared to deal with
spills or explosions? Have they been trained to
deal with hazardous materials?

Story Ideas

– How old was the pipeline? How often was it
inspected and maintained?

– What was the operating pressure and
temperature and did the company adhere to
PHMSA regulations?

After a spill
or explosion

– Did the explosion/spill occur in a highconsequence or low-consequence area?
– What are the health impacts on the people
nearby? How well are the health effects
understood?
– Backgrounder on the operator: Does the
company have a history of violations? A
record of accidents?

Where to
find data?
PHMSA

– Hazardous Materials: Look up individual
incident reports for hazardous materials

– Hazmat incident statistics (overview):
Contains yearly and ten year summaries of
incidents, including useful breakdowns by
state, type of commodity being transported
etc.
– Natural gas, liquid and LNG incident:
Download accident data from 1970s and
1980s to present for natural gas, liquefied
natural gas and hazardous liquids.
– Enforcement Action : Search for PHMSA’s
enforcement data by year, operator, state

Where to
find data?

• EIA: Download natural gas pipeline capacities
and planned projects
• OSHA: Search for employee fatalities and
injuries

OSHA
EPA
EIA

• EPA’s Toxics Release Inventory: Useful when
backgrounding an operator. Use it to look up
accidents at facilities operated by the same
company

Sources

• PHMSA and your state pipeline regulatory agency
(often the same as the local utility agency)
• Pipeline Safety Trust: A non-profit watchdog
promoting pipeline safety
• Pipeline Safety Coalition: An advocacy group trying to
build awareness about pipeline safety
• National Association of Pipeline Safety
Representatives: Non-profit organization of state
pipeline safety regulatory personnel
• Industry associations
– Interstate Natural Gas Association of America
– American Petroleum Institute
– Association of Oil Pipe Lines
