Search for perfect examples
● Look everywhere for sources
o Lawsuits, Facebook groups, advocacy orgs, etc.
● Always make that last call, even on the last day
● Be transparent about your story
● Explain why it’s important that they talk
● Fully vet a source as quickly as you can

Squeeze out the details
● Ask for medical records, test
results, journals, photos
● Call back and ask again what
happened in a different way
● Show up
● What did they feel, think, smell,
taste?
● Ask for tiny details
● Double-check every fact in your
story. Don’t assume you got it
right the first time

They’re refusing to talk? Be persistent
● Government sources often assume you will just go away. DO
NOT. Be polite yet persistent.
● Keep a record of your communication with everyone and
refer back to it in conversations
● Go above their heads: Call, email bosses of those ignoring
you.
● Explain that you are trying to understand the problem. Be
fair.
● Find a different source with the same info
● Plan to write about their obfuscating; take careful notes and
write appropriate emails

Tell a story.
