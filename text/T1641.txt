Public Use Microdata Sample

It is called PUMS and since 1960 it has been the crown jewel of each decennial census.
After protracted discussions that began in May 2000, and finally ended last December,
the census user community led by the academics have essentially prevailed over initial
Census Bureau proposals to cripple the 2000 PUMS release in the name of privacy.
Why was the Census Bureau so worried about privacy? Because PUMS is the next best
thing to raw census data itself. It is the answers to each of the long form questions for
each member of a housing unit. (Although some answers will be somewhat obfuscated to
protect individual privacy.)
PUMS is the data that allows you to make all the cross-tabulations that the Census
Bureau does not provide in its various summary files.
But there is a BIG limitation and that is geography. There are no counties, places, tracts
or census blocks in PUMS data. Instead there are PUMAs -- Public Use Microdata Areas
-- which have a minimum population of 100,000 persons. And new for Census 2000 will
be the Super PUMA, with a minimum population of 400,000 persons.
PUMA boundaries can be frustrating to conceptualize and difficult to describe to readers.
Places and Counties of 100,000 population or greater usually can be identified by either a
single PUMA or combination of PUMAs. But in rural areas, you'll find that counties are
combined to create a single PUMA. The boundaries for 2000 PUMAs and Super PUMAs
are still being determined, in cooperation with local officials in each state. Look for
Census Bureau boundary files when that work is complete.
PUMS data is huge and cannot be effectively utilized with Excel or Access software. It
is much easier with SPSS or SAS.

PUMS data will come in two flavors, a 1% sample of all households and a 5% sample of
all households. Because the sample includes everyone in a household (or group quarter),
these translate into approximately 1% and 5% samples of the entire population.
That means that nationwide, there will be about 2.85 million records in the 1% sample
and about 14.25 million records in the 5% sample.
The record sizes for your area will depend on your state population. For instance, the 5%
sample for California in 1990 contains 1,456,011 records.
Because this is sample data, every record has a weight associated with it, and the weights
vary widely. There is one weight for the household and another weight for each person
in the household. In 1990 the weights were whole numbers. The need to weight each
record as cross-tabs are being created is one reason you need powerful statistical software
that can easily accomplish the task.
Both sets of PUMS data will contain two tables, one for the household and the other for
the persons, linked hierarchically by a serial number field. (The easiest way to deal with
that is to copy the household record onto the person record of each person in the
household, which wastes disk storage space with repetive data, but simplifies
computations. My 1990 combined table contained only 124 fields but I left out some
fields that I thought I would never use.).
The simple way to think about the differences between the two forthcoming versions of
PUMS is that the 1% sample will NOT have any limitations on the data contained, but
the smallest geography will be a Super PUMA of at least 400,000 persons. The 5%
sample will have generalized answers for race, ancestry, occupation, birthplace, language
spoken and probably some others for any category for which there are fewer than 10,000
responses nationwide. But the geography will go down the the 100,000-person PUMA
level.
According to Steve Ruggles, Distinguished McKnight Professor at the University of
Minnesota, head of UM's Population Center, and director of the association of academics
that lobbied the Census Bureau hard for more data (and mostly won), that could mean the
loss of about one-sixth of the occupation titles available in 1990, the loss of upwards of
one-quarter of the birthplaces listed in 1990 PUMs, the loss of up to one-third of the
languages and the loss of perhaps a fifth of the ancestries available in 1990.
Detailed income data itemized by various income categories (wage and salary, social
security, public assistance, etc) will be available, but will be top-coded, just as in the
Summary File 3 data. That means that above a certain level, the mean statewide income
of all persons exceeding that level will be substituted for actual income.
Paul Mackun of the Census Bureau, who wrote the December 20, 2001 paper titled The
U.S. Census Bureau's Plans for the Census 2000 Public Use Microdata Sample Files
(http://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/pums.html), said that current

projections are for the 1% sample to be released at the end of this year and the 5% sample
to be released by the end of 2003. He said specific content coding decisions have not yet
been made. Mackun also said that technical documentation for PUMS data will not be
released until the data itself.
Sampling Error: The ugly side of PUMS is that it is a sample and thus subject to
sampling error. In 1990, the Census Bureau devoted an entire 17-page chapter in the tech
doc to explaining how to calculate the sampling error. Tables were provided for
determining error margins, as well as formulas for making more exacting calculations.
Naturally, the bigger the sample size, the lower the error margin.
As a rule of thumb, Ruggles said social scientists seldom try to publish anything where
the sample size is less than 1,000. "But I much prefer it when I have 50,000 or 60,000
persons in my sample," he added.
That means that looking at subsets of data within a single PUMA can get dangerous. But
even a sample size of only 200 or 300 persons can translate into a weighted sample of
10,000 to 15,000 persons and sampling errors in the 3% to 4% range, which can be
tolerable. (See examples of size and error margin effects below).
The reality is that your focus should be regional findings rather than local. And for
smaller circulation newspapers that's going to mean the MSA/PMSA instead of the
hometown.
You can do some great stories with the big picture, however.
In early 1993, shortly after release of the 1990 PUMS data we were able to publish two
page one stories on racial and gender inquities in worker pay. We documented how
Whites were better paid than minorities at every comparable education level. We also
detailed how men were better paid than women in virtually every line of work including
waitpersons, secretaries and hairdressers.
(See clip images at end of paper.)

DATA EXAMPLES: California Journalists in 1990
To illustrate some of the virtues and vices of PUMS data, I took a look at various
characteristics of Californian's who identified themselves in the 1990 Census as
journalists -- the Census occupation category of editors and reporters:
