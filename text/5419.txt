The College Scorecard: Why we
have it and why you should care

What is the Scorecard?
• Most accessible consumer tool for students and
families who want to see college outcomes
• Includes data on 7,000 colleges
• Largest ever release of higher ed data
• Transparency measure provides some level of
accountability for colleges
• Treats students as consumers and customers

How we got the Scorecard
• The Obama administration introduced the tool in
2015
• It resulted from a push for a college ranking system
from the administration that got serious backlash
• College officials still have problems with it
• Limitations remain but the Scorecard was a big step
for revealing outcomes at individual institutions

What does the Scorecard show?
• Earnings for graduates at particular colleges (also
includes threshold earnings, measuring whether a
graduate makes more than a typical high school
graduate) just those who received federal aid??
• Median debt held by graduates
• Repayment rates on graduates’ student loan debt

New features
• The College Scorecard update last fall included a
comparison tool that allows you to select and view
up to 10 schools at once

How should you use the tool?
• Differentiate by predominant degree type when
comparing schools
• Once you’ve done that, you can compare across
states or regionally
• Comparing schools within a state is useful because
you’re looking at colleges operating in the same
policy environment

What kinds of questions can you ask with the
Scorecard?
• Can use the results to make basic rankings of
colleges in your state (four-years publics whose
graduates make the highest salaries or make the
most progress paying down their debt)
• The results you see when comparing schools should
also point you toward additional questions (why do
grads of some schools struggle to repay loans more
than those who attended similar programs?)
• The outcomes won’t give you answers but should
get to scrutinize the available data further

• Go beyond simple
comparisons to use
advance search
features on the tool
• Look for schools with
particular outcomes
• “What schools costing
less than $10,000
have a better than 50
percent graduation
rate?”

What questions should the data make you ask
the colleges you cover?
• Are they aware of their graduates’ struggles
repaying loan debt compared to similar schools?
• What are they doing to get more students to
graduate?
• Do they have information on whether graduates
with certain majors struggle to repay loans?
• How are they serving Pell recipients (typically lowincome) versus non-Pell students?

Limitations of the Scorecard data
• Data on community colleges and less than four-year
institutions is incomplete
• Doesn’t tell you outcomes for students who didn’t
receive aid
• Only institutional-level data

How is the Scorecard being used now?
• College Access groups have built their own data
tools using the Scorecard API
• 2.5 million unique visitors to the site
• Some evidence indicates that Scorecard has mostly
been used by students who are best positioned to
navigate the college process
