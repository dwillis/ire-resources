Do I have to learn?
Google Refine
• Very powerful for cleaning
dirty data
• Handy export formats
• But a steep learning curve for
non-coders
• Not built for collaborative
work
• And kind of buggy at times

Geocoding
How did we do? Google Fusion Tables

Do I have to learn?
Google Fusion Tables
• Yes

What have I got? TimeFlow

What have I got? TimeFlow

What have I got?
Tableau Public

Tablea
u Public
The kind of
maps where you
can click to filter
nearby charts or
tables:
very easy.

Tableau Public
Good for
Finding stories
Checking out your data to see what you have
Publishing and sharing shiny visualizations
PROS
• Control over design
• Control over how variables are used and displayed
• Ability to calculate new variables
• Rapidly expanding capabilities
• Awesome customer service when you run into trouble
• Easy to share, embed, resize
• No programming required
CONS
• Windows only (we run on virtual machine in a Mac, which cost us $42)
• 10,000-row limit
• Loads slowly
• Steep learning curve? Depends
• Based on snapshot of data — hard to make it update dynamically
