10 places to start an investigation:
1) Athletes & Crime
a. What percentage of athletes on your local college or pro team has been involved in crimes?
What type? Did they result in charges? Did they end in convictions? How does that compare to
what happens to a similar subset of male suspects? Are there patterns in the narratives?
b. How are coaches, teams, schools responding to criminal behavior?
c. What are teams/schools doing to be proactive about preventing crime among athletes?
d. Are athletes victims of crimes? (Fraud, theft, extortion, etc.) Theft of athletes is underreported.
e. Weapons violations?
f. Local, state & national criminal case searches are first step in researching a case, but:
i. Athletes often go by initials, middle names or nicknames on rosters. Make sure you have
the athlete’s full legal name before doing a search.
ii. Athletes are more likely than non-athletes to have legal counsel even for minor crimes.
iii. Athletes/coaches may have more incentive to get crimes sealed/expunged. So make
sure you include a search of local media for reports of crimes whose case files might
now be expunged. Bail bondsmen & jail incarceration records are also good sources.
iv. Make sure you check courts AND ALSO local law enforcement for cases that did not
result in charges - especially important in sexual assault/domestic violence incidents.
g. Set up social media monitors for all athlete, fan blog & campus newspapers. Often crime news
breaks there first. Grab social media chatter regarding a crime ASAP b/c it often gets deleted.
h. Develop relationships with the attorneys who most often represent athletes. Every team –
college & pro – has a liaison to the police dept. For local reporters, building a relationship w/that
person or another assistant/staffer is key on staying on top of reported crimes.
i. Some good efforts at logging athlete crimes:
i. San Diego Union-Tribune NFL athlete arrest database
ii. Arrest Nation: the sports arrest database
j. Note: Making comparisons across jurisdictions is tricky because public records, expungement,
local law enforcement/prosecutor bias, & community standards can influence how many crime
reports you can get your hands on. Comparing within a state is a much better barometer.

2) Campus cops
a. Crimes referred to student judicial affairs instead of local prosecutors?
b. Denied by FERPA? Doesn’t apply to criminal records.
Good reference – NACAU (or archived version here)
c. Private college PDs subject to public records laws in TX, VA, OH, GA, & NC; are yours secret?

3) Campus Sexual Assault & Title IX
a. Understanding Title IX & enforcement (from USDOE public affairs’ Jim Bradshaw):
i. OCR’s April 2014 sexual violence guidance.

b.
c.

d.
e.

ii. OCR’s April 2011 Dear Colleague Letter addressing sexual violence on campus.
iii. Guidance on Title IX coordinators.
iv. Title IX “Reading Room.”
v. Frequently asked questions about sex discrimination.
vi. NotAlone.gov with help for students and schools.
vii. For information on how OCR handles civil rights complaints, go here.
Track complaints via Joshua Eaton’s site or Chronicle of Higher Education (which has email
updates).
FERPA can restrict your access to the name of other students (incl. victims/witnesses, without
written consent of those students). But if alleged perpetrator in a disciplinary proceeding
related to a crime of violence or non-forcible sex offense is found to have violated school’s rules
or policies, you can get his/her name, violation committed, & any sanctions.
Title IX lawsuits are typically filed in federal court (www.pacer.gov). The “Nature of Suit” code is
often 440 or 448. Also look for lawsuits from expelled or disciplined students for unjust removal.
Examples: ESPN Outside the Lines on sexual assault at Baylor and the University of Missouri.

4) Fan Rights & Safety
a. Food and beverage
i. Look through health department inspection reports for stadium vendors & athlete food
caterers for critical violations, what kind of violations, repeat offenders, and what’s
being done. Get copies of official – and social media - complaints from fans about food.
ii. Check alcohol citations & DUIs. Get copies of vendor serving rules. Are they enforced
both in and out of the stadium? If not, has that created problems?
iii. Examples: Outside the Lines takes deep (and icky) dive into contaminated food at sports
venues in 2010 and exposes questionable food safety during the World Series in 2015.
b. Americans with Disabilities Act
i. Get ADA complaints from local and federal authorities. (Complaints can be filed here:
https://www.ada.gov/filing_complaint.htm) The U.S. Dept. of Justice enforces ADA.
ii. Check for ADA lawsuits against sports venues.
iii. Check with local disability rights groups, including veterans’ associations.
c. Fan injuries
i. Check baseball stadiums (or other sports with flying debris, incl. NASCAR). Also, fanover-railing problems. Check for police reports/lawsuits.
ii. Fan-on-fan violence. Beyond the police reports, request text messages sent to stadium
security during games, now that many venues have text message reporting systems.
5) Academic Fraud – Happening More & Penalized Less
a. If coaches or athletic department workers are not involved, it’s almost never an NCAA violation
b. Get aggregate data comparing standardized test scores of football/basketball players to rest of
student population (Example: Mike Knobler’s excellent AJC investigation)
c. Get breakdown of online vs. traditional classes for big money sports & how it’s changed
d. Get aggregate academic misconduct violations among regular students vs. athletes; request
information on type of cheating activity & penalties students faced.
Examples: Reuters Chinese student cheating investigation and WSJ int’l student cheating survey
e. Get correspondence between athletic academic advisers & athletics compliance officials (start
w/football & men’s basketball advisers & counselors), and/or correspondence between coaches
& academic advisers or faculty members (former Rutgers coach Kyle Flood: “I am sending it from
my personal email to ensure there will be no public vetting of the correspondence”)

f.

Examine the path football players take from high school to college, particularly NCAA “nonqualifiers” and junior-college transfers who don’t stick around long
g. Write about the increasing use of the “academic gap year,” when marginal students can make
miraculous academic recoveries & how players use it to gain NCAA eligibility
h. Investigate prep schools’ shady academic credentials & ties between college coaches and ACT
testing sites
i. Talk to academic advisers at community colleges that serve as big feeders to big athletic depts
j. Track down former academic advisers for major-college athletic departments, particularly ones
who have left the profession
k. Search the UNC data trove, including appendices (thanks WRAL.com & your #UNCdocs work)
l. Study the Southern Miss case file
m. Search “academic misconduct” in NCAA infractions database & why it’s increasing (metadata)

6) Athletics Finance 101
a. NCAA budget database: Education Department’s EADA (Equity in Athletic Disclosure Act)
b. Better: FOIA revenue-and-expense statements each university submits to NCAA each January
Story tips/ideas
c. Where are a school’s big spending increases?
d. Big salaries? WaPo examples: coaches’ buyouts and administrator pay.
e. Use Moody’s Investors data to explore increasing debt obligations
f. Check budget - How many people does it take to recruit a player? Have costs grown?
g. Student fees & institutional subsidies; HuffPost/Chronicle: “The $10 Billion Sports Tab”
h. Knight Commission’s Athletic & Academic Spending Database: athletics vs. academics spending
i. Power Five schools force Mid-Majors to spend more – data in USA Today’s 10+year database
j. Have schools’ costs of attendance (via their own websites) changed as NCAA allows more
spending on student-athletes? If schools’ total reported cost of attendance goes up, they have
to budget more financial aid for all students, not just top sports recruits. Examples: Chronicle on
fluctuations in aid allowances and CBSSports on analysis of FBS cost-of-attendance budgets.
k. How much are student fees propping up big football budgets? Talk to student government
leaders (past & present) and former university administrators. Get meeting minutes & athletic
requests from student fee committees. What’s the university’s goal for reducing its reliance on
fees? Examples: Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel and WTSP’s most recent story on USF.
l. Keep tabs on program cuts across all NCAA levels via email: UltimateSportsInsider.com

7) The Never-Ending Chase for Stadium Subsidies
a. The subsidy blueprint: How it usually goes down; Peter Gammons on MLB “blackmailing” cities
b. READ contracts carefully for fine print! Example: Tampa Bay Buccaneers only get richer
i. FOIA: drafts of contracts
ii. Public venue; but does team keep naming rights, ad revenues, ticket taxes, etc?
iii. Discounted rent? Parking concessions?
iv. Fatal “state-of-the-art clause?” Ex: VICE Sports & recent $187M D-Backs demands
v. Property tax breaks? Sales tax breaks? PILOTS?
vi. Revenue from non-sporting events?
vii. Maintenance costs on new facilities? Maintenance responsibility on old facilities?
c. What other money will team capture from local economy?
i. Not just sports businesses; real estate businesses now – what effects on other local biz?
ii. FOIA: LLC records, property records
iii. FOIA: emails to elected officials, gov’t real estate departments

iv. FOIA: bond capacity studies, site consultant reports & studies
d. Ticket prices WILL soar
i. Example: “Teams want your money so they can rip out seats & charge you more”
ii. Are you lucky enough to gain window into financials or biz plans via subsidy application?

8) Economic Impact Fallacies
a. Never believe the report!
b. FOIA: the actual study
i. Who paid for it?
ii. Did the study neglect opportunity cost or the substitution/cannibalization effect?
iii. Where is economic impact really going? Local? Or large chains in other cities?
c. Contact author, local academics/economists
d. REMEMBER: pro sports are retail businesses
e. How real are those “heads in beds?”
f. Examples: Rays Spring Training; Yankees Spring Training; Vocative on Spring Training

9) Politicians Love Stadiums!
a.
b.
c.
d.

FOIA: Emails & texts (don’t forget personal accounts/devices)
FOIA: comp tickets & suite attendees at public/university facilities
FOIA: gift disclosures
The “new stadium will bring new events to town all year long” claim
i. FOIA: Does your city have demonstrated need for new sports or entertainment venues?
ii. FOIA: How full are other major (publicly-run) sports, concert, & event venues?
iii. SOURCE: Competing venues – is there a need, or will new facility cannibalize biz?
iv. Resource: What kind of cities are stadium subsidies right for?
e. For every winner, there is a loser - what are your community’s other needs?
i. Example: Tampa Bay, Atlanta, Cincinnati, Glendale, Hartford
ii. SOURCE: Don’t forget the human element of whom the decisions will impact
f. Advice for politicians considering stadiums
