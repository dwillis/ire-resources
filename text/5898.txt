you can use sick leave

interview

Holding Them Accountable

• Transparency with viewers –
tell them the process
• Holding them accountable
means pinning them down –
word choice is key! Listen
for “on camera interview”
• Not my best interview – but I
was happy with the end

Case Study

• When you ask a good
question – when you are
precise in holding them
accountable – you can use it
later

• In his final days in office,
pays someone to install new
shelves/cabinets

impossible

• Tell them you’re recording
• We record our phoners on
camera

• Big companies rarely talk

• Holding them accountable
can be difficult
• Don’t be their PR machine

Holding Them Accountable

• Ask questions
• Hold them accountable in
their answers
• Pick their answers apart
• If they don’t answer – hold
them accountable by
pointing that out
• Pre-IRE=read statement

Case Study

• Government sometimes
won’t talk

• No interview=no dialogue?
• Ask questions to help gather
information

Holding Them Accountable

• Without clarifications, we
wouldn’t have been able to
point out the easiness of
getting approved for the
program.
