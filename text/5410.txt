What we’re not talking about:
❏ Hashtags
❏ Scroll depth
❏ Time on site
❏ Audience growth
❏ Facebook had a change of heart, now what?
What we think about:
❏ Who​ is this for? Who is most ​impacted​ by your story?
❏ Is this potential community ​ignored​?
❏ Where are the ​gaps​? Are you looking for sources, information, data, and can the
community help?
❏ How might we ​reach​ them? Who might ​help​ us?
❏ What ​kinds of info​rmation are they looking for? Where are they looking? What ​tools​ do
they already use?
❏ How might we keep them engaged and ​report back​?
Tools & Ways:
❏ Structured callout
Share your experience = Help us investigate via a form/questionnaire/survey
❏ Open (unstructured) callout
Email, Signal, Secure Drop, Mail, Twitter cards
❏ Extensions (intensive)
Bots, plugins, software
❏ In person
Events, workshops, meetings
❏ Study, join, organize digital communities that may lead you to sources:

Tips for making & using a [good] ​form​:
-Be specific, only ask for info you can use, use your questions to for filter cases you won’t use
-Be transparent about why you are interested in collecting this info
-Test the form with potential users for tone, language, format
-Leave the door open to stay in touch, make it clear that the form is just one way to connect
-Stay in touch with those who opted in, let them know how your project is going, most
importantly *keep asking questions*
-Make forms that can be answered by multiple users. Use conditionals to adapt. In this form,
we collected three different types of entries. The selection from this dropdown determined the
rest of the questions:

-Vet entries from the callout the same way you would verify and investigate any other source
Share your form [and entries] with other groups/ publications who can reach diverse audiences.
This is the same form [hosted by ProPublica] published with Cosmopolitan, The Root, Univision
and The Texas Tribune:

Most important: make journalism with the community you develop and share it back
