You’ve seen the Acrobat Reader files containing columns and rows of numbers waiting
to be analyzed. The problem: Acrobat files – ending with .PDF – can’t be directly read
(a.k.a. imported) by a spreadsheet (Excel) or database (Access) program. Now, there’s a
FREE tool to convert a PDF file into formatted text, ready to import into the application
of your choice, including a word processing program (Word) where you can do edits.

How to install the “PDFtoTEXT” or Xpdf software
(1) Make a folder on the hard drive of your computer. For our
example, we’ll call it “xpdf” so the full path or address is: C:\xpdf
(2) To download the software file, first go to the following Web
site: http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/download.html, then click
the “/pub/xpdf directory:” link and locate the following file to
download: xpdf-3.00pl3-win32.zip
OR go directly to this URL: ftp://ftp.foolabs.com/pub/xpdf/xpdf-3.00pl3-win32.zip
(3) Download the file into the C:\xpdf folder you
created on the hard drive of your computer in step 1.
(4) Unzip the file as you would unzip any compressed
file. The Unzip application should place the
PDFtoTEXT software files in a subfolder under your
C:\xpdf folder. The folders and files will look similar
to this screen shot from Windows Explorer:
Note: The path of the unzipped subfolder on the hard
drive is: C:\xpdf\xpdf-3.00pl3-win32

(5) For simplicity’s sake, move all the files from the
subfolder called C:\xpdf\xpdf-3.00pl3-win32 into
the main folder you created earlier: C:\xpdf. The
folders and files should now look similar to this:

That’s it – the software is now installed on
your computer!

How to use the PDFtoTEXT converter program
(1) Find a PDF file you want to convert. Ideally, the file is a simple table of columns and
rows; not that PDFTOTEXT can’t handle other types, but keeping things simple will save
some cleanup later. For example, you can download the following PDF file about
homeland security grants for practice. It contains three pages, each formatted differently.
http://www.dhs.gov/dhspublic/interweb/assetlibrary/Grants-ODP-04.pdf
Note: The name of the file is: Grants-ODP-04.pdf

(2) Save the file you’ve chosen into the same folder you created earlier: C:\xpdf.
Now, you’re ready to convert the content of the PDF file to text.
(3) Click Start Æ Run… and when you see the Run window, type cmd in the “Open:”
box, then click the OK button.

You’ll get this little command window (yours might look a little different):

(4) You’ll need to navigate to the correct folder using old DOS keyboard commands.
Here’s how: (4. a) If you start on the same drive, but have some folders identified as in
the example above, type cd.. then, (4. b) press the Enter key. Repeat these two steps until
you only get C:\> on the bottom line (take a look at the illustration, below).

(5) Now, change your directory to C:\xpdf with another “cd” command. Type: cd xpdf
then press the Enter key. Your screen should look something like this:

Now you’re ready to run a simple command on the file you downloaded earlier.

pdftotext –layout Grants-ODP-04.pdf

(7) Press the Enter key.
Let’s decode the command you just typed. By the way, C:\xpdf> simply identifies the
folder you’re looking into. The next part (pdftotext) is the name of the program you’re
telling the computer to use. The next part (-layout) is telling that program to use an
option to retain the appearance, spacing and all, of the PDF file you’re converting. The
last part (Grants-ODP-04.pdf) is the name of the file you have selected.
(8) When the conversion is done, the screen will take you back to the C:\xpdf> line. Type
“exit” then press the Enter key.
(9) Navigate to the C:\xpdf folder and there you’ll find a text file named
Grants-ODP-04.txt (or, what ever file name you’ve chosen)
Open it with Notepad, a word processing program that comes free with all versions of
Windows. Compare the original PDF tables with the text file and you’ll notice that the
layout is quite similar.
Note: Always print out at least part of the PDF so you can easily compare the two.

How to import a converted PDF text file into Excel
Note: If you used the practice file we suggested, you should run Excel’s “text import
wizard” three times since each of the three converted PDF pages contain tables that are
structured slightly differently. In other examples, especially if the converted PDF data
have lots of blank spaces, you’ll get a few numbers slightly off-kilter. A text word
processing program like Notepad, or even a fancier word processor like Microsoft Word,
can help you fix these types of problems.
(1) If the file you wish to import is open, close it. Open Excel.
(2) On the menu bar in Excel, click File Æ Open and navigate to C:\xpdf
(3) In the pop-up window, look for the “Files of Type” box near the bottom. Using the
drop-down arrow, choose “Text” so only files ending in .txt will be displayed. Click to
highlight your text file, then click the Open button. This will trigger Excel’s “Text
Import Wizard.” The wizard has three windows.
(4) In the first window of the wizard, Excel should guess correctly that the data are fixed
width. Note that below this, Excel will ask you where to start your import. By reading the
original PDFs, you’ll often choose to start below row number 1. In this case, let’s choose
to start at row 4, where the headers of the data begin. Click Next.
(5) In the second window of the wizard, a new dialog box allows you to make, delete or
adjust columns. Before you click Next, scroll down entirely. You’ll catch a couple of
problems. First, note that one of the “state” names, “Northern Mariana Islands,” is too
long. Click on the break line and move it to position 24. Second, note below that, there
are two other sets of numbers. For now, ignore them. We’ll have to deal with that
material in two more imports. Now, click Next.

(6) In the third window wizard window, it’s tempting to just click Finish BUT resist this
temptation and review a couple of things. This is the point at which you can made
decisions on whether a column should be labeled as text, a number or a date. “General”
means you’ll allow Excel to guess and it’s correct most of the time like in the case of
dollar amounts being imported as numbers. It’ll also correctly guess that state names are
text. However, if a column contains a number beginning in ZERO, you must change the
column’s label from “General” to “Number” otherwise any leading zeros will be lost
and you won’t be able to fix it later except by re-doing all of Excel’s “Text Import
Wizard” steps. The same thing is true with columns containing date data.
(7) Click Finish, and you’re almost there.
(8) Scroll down to row 62, and you’ll see that the second set of numbers is formatted
differently. So let’s get rid of those by clicking on the number 62 itself to highlight the
entire row, then while still holding the left mouse button down, scroll (drag) the mouse
pointer down the screen until you get to the bottom of the data area, highlighting each
row as you go. Release the left mouse button.

(9) On the menu bar, click Edit Æ Delete and the problem rows will disappear.
You’re done with the first page!
(10) Now, start another Excel workbook and use the Text Import Wizard again. Choose
row 71 and bring in the second set of numbers from page two. Make one more pass to
capture the third set on page three. After you’re finished, you’re a true expert!

Some caveats
 PDFtoTEXT won’t work at all if the file is a scanned image (for example, a 990
form from www.guidestar.org).

 If the file is encrypted, PDFtoTEXT won’t convert it. Some government agencies
are using Acrobat to password protect Acrobat Reader files in a way that prevents
you from doing a copy/paste. The PDFtoTEXT program will not “crack” an
Acrobat Reader file that is password protected. If you know the password, then
that’s another story: In these cases, PDFtoTEXT can help you.
 The more complicated the layout, the more text editing you’ll need to do later.

Advanced tips
 For more heavy-duty text editing, consider using UltraEdit (www.ultraedit.com)
or VEdit (www.vedit.com).

 For the ultra-geek information, read the accompanying text file called
pdftotext.txt, located in your C:\xpdf folder. Note that you can tell PDFtoTEXT

to start and stop at certain page numbers in the Acrobat Reader file.
