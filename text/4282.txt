Good
• Good organization creates follow-ups
• Use the tools you have:
• Microsoft Folders
• Outlook reminders

Microsoft Folder System – One example of an organization tool

This is what you see when you drill down into the “Aluminum Smelters” folder

• Good organization – creates follow ups
• Someone promises to get it to you “next week”
• Send them an email reminding them – keep the thread going to remind
them of your promise
• Set up an appointment reminder in your calendar

But don’t believe the IT staff when
they say – “Oh, everything gets
backed up every night!”

• Good stories don’t have to take long
• “Keep it simple” works:
• Police tag readers story
• Story began when a photojournalist asked
“What are those?”
