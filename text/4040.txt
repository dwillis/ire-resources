Fracking for Data
Data about oil and gas drilling

State:
Most state oil and gas agencies publish various amounts of data on their websites, starting with
production figures by state, county and well. Far fewer publish records of inspections, spills and
violations, but most keep those records. They should be provided on request or with an open
records request.
Enforcement records – fines, penalties, etc. – are a different story. Some states essentially don't
keep records. Most make enforcement information difficult to get, but it's worth getting.
Story ideas:
- How many spills have there been in your state or the counties you cover? What did state
or local officials do about it?
- Do your state and local officials fine drillers for health, safety and environmental
violations?
- Is there "frack" waste disposal in your area? How much is being injected? Has there been
an increase in earthquakes?

Federal:
The Energy Information Administration has lots of data, but the oil and gas production data tends
to lag. PHMSA and the Federal Railroad Administration make accessible on their website some
of the incident report data they keep. They have good interfaces for getting basic information
about incidents and accidents.
But PHMSA oversees only major interstate pipelines. FRA is only starting to wake up to the
amount of oil that is being transported by rail.
The National Response Center, run by the Coast Guard, is designed as a “one-stop-shop” for any
kind of spill or accident, offshore or onshore. NRC has a good state-by-state data download that
shows a lot of what's been called in and provides a lot of data. There can be a lot of detail, but
they aren't necessarily final reports. Some spills don't get confirmed and not every oil and gas
spill gets reported to NRC.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics provides the Quarterly Census of Employment and wages. It has
accurate (but lagging) data down to the county level, which is helpful because a lot of drilling is
in rural areas that aren't a part of MSAs.
Story ideas:
-

How much has crude-by-rail increased in your area? Have there been accidents in your
area or on the lines that lead into your area?
Where are the pipelines in your area? How many pipeline incidents have there been?
How much has production gone up or down in your area?
Groundtruth the jobs claims of companies and local officials?

Private:
FracFocus, a web registry of fracking chemicals maintained by a private non-profit, can be
helpful in some cases. But its creators made it intentionally difficult to use – PDFs only. Still,
FracFocus submits data in spreadsheets to state agencies. File open records requests to obtain it.
Baker-Hughes, a drilling services company, puts out a weekly "rig count" that is a good gauge of
drilling activity, down to the county level. The company has also started a "well count," showing
how many holes are getting drilled. The well count is recorded by basin, not state or county.
Story ideas:
-

Are companies filing on time? How do states make sure every company is reporting? Are
drillers frequently changing their filings?
Are job numbers, spills, etc. going up at the same rate as drilling? Faster? Slower?
