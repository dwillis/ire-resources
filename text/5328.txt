What is the data?
After losing a FOIA lawsuit, the Internal Revenue Service recently started uploading
machine-readable versions of forms that nonprofits file electronically with the
government each year.
Time frame:​ The IRS has posted forms processed since 2011. The forms are
uploaded monthly. (Note: There is typically a lag of a few months between the time an
organization files a return and it is processed by the IRS.)
Types of forms:
990 (may also be listed as 990EO or 990O)
990EZ (filed by smaller organizations)
990PF (filed by private foundations)
What’s not available:
990-N (filed by very small nonprofits with gross receipts of $50,000 or less)
Forms filed on paper
How many organizations file:
More than 378,000 organizations filed electronic 990s, 990EZs or 990PFs in 2016.
There are about 1.5 million nonprofits in the United States, though most forms on paper

or file the 990-N - basically a postcard asserting that they are too small to file a full
return. Churches are non-profits but do not have to file the forms.
The electronic data is typically required for organizations with at least $10 million in
assets and 245+ employees, though others also choose to file online.
Format:
Each form is posted on AWS web server in XML format (which looks a bit like HTML with all the data sandwiched between tags).
Here are some random examples of what the forms look like:
https://s3.amazonaws.com/irs-form-990/201722269349300317_public.xml
https://s3.amazonaws.com/irs-form-990/201742279349100209_public.xml
So the first portion of a form might look like this:
<Return xmlns="http://www.irs.gov/efile" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
returnVersion="2015v3.0" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.irs.gov/efile">
<ReturnHeader binaryAttachmentCnt="0">
<ReturnTs>2017-08-15T08:46:25-07:00</ReturnTs>
<TaxPeriodEndDt>2016-09-30</TaxPeriodEndDt>
<PreparerFirmGrp>
<PreparerFirmName>
<BusinessNameLine1Txt>SKEEN & CO CPAS</BusinessNameLine1Txt>
</PreparerFirmName>
<PreparerUSAddress>
<AddressLine1Txt>615A BROOKSIDE AVE</AddressLine1Txt>
<CityNm>REDLANDS</CityNm>
<StateAbbreviationCd>CA</StateAbbreviationCd>
<ZIPCd>92373</ZIPCd>
</PreparerUSAddress>
</PreparerFirmGrp>
<ReturnTypeCd>990PF</ReturnTypeCd>
<TaxPeriodBeginDt>2015-10-01</TaxPeriodBeginDt>

How to find the files:
The IRS also has posted two sets of indexes to the files, one in JSON and the other in
CSV. ***WARNING: Clicking on the JSON link my crash your browser. Access it via the
command line.***
The indexes follow this format:
https://s3.amazonaws.com/irs-form-990/index_2017.json

https://s3.amazonaws.com/irs-form-990/index_2017.csv
The JSON entries look like this:
{"EIN":"042662873", ​This is the tax ID for the charity, like a SSN
"TaxPeriod":"201603", ​This is the year/month corresponding to the end of the fiscal year
covered by the return
"DLN":"93493243000066",
"FormType":"990", ​Will also say “990PF” or “990EZ”
"URL":"​https://s3.amazonaws.com/irs-form-990/201612439349300006_public.xml​”, ​Path to the
XML that contains all the text in the 990

"OrganizationName":"ELKS BUILDING CORP OF NORWOOD",
"SubmittedOn":"2017-01-04", ​Date processed by the IRS
"ObjectId":"201612439349300006",
"LastUpdated":"2017-01-11T22:15:15"}
The CSV entries are slightly different:
RETURN_ID
14054169
FILING_TYPE
EFILE
EIN
42662873
TAX_PERIOD
201603
SUB_DATE
1/4/2017 10:27
TAXPAYER_NAME ELKS BUILDING CORP OF NORWOOD
RETURN_TYPE
990O
DLN
93493243000066
OBJECT_ID
201612439349300000
Note: The CSV index is missing the full URL
But it you can create it by using the OBJECT_ID
https://s3.amazonaws.com/irs-form-990/​ + OBJECT_ID + _public.xml
The IRS has posted some basic information here:
https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-makes-electronically-filed-form-990-data-available-innew-format
https://aws.amazon.com/public-datasets/irs-990/
Note​: Organizations sometimes file multiple forms in the same year, because they
have amended their returns or changed their fiscal year.

Understanding the tags:
Every field in the 990 form should be contained in the XML. (The data should be
identical to the data in the PDF version.)
The IRS has published some stylesheets online, such as this one:
https://www.irs.gov/e-file-providers/current-valid-xml-schemas-and-business-rules-for-ex
empt-organizations-modernized-e-file
Or you can just look at an example of the XML and search for the information you are
looking for. (Or compare it to a PDF version of the same form.)
Note: ​For yes and no questions, filers often use “0” or “False” to mean “No,” while “1”
and “True” mean “Yes.”

Pitfalls with the XML tags:
● The tags can vary between forms. So you might need to look for one tag for the
standard 990 form and a different one for the 990PF.
● Not all the tags are contained in every filing. So certain tags might be missing
(like the year an organization was formed) when organizations leave that entry
blank.
● The tags can vary between years. For instance, a 2016 filing uses the tag
<FormationYr>1994</FormationYr> for the year an organization was formed. A
2013 filing for the same organization would look like this:
<YearFormation>1994</YearFormation>. We agree, this is nuts.
● For notes in schedules, it’s even messier. Organizations typically just manually
note which part of the form the note goes with. But sometimes they put that
notation within different tags, write the line number differently, or shove notes for
different questions into the same item.
● Organizations sometimes make typos (including in the organization name or
EIN).
Some different approaches to harnessing the data:
Todd took this approach:

Wrote a program in Python to:
1) Download the CSV index files.
2) Use the index files to identify the URL and download all the XML filings
Then Todd wrote a separate program to:
Loop through all the XML files, grabbed key fields, and put them in new CSV data files
An example of the programs is available here:
https://github.com/TWALLACK/IRS
Andrea took this approach:
1) Download the JSON files with Python.
2) Parse JSON and put the information into a SQL table.
3) Get the URLS from the JSON files and download all the XML files
4) Parse all the XML using PHP.1 You will use this information:
a) Filename: the actual name of the file
b) Sequence Number: some tags will be repeated, i.e. names of directors.
Our code figures out if there are repeat tags.
c) Field Names: The tag and all of its parent tags. From our XML example
above, the city of the tax preparer would be
ReturnHeader|PreparerFirmGrp|PreparerUSAddress|CityNm
d) Value: The actual content of the tag (Redlands)
5) Write the above output to a TXT file and upload that file into SQL Server. This will
be about 1 billion records so you need a lot of space.
6) Make individual tables based on the field names you need.
Examples of stories we’ve written using the data:
Charity Officials Are Increasingly Receiving Million-Dollar Paydays
About 2,700 people had seven-figure pay packages at the nonprofits in 2014, a number
that was up a third in three years, newly searchable IRS data show
Data used​: Form 990, Schedule J, Part II

outstanding loans in fiscal 2014.
Data Used​: Form 990, Schedule L, Part II, Loans and/or From Interested Persons
Hundreds of People Made Gifts of Stock With Great Timing
Michael Milken was among hundreds of people who donated stock to charities near
price peaks or a few weeks before the stocks tanked, a Wall Street Journal analysis of
federal data shows. Such donations occurred more often than chance would dictate.
Data Used: ​Form 990PF, Schedule B, Part II, Noncash Property
Employee theft ‘shockingly common’ at nonprofits
More than 1,100 tax-exempt organizations nationwide have reported theft,
embezzlement, or other major diversions of assets over the past seven years, according
to electronic filings with the Internal Revenue Service.

● Propublica’s Nonprofit Explorer​ includes summary data for nonprofit tax
returns and PDFs of full Form 990 documents.
https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/
● CitizenAudit​, which has converted millions of 990s to text, is testing a new
feature to identify and download lists of nonprofits that have checkmarked certain
boxes on the forms. Offers discounted subscriptions to news organizations

le-extract-eo-bmf
● IRS Annual Extract of Tax-Exempt Organization Financial Data​. Contains key
fields for those nonprofits filing the 990, 990PF, and 990EZ. It will have the
answer to most yes/no questions in the return (is it a hospital, does it have bond
issues), as well as fields that ask for financial data (sources of revenue, types of

expenses). It does not contain information from any schedules, or any free-text
fields. ​For non-programmers, this is a really good bet to get started with
Form 990 data analysis.

● Microdata.​ Enhanced version of the previous data but only for select 990s.
Contains sample data from all of the largest charities and just 1% of small
charities. From 1985-2014, so this hasn’t been updated in a while. Contains
select schedules including J (Compensation), H (Hospitals), K (Bonds).
