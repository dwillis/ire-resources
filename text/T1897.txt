Problems while
reporting
Biggest problem was the law itself
- though under the purview of the
Drugs and Cosmetics Act,
clearances are easier to obtain
than allopathic drugs
n Anyone can make ayurvedic drugs
that are included in the 54 ancient
texts notified by the Government
n No licence required to sell
ayurvedic drugs

What we found
AIIMS Dept of Pharmacology study
of 120 ayruvedic preparations
showed 38 per cent had corticosteroids
n Govt does not require evidence
based trials of ayurvedic drugs –
since used for centuries, no need
for fresh tests
n Ashwagandha – Indian Ginseng –
includes
steroidal lactones

What is Nimesulide
Drug synthesised by US company 3M
Pharmaceuticals, Minnesota.
n But never used there.
n Commercially-sponsored and financed
trials showed the drug to be COX 2
selective inhibitor and hence gastroprotective
n Independent research at academic
institutions showed it to be a preferential
inhibitor and not gastro-protective

What is Nimesulide
Argument by industry – not issued in the
US because it was `out of patent’
n Drug cannot be out of patent at time of
discovery
n Nimesulide was then sold to Helsinn,
Switzerland, but never introduced there
n Licensed to Boehringer for introduction in
Italy in 1985
n Purpose of trans-Atlantic travel – locate
a country willing to let the drug be
launched.

Problems with the
second report

n

5/14/03

No home work done by the reporters – one
of whom is covering the pharmaceutical
industry
Premise of the second report – a specious
survey of a very small sample group
Reporters should have asked some tough
questions
Extrapolating the data of the survey
reveals – projected sale of Nimesulide in
one year should have been – Rs 2042.40
crore. Actual annual sales – Rs 182 crore,
discrepancy rate – 1122%

Behind the News
Nimesulide is sold under more than 90
brand names in India
n Though cost of manufacturing the drug
does not exceed Rs 5, it is sold for
anything between Rs 18 and Rs 29 (per
ten tablets)
n After the publication of the first report in
October 2002, shares of a
pharmaceutical company, whose
maximum earnings are from Nimesulide
sale, fell drastically

Behind the News
It is believed that the IMA `survey’ was
done at the behest of this company
n The report was `leaked’ to the health
reporter through the pharma industry
reporter
n Sunday was chosen as the day to write
the report since it is a lean day and there
are greater chances of a good display on
the front page

Pitfalls to avoid
There is bound to be a clash of interests
between the pharma industry and the
public good
n Newspapers should make it mandatory
for industry reporters to get a story like
this cleared by the health editor/ senior
health correspondent
n Reporters must always ask the question
: who gains from the story? In this case,
it was obviously the industry which
benefitted from the second story

Pitfalls to avoid
n

5/14/03

All data that is presented to you should
be scrutinised from all angles – the IMA
study should have been thrown out
simply because of the small sample
group
