Digging Deeper with
Data
IRE Philadelphia Watchdog Workshop

The good news
*Data is everywhere. Can I measure something? Is it recorded
somewhere?
*You don’t need a Ph.D. or even coding skills in the beginning.
*A lot of the tools you need for projects are probably already on
your computer.
*There is an incredibly supportive community of data
journalists who are always willing to help.

Missing Fugitives
Average of 63 days to arrest someone on a probation or
parole violation warrant in 17 of the country’s largest
counties
In our area, it took longer – an average of 81.7 days.
In other places, like Minneapolis, the average was a little over
half that – about 43 days.
