What is Web Scraping?
● The automated process of systematically pulling data
or information from a website using computer
programming or software
● Free all of the data
● When agencies claim that posting their data on
thousands of pages on a site means they refuse your
FOIA request, this is a great tool
bit.ly/whentoscrape

What can you scrape?
● Court search websites
● Online Property records
● School data
● Online police blotters
● Public employee directories
● Campaign finance data

Why scrape data?
● Despite posting data on its site, DC public schools didn't
have access to their own school testing data
● Web serving software made recalculations that fixed scores
as they were posted to site and were not reproducible by
school district
● Got help from DC schools in defeating a session
requirement and scraped the data
● The district and schools found out he had it and wanted it
for grants because they'd never had it before

Why scrape data?
● Automation
● Gateway to programming. You’ll eventually learn about:
○ HTTP
○ HTML and CSS
○ Servers
○ Scripting Languages (Python, Ruby, Perl, PHP, etc.)
○ Databases and Spreadsheets
○ Insanity

Scraping for journalism
● Create and analyze datasets that live on thousands of
pages on a website
● Create interactive graphics and web applications
○ ProPublica’s Dollars for Docs investigation is
powered by scrapers
● Get stories before anyone else
○ LA Times broke story in March on a major
earthquake using a bot to scrape USGS website

Before you scrape
● Always ask for the data
○ FOIA not always a necessity
○ Try to talk to the folks in charge of data
● There are probably people in your newsroom who can help
● Don't reinvent the wheel
○ See if someone else has already written a scraper

Before you scrape
● If it's one page, it's possible to copy/paste
● It’s easier to scrape if you know how a
website is made
○ Understanding HTML is a big plus
○ JavaScript, too

● Some sites are harder to scrape than others
bit.ly/whentoscrape

Scraping hurdles
● Not all websites are pretty
○ Missing tags
○ Dirty or difficult Javascript

● Forms can be funky
● Requests can time out
● Site admins can kick you off
● Website layouts change often

Scraping hurdles
● Websites change. ALL THE TIME.
● Scrapers often fail
● Your scraper will fail
● You may need to run your code more than once

Scrape responsibly
● Don't hit a site too hard
○ Difficult to differentiate from DDoS attack

● Scrape during off hours
● In Python, time.sleep() is your friend
○ Comparable options in other languages

● Use APIs when available
● Share your code

Using Excel
● California wouldn’t release Megan’s Law sex offender
database because the information was available online
● The web page address has parameters for each
California county. There’s a pattern.
● Using Excel string functions and a command-line tool,
we can download the webpages to our computer to
analyze

Using Excel

Using Excel
Columns: county (A), first (B), last (C), url (D)
Function in D2: =B2&A2&C2

Using Excel
● Copy and paste web addresses from column D into
text file and save it, e.g., megans-law-urls.txt
● Use wget to request each URL and download their
contents to your computer
