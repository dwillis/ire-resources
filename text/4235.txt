Go for accurate,
not “good enough”

No data are perfect

Just like we background check human
subjects of stories, we need to
background check our data

Integrity checks for every data set
• Read the documentation. Understand the contents
of every field.
• Know how many records you should have.
• Check counts and totals against reports.
• Are all possibilities included? All states, all counties,
correct ranges?
• Check for missing data, duplicates, internal
problems

Transparency in what we know
and what we don’t
• “Simply putting data online is not journalism, we need
to vet it and interpret it.”
• Do a detailed methodology about the data and the
process
• In cases of more complicated analyses, do a white
paper with your research output.
• Ask experts to review your analysis. Seek experts
with various interests/expertise.
• Invite feedback. Include a mechanism for folks to
submit changed

This should include stories, graphics,
maps and apps
• For example, if you’re mapping something and you
weren’t able to pinpoint the location of some of the
data – does that make the map inaccurate?
• Do you have a problem of “tiny Ns”? (Where the
population is so small that any change seems big.)

Watch your words
• Significant, likely and
correlation actually mean
something. Use them wisely.
• Beware the spurious
correlation
• While your analysis may
generate lots of Rs and Ps,
descriptives are easier to
readers to understand.

Source your
information

Watch your math

• Adjust money over time (a
dollar really doesn’t buy what it
used to)
• Use rates rather than raw
numbers
• Use median when averages
might be skewed

Database of 500 people
who had been granted or
denied pardons from list of
2,000
We found that even after
controlling for other
factors, whites were more
likely to get a pardon.

The Dallas Morning News
used a random sample of
non-capital murder cases
to build a database and to
study jury strikes:
1. Demographics
2. Voir dire
3. Socioeconomics

areas of the city”

Vetting your analysis

Gut check
What else could explain findings?
Did I fill in all possible holes?
Did I collect all the data I needed to
The analysis is just the beginning. Once I start
reporting is it consistent with findings?

Bust your own
assumptions

It’s so easy now

• Many outlets just use snippets of AP copy, or announce
just headlines based on the first one or two sentences.

• Then there’s climate change and insurance companies

The ethics of confusion

Deception is clearly unethical — but at
what point is likelihood of confusion
also unethical?

Clever graphics can
cause confusion

• Data visualization specialist Andy Kirk wrote a bit about
this on his blog:
• http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/2014/04/thefine-line-between-confusion-and-deception/
• As did PZ Myers, an associate professor at the University
of Minnesota, Morris:
