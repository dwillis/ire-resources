Processing
●

Condense your notes into what was most important

The name of the new library/package you want to learn to work with

Put those notes somewhere speciﬁc that you can reference in the future
○

I like the Stickies app on Mac
You may prefer Word or other ﬁles for notes

Practicing
●

Set aside time
○
○

●

Mark off time in your calendar daily, weekly, or with some kind of regularity
This is your data/coding time, the same way you dedicate other time in life

Re-do the lesson from your favorite hands-on session
○
○

You should do it again multiple times
If you get good at it, try the skill on another demonstration dataset

Putting it to use
●

Plan the one project that you want to do next
○
○
○

●

What skill from NICAR will you use to do the project?
How long will it take to ﬁnish?
Which members of your newsroom can you involve?

Don’t pressure yourself with planning too many projects
○

Manage your expectations given other responsibilities at work

Sharing
●

Schedule data/coding oﬃce hours
○
○

●

Mark off oﬃce hours
A low-pressure way to share your skills with your newsroom

Give brown bag presentations
○
○
○

Best if they’re already part of your newsroom culture
Can be a simple overview of what data journalism is
Can be your version of someone’s hands-on class
