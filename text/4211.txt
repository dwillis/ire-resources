STARTING STRONG


List your elements: Lay out all of the facts, figures, records, and information you know you’ll need
before you start writing. What are your key pieces of video, best interviews, documents/data,
confrontations, big interviews? Put your elements in the order you want to present them: It doesn’t
have to be chronological but it should be logical.



Identify your theme: Summarize your story in 1-2 sentences. How would you explain this story to your
mom? “Little old lady accused of scamming realtors.” “VTA employees get fired then rehired, putting
public safety at risk.” Write out the theme and refer to it often. Make sure the elements you include tie
back into your theme.



Write your heart out, then refine: Start writing fresh and write in the order of anchor intro, reporter
intro, package, tag so that your story flows from start to finish. If your story gets too long or it goes
beyond your main elements—consider putting extra information into the web article or even a second
story.



What’s the surprise? Every good story has a good surprise. Some are more shocking than others, but
it’s something you need to think about before you start writing.



Visualize: most of your stories are going to have numbers, figures or boring documents. Get with your
photojournalist and/or graphic designer to go over ideas on how you want these things to reveal.



Read your logs before you write or log your “victim” sound last: This can help you remember the
emotion and what they said so that you can better write into the soundbites.
(MORE ON THE BACK!)

MAINTAINING THE MIDDLE


Slalom: Hit your elements, move forward, and don’t go off course. Make sure each sentence advances
the story to the next point, and don’t stray from your main theme and elements.



Write the objective, let your interviews express the subjective: Set up the facts in your sentences and
let your subjects provide the opinions and emotion. “REPORTER TRACK: RECORDS SHOW MULTIPLE
PEOPLE FIRED FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE WERE RE-HIRED. Interview subject: ‘It’s ridiculous and I think
they’re putting people in danger.’”



Write out of soundbites: You can reiterate the point without being redundant by incorporating a
phrase or key words that your subject said.



The better the sound, the fewer the words: Let good characters do most of the story-telling.



Use questions: Before your interview, you know there are a set of simple questions you’ll need to ask.
Even if it’s not a hard hitting question, use those Q & A’s in the story if the answers are brief. Be
careful! Don’t add unnecessary questions.



“Ghost Producer:” Read your stories out loud to yourself and to trusted critics who will help you cut it
down. It will help you find spots in your story that are confusing or boring.



Don’t be so literal- It’s important to write to video, but that doesn’t mean you need tell viewers what
they’re looking at frame by frame.



Write tight: Make 1-2 points per sentence.

KILLER CONCLUSION


Have an ending: Don’t just trail off



Recapture your theme: End with a line or soundbite that ties back into your overarching message



Leave the viewer with a powerful image

TV TO WEB


Sexy Headlines: Be specific and hit keywords/proper names to help with searches “Sysco Corp. Stores
Food in Dirty Sheds” “NTSB: Asiana Pilots Confused”



Don’t transcribe your TV script for the web: Start the story with an active set up that grabs your
reader. In TV you leave breadcrumbs for people to follow as you reveal more and more; in web writing,
you need to top load.



Use different quotes in the web article: They may work better than the soundbites you used in the TV
version



Graphs/spreadsheets/charts/extra info: The web is the place you can put in elements you had to cut
from your TV story
