Bulletproofing in the heat of deadline

1)Put on a different hat. You are no longer the story cheerleader. You are now the libel
lawyer, the interrogator, the skeptic. Be tough. Accept nothing at face value. Consider
yourself the last line of defense for your employer.
2) Let the reporter know that you have a job to do and need adequate time to do it. Set a
deadline and make the reporrter stick to it. Make clear that it is NOT OKAY to give the
editor 15 minutes to move a complicated story that has taken all day to produce.
3) Examine as much of the original source material as time allows. The more familiar you
are with documents, the less risk of mistakes.
4) As a draft is taking shape, steal as many early peeks as possible. Take corrective action
early. Make notes of potential problem areas, incongruities in the copy.
5) Alert the lawyer if a story will come in later and need a speedy review.
6) Keep a list of every person, company and organization named in the story. Make sure
the reporter has made a wholehearted effort to contact ALL named parties before
publication. Ask exactly what steps they have taken and make clear is not enough to
leave a single phone message on a machine.
7) Scrutinize language for opinion and overreach.
8) Look at headline suggestions especially carefully. In attempts to be brief and catchy,
facts can become skewed..
9) Numbers should be rechecked against source documents. Call for help!
10) Work directly with the copy editor as story moves through the process. Encourage
them to ask as many questions as you did.
