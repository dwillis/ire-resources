Uncovering Waste and Fraud in
Local Government and Public
Authorities
In 7 Easy Steps!

1. Don’t Be Afraid to Stand By
Yourself

Goat

This isn’t you. It’s a goat.

You Might Be Lonely
• Chances are you’re the only one looking at
this.
• No one will be reading the documents.
• The only people paying close attention are
those who have a skin in the game.
• Politicians will be at ribbon cutting
ceremonies.
• They might even be …

Hanging out with goats

6/29/2011

This is the public persona our mayor
and leading city councilman were
putting on as behind the scenes our city
fell to shit.

Mindset: You’re the only hope
• Don’t expect anyone else to back you up.
• Become the expert.
• Be the one who knows it better than
anyone.
• Don’t worry about being the lone public
voice pushing something. It’s OK to be
alone.

2. Make Sure the Agency
Knows It’s Public
And make them think you’re not
standing alone

May Sound Weird but…

6/29/2011

They don’t act like it – outside City Hall

Public records
• I like to call up and explain a public
records request before I make it.
• But expect BS responses.
• Know the law yourself. Write your letters
like a lawyer does. Copy their language.
Cite caselaw.
• CC other people: Lawyers, the city
attorney, political opponents.

3. Get Creative!
Someone else might have what
you’re looking for

So you get stonewalled?
• So your state’s public records law has no
teeth?
• Where else can you turn?

Documents that are illegal to lie on
• Local governments have to file lots of
documents with the federal government.

990s – Nonprofit Tax Returns

6/29/2011

This is how we cracked the SEDC case

13

Where?
• Guidestar.org
• Your state attorney general
• The nonprofit agency itself

CAFR – Comprehensive Annual
Financial Report

6/29/2011

Should be available easily – for all
potential investors. Website. No
argument for keeping this secret.

15

You can’t lie on these documents
• So you find the truth here.
• Or, if you don’t, then you’ve got one hell of
a story, too.

4. Search for Relationships
There’s only so many people

Relationships
• Boards of directors
• Financial disclosures
• Accurint
• County recorder – land deeds.

5. Go Public

Start the Narrative
• If you can’t figure something but you know
it doesn’t add up, write about the mystery.
• Or if you’re in a struggle for information, go
public with it.

Or to fight a document fight
• If you're like me, you don't have a whole
lot of money for lawyers.
• You also don't have a newsroom of
hundreds of people to fill pages while we
fight records behind the scenes.
• And, if you're like me, you're not above
publicly shaming people to get public info.

We can get really annoying

6/29/2011

But we win

26

People love it
• You're taking people along with you on a narrative.
• Opening up the process to the public.
• You create content.
• Get people working on your behalf. Even lawyers
offering their work pro bono. Readers calling up
the agency and demanding it.
• It almost always works for us.
• You have to be careful because you don't want to
use it without being prepared to actually sue in the
end if they don't give it to you. It can't be an empty
threat.

6. Write With Authority

Applies to everything
• It goes back to the first point -- being an expert.
And also being on an island.
• Especially if you're doing rolling work, it's an
absolute must to find a storyline, find a narrative
and tie these pieces together for people.
• Don't expect people to connect the dots.
• And tell the world clearly when someone's defense
isn't backed up by the facts.
• Know your topic better than anyone. Don't just
assume they get their say and you can let it be.
They don't just get their say if what they say is BS.

7. Evangelize

Don’t be shy
• Proactively take your story to other news
orgs to partner. Beforehand.
• Get a bigger impact.
• And to make sure you get credit. Before it
gets taken away from you.
