Python mini boot camp at #NICAR14 in Baltimore
Let's use Wakari.io bundles for this class. At the end, we'll give you everything working in Github.
As a backup plan in case the internet is bad, we'll have the bundles on the machines, and we can use the
Anaconda distro of Python's interactive interpreter in Windows PowerShell.

Who are you, what do you do, what do you want to learn?
What will we learn
what can I do with it?
The goal of the day is to start to learn how to think about solving problems.
The Wakari bundle

Project #1
Start with a CSV. Let's write some basic scripts to see what we're working with. Then we'll introduce some
key Python types like strings, integers, lists, slicing and loops. After a white board exercise, we'll start with a
file of pseudocode, and we'll walk through writing the program in Python code, running the file at the
command line. We'll hold your hand through it, step by step.

Project #2
We have a CSV of baseball player salaries. Let's figure out who makes the most money and examine some
other biographical information about them, using dictionaries.
LUNCH

How to debug your code, aka "Google and StackOverflow are your new best
friends"
Project #3
This section covers webscraping with Python using a get request, writing the data to a CSV.

Project #4
Let's use an API to get information programatically to create a spreadsheet. Our data comes in a new
format: JSON. Show on the whiteboard how it's basically a combination of data structures we already know
about: Lists and dicts (arrays and objects).
At the end of the day, we'll send you home with with:
A lightning dash through basic variables, types and functions.
the working, commented code for each project from our git repo
a walkthrough for setting up your machine at home with Python, version control and virtualenvs.
Good libraries to explore with strong tutorials
lifetime support guarantee from us & PythonJournos

Help!
If you're working through this code at home and have trouble, please let us know. The best option is to file an
issue report of the bug so we can help you. You can also reach out to any of us on Twitter or ping
PythonJournos.
