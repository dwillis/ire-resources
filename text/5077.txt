Regression
• OLS: Ordinary Least Squares Regression
• Looks at how much of one variable
(independent) explains the variation in
another variable (dependent)
• Poverty and school test scores
• Demographics and crime

Regression
• When you run a regression, you get a result
called an R-square. That tells you much the
independent variable predicts the dependent
variable.

Regression
• It also allows you to “adjust” the data or to
see if entities are doing better or worse than
they should given the independent variable.

• For our test scores example it controls for
poverty levels to see if schools are doing
better or worse than they should given their
level of poverty.

The Math
• The regression calculation is based on the
formula for a line: y=mx+b
• In our school test score analysis, y is the
predicted score, x is the poverty rate, m is the
slope of the line (how much a change in
poverty explains a change in score). b is the yintercept – where the line crosses the y axis.

An alternative to Excel
• Excel can do some statistical functions, but it’s
pretty clunky. There are lots of stats programs
out there, such as Stata, SPSS and SAS, but
they are pretty pricey.
• A free alternative is PSPP, which can be
downloaded here:
http://www.gnu.org/software/pspp/

Open PSPP

Open Data Using “Open” Command

Choose the data file you want to open.

Celebrate your data’s successful arrival
into PSPP.

Check Out Your Variable View

Check out your data view, too.

Prepare to do your linear regression:
Analyze/Regression/Linear
:

Choose your Dependent and
Independent Variables.

Think about which variable whose
outcome you want to predict.

Click OK

Confirm the variables analyzed.

Look for R and R Square

Repeat the Process with Other
Variables.

Track The History of Your Analysis …

• That way, you can see which variable is more
influential.
• And when you’ve found that information …
• You

And Celebrate with Kool and the Gang.

•Now let’s do it with
the other datasets!!!
