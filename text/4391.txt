Do integrity checks from your desk

Beware duplicates
Every time Saint Paul, Minn.,
housing inspectors made followup visits to check on violations, all
of the data entries from the
previous visit were logged again.
So every violation was listed in the
database multiple times.

Beware dates
Did 592,000
people in Ohio
really vote before
they registered?

Do integrity checks from your desk

Does it make sense?
(a/k/a: The case of the disappearing lifers)

“We select things for publication
just to make available a wide
scope of data to the public ...
There is some burden on the
public to decide whether or not to
use the material.”
--Kathleen McGuire,
Sourcebook of Criminal Justice Statistics

Do integrity checks from your desk

Do the data conform
to the real world?
Are half of the records male,
half female?
In a national data set, are
about 13 percent of the
records from California?
Are racial minorities
adequately represented?

Do integrity checks from your desk

Check for patterns
in missing data.
Do patterns render
estimates inaccurate?

Think like a statistician
a/k/a: How George Will became
the darling of statistics teachers
"In 1992-93, none of the five states with the highest teachers'
salaries were among the 15 states with the highest SAT scores.
And the 10 states with the lowest per pupil spending included
four . . . among the 10 states with the highest SAT scores."
--George Will, 1993

Statistical checks: From the simple to

Descriptive statistics:

R-squared = .82
ss2 = 43 + 0.95(ss1)

Beware the documentation
(Find a power user, and compare notes.)
Yes, that’s Harold Spaeth’s view and
mostly I think he’s right, though I’d
substitute the word more “efficient”
for more “accurate.”
--Lee Epstein

What’s
missing?
(ask the keepers
of the data)

An estimated 30
percent of felony
convictions are
missing from the
Minnesota public
convictions file.

Check those codes
(a/k/a: The codes are not what they seem)
(a/k/a: Why to pull some paper records)
Data spanned six years. Sometime
in those six years, the violation
codes changed. No one in the
Housing Violations Bureau knew
when the switch was made, and
no one had definitions for the
previous codes.

Do integrity checks with other sources

Beware
elements
of change
(a/k/a: Why to pull
some paper records)
The “feename” – name
of the property owner –
in the Saint Paul Housing
Bureau’s code violations
database is pulled in
from property tax rolls. It
shows the current
owner. That person may
not have owned the
property at the time of
the violation.

Summarize cases by institutions,
then spot check results.
Is it true only 6 percent of hospital emergency cases
are transferred from other hospitals?

Beware nulls!

Beware nulls!

We want to explore reports involving Promus heart
stents , but NOT the Promus Element devices.
First, let’s see what’s in there for Promus.

Technology bites

Beware nulls!
There are 50 records that mention Promus.
We can see by scrolling that four are the
Promus Element that we wish to exclude.

Beware nulls!

Let’s get rid of those Elements.

You’re supposed to have 46 records, but you
got 30. What are the missing 16 records?

As you report and just before you publish

Don’t alter
original data.
Make a copy of the
original data file. Put it
somewhere and don’t
touch it again.
Don’t edit an original
column or field. Make a
copy and edit that.

As you report and just before you publish

Document
as you go
As you integrity
check your data,
annotate the
queries to
remember what
you learned.
Keep track of all of
your queries so you
can retrace your
steps or find where
you went wrong.

As you report and just before you publish

Cross check
If you’re summing, do a list. Make sure there‘s nothing
wacky in that list that would cause your count to be
wrong; e.g., duplicates.
If you have various data sources that should yield the
same conclusions, do they?
If you summed data in SQL, can you reproduce the results
in a pivot table?

As you report and just before you publish

Beware the single case
Never report on one data record without pulling the
paper report or talking to the person in question.
What if it was a data entry error?
What if there are circumstances you don’t understand?

As you report and just before you publish

Recreate the wheel
For every fact, number,
finding in your story,
write an original query or
formula to support it.
Go back to your original
data.
Try to arrive at the same
conclusion in different
ways.

Fear is your friend
