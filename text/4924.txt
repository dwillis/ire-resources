DIVERSITY: WHAT IS IT AND HOW DO YOU MEASURE IT?
Diversity is sometimes confused with “minority/non-minority” – it is not
the same thing. Diversity is all about the mixture of people, and when
measuring diversity, what we’re after is literally the chance that two
people chosen at random from the population will be different.

DIVERSITY: WHAT IS IT AND HOW DO YOU MEASURE IT?
The use of diversity measures in journalism was pioneered in the early
90s by Phil Meyer of the University of North Carolina and Shawn
McIntosh of USA Today. For the formula, you calculate the percentage of
the total for each group, sum the squares, and subtract it from one.

In MySQL, for example, the formula looks like this, where w= White,
b=Black, h=Hispanic, a=Asian, na=Native American,o=Other, ttot=Total
diversity=(1(POW(wtot/ttot,2)+POW(btot/ttot,2)+POW(htot/ttot,2)+POW(atot/ttot,2)
+POW(natot/ttot,2)+POW(otot/ttot,2)))*100
WHERE ttot>0

SEGREGATION: WHAT IS IT AND HOW DO YOU MEASURE
IT?
Segregation measures look at two groups and determine the extent to
which they are apart. This is done by taking the overall population of the
two groups in a given place (such as a metropolitan area) and then
assessing how individual neighborhoods (such as Census Tracts)
compare to the total.

In other words, if the mix of Whites and Blacks in a metropolitan area is
75-25, the formula assesses how close individual neighborhoods in the
metro match the overall mix. Professor Michael Rosenfeld of Stanford
posted some examples (https://web.stanford.edu/~mrosenfe/)

Download Professor Rosenfeld’s spreadsheet to learn more about the
formula, but the quick explanation:
Each row generates a coefficient:
=ABS((B113/B$101)-(C113/C$101))
Translated: For each neighborhood, we’re calculating the percentage of
all whites that live there and subtracting the percentage of all blacks
that live there.

Then to calculate the index score itself:
=SUM(E91:E100)*0.5*100
Translated: This is the sum of each neighborhood’s coefficient,
divided by two because there is two groups, and multiplied by 100 to
convert into a whole number. If the result is, say 75, it means that 75
percent of group members would have to move to a different
neighborhood to achieve perfect integration.

DISPARITY: WHAT IS IT AND HOW DO YOU MEASURE IT?
On the face of it, measuring disparity is as simple as quantifying the
difference between groups in whatever category you’re reporting on. But
there are still factors to keep in mind, both statistical and journalistic.

DISPARITY: WHAT IS IT AND HOW DO YOU MEASURE IT?
First and foremost, you need to consider whether the differences you’ve
measured are significant. There is statistical significance, which you can
calculate with a formula, but also common sense – if test scores in your
city are two percentage points higher for one group compared to
another, the difference might be statistically significant, but is it
meaningful? What about a difference of five points?

This table shows the racial distribution of inmates sentenced to solitary
confinement at the Clinton Correctional Facility in 2015, compared to
the overall inmate population. As you can see, white inmates got sent to
solitary at much lower rate:

The difference seems large and obvious. But what if somebody wanted
to argue there were only a 402 SHU sentences, the disparity could have
happened by chance. For a better explanation of the math, see
http://www.biostathandbook.com/chigof.html. Using the “goodness of
fit” spreadsheet on this page, let’s look at a data example how to assess
this:

Chi-square analysis tells you likelihood the difference is by
chance…

An important technique for any data analysis is to
“account for” other variables. Example: Does the racial
disparity you find hold up for all age groups or is it
concentrated among young people?

Start with your total population, then look at the
components. Social scientists – and journalists – often
conduct regression analysis to account for multiple
factors at once.

Another thing to consider is scale. All 5-point differences are not alike.
It’s important to consider the natural scale of what you’re looking at.
What are the lowest values? What are the highest?

Using school data as an example, if you look at, say, school-level test
passing rates, you’ll probably see a range of something like 30 to 90 – a
very normal distribution. But if you look at school attendance rates, the
range might be from 85 to 99 – much more compressed, and therefore,
a five point difference could be much more significant.

Therefore, a lot of social scientists prefer to “standardize” data into a
common scale. One of the most common techniques is to use “zscores”. Z-scores measure the distance a number is from the average
value in standard deviations. See
https://github.com/gebelo/gijc/blob/master/Z-Scores.ppt for more
information.

One last piece of advice: Show, don’ tell. Instead of characterizing the
disparity with adjectives (LARGE, HUGE, MASSIVE etc.), give readers the
actual numbers.

Many people assume residential segregation is
closely related to income disparity – that blacks and
whites in particular live apart mostly because of
income differences.
To test this, we calculated segregation indexes for
all U.S. metros but for all income levels
