WE’RE ALL IN IT TOGETHER. The subprime mortgage crisis showed
how disastrously interconnected individuals are to financial institutions
and Wall Street firms. Our economy is similarly interdependent. The
magic formula: Connect the dots, explain and localize.
Example: “The United States of Subprime,” WSJ, 10/11/07. Article at

THE BIG PICTURE IS OVERWHELMING, SO ZOOM IN. Most
nationwide economic indicators can be drilled down to the county and
local level. Experts can help you make the leap between big and
small, zero in on the right data and explain in plain English.
Here are some especially helpful brains:

Examples: “’Youth Magnet’ Cities Hit Midlife Crisis; Few Jobs in Places Like
Portland and Austin, but the Hipsters Just Keep on Coming,” WSJ, 5/16/09. “Many
Smaller Cities Dodge Crunch in Consumer Lending,” WSJ, 3/30/09

--Bureau of Labor Statistics regional economists (unemployment, pay
and benefits, consumer prices),

--Federal Reserve: Beige Books, published eight times per year at
http://www.federalreserve.gov/fomc/beigebook/2009/default.htm, bring
macro-level analysis of manufacturing, retail spending, labor
conditions and real estate down to a regional level. Directors of
regional Fed banks are eyes and ears at a local level, such as at the
Jacksonville, Fla., branch:

GO WHERE THE BODIES WILL BE BURIED. Bringing the dismal
science to life requires an obsession with finding examples of

caught in the economic tornado. Challenge everything we were raised
to take for granted: You can go to college, you can save enough for
retirement, you will have a job or find another one quickly, etc.

the bank shaky. Go to

of Capitalism; Regulators Fell One Bank, Spare a Rival,” WSJ, 4/24/09

--Pensions, endowments and government agencies: Find out what’s
sinking the returns on their investments, and the impact on everyone
who depends on them. Credit-rating agencies are an excellent source:
Moody’s, 212-553-0376; Standard & Poor’s, 212-438-6667, and Fitch
Ratings, 212-908-0526.
Examples: “Big-City Skyscraper Burns Ozark Town,” WSJ, 6/4/09. “New York
Looks to Address Pension-Fund Losses,” WSJ, 5/30/09. “Big Moan on Campus:
Bond Downgrades,” WSJ, 5/29/09

--Companies: Which employers are dumping jobs, and how is that
connected to the global economy? How are real people affected when
companies are whipsawed by the economy?
