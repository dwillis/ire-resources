The BIG IDEA

The Reveal

Is your idea original?

What mysteries does it solve?

What myths does it bust?

Summary of facts

Summary of facts

So what?

Impact
(Journalism for the public good)

A small group of lawyers and its outsized influence at the Supreme Court

The Echo Chamber
A REUTERS SPECIAL REPORT

http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/scotus

Eight lawyers

accounted for

20 percent of all arguments by private
attorneys in the last 10 years

The incredible shrinking bar

In the decade before, 30 lawyers
accounted for that same share of arguments.

So what?

Nine years
10,000 appeals
17,000 lawyers

66 lawyers accounted for 43 percent of the cases the court agreed to hear

Cool!

So what?

Of the 66 most successful lawyers,
51 worked for firms that primarily
represented corporate interests.

In cases pitting the interests of
customers, employees or other
individuals against those of
companies, an elite attorney was
three times more likely to launch
an appeal for business than for
an individual.

Who will be outraged?

Who will be held accountable?

Who will be helped?

Will government investigators
pick up where you left off?

What debate will your story reshape?

What laws might get passed
or changed?

Prove it.

Statistics, data
Documents
Interviews
Inspections, observations

Vindicated by DNA, but a lost man on the outside………..

How gettable is the proof?

What’s your minimum story?

Compared to what?

21 states
Yielded 3,000 neighborhoods

Tell me a story.

Is there a natural narrative?

Are there victims or main characters?

Are the main characters compelling?

Or . . .
Is it a story you’ll tell through examples?

Or . . .
Will your findings bear the weight
of the storytelling?

All told, from 2003 to 2011, the USDA
guaranteed at least 51,600 mortgages,
totaling at least $6 billion, for people
who lived in areas deemed urban by the
2000 U.S. Census, according to a Reuters
analysis of Census Bureau data and
mortgage lenders’ regulatory filings.
