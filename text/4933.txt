“Adventures in Pretrial Diversion”
or
“Pretrial Diversion in Adventure”

How does a piece like this come
together in a newsroom?
What have I learned so far about this
one particular form?
What am I still trying to figure out?

“Clickventures”

The Prosecutor’s Deal,
the Defendant’s Dilemma
https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/12/us/law-quiz-criminal-justice.html

Help readers understand the
complexity of pretrial diversion and
the issues in play.
Give people an experience of how
disorienting the process is, how heavy
the choices are, and what kind of toll it
can take on you.

Making these things is hard.

But technically making them is
kind of hard too.

Other challenges?
Design and art.

And editing. So much editing.

What have I learned so far about this
particular form?

Beginning, middle, and end.

Readers make choices that can do
two things:
● Define the given circumstances
● Move the story forward

Every choice should have
consequences.

Every consequence should be backed
by reporting, and should open up the
world of the story a little more.

Sometimes chance should probably
play a part.

Pacing is tricky, but important.

How could we have made the experience more
vivid?
How much further could one push? Could a
piece like this be the main event rather than a
supplement? How long is too long?
What other opportunities are there to surface
compelling reporting without bogging down
the piece? (Pullquotes? Photos?)

Is this a good idea at all?

Yes, it’s hard, but don’t be discouraged. It’s
also fun and exciting.
Can I do it right now? Possibly. Possibly not.
Will I be able to do it easily soon? Maybe. If
other adventurers keep trying things out and
eventually prove that this is a form worth
writing in.
