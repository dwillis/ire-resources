Navy Safety Center: Naval Aviation Safety Database

Data contains more than 48,000 “reportable events” since Jan 1, 1980, ranging from minor no-cost, nodamage problems to loss of aircraft and crew. None of the conclusionary narrative fields are included. The
short summary included has no conclusions. There are no names or personal identifiers. Aircraft
tailnumbers are included and allow identifying multiple events for the same aircraft.
We got 97 data tables with 807 variables. But data was suppressed in 218 fields because of privacy and
national security.
There are three primary key fields – events, persons and planes, plus several subsidiary key fields for some
detail tables.
Suggested table joins:
Explore specific aircraft tailnumbers or aircraft models:
Select records from AV_INVLVD_ACFT, then join to AV_RPRTBL_EVENT,
AV_EVENT_SUMMARY and AV_INVLVD_PER by field rprtbl_event_serl.
Then use field invlvd_acft_serl to join to tables AV_ENG_MODEL, AV_TD_NON_COMPL,
AV_ACFT_DMG, AV_REQN_OSTNDG, AV_DPRTR_LOCN,
AV_MAINTN_DEVN,
AV_INCDT_OCCURN, AV_ACFT_STAT, AV_ACFT_HIST, AV_IMP, AV_ENG_CMPNT,
AV_HAZS_FORN_OBJ, AV_POWER_LOSS, AV_CMPNT_SEPD, AV_CNDNL_INSPN,
AV_FLUID_SMPL,
AV_IMP, AV_FUSLG_DFORMN, AV_IMP_TER, AV_IMP_OBST,
AV_CRASH_SEAT, AV_MODE_OF_FLT, AV_MISHAP_TER, and AV_SUPPML_LIGHT.
Detail pilot and aircrew information:
Select records from table AV_RPRTBL_EVENT, then join to AV_EVENT_SUMMARY,
AV_EVENT_LOCN and AV_ACFT_STAT
by field event_rprtbl_serl. Next use field invlvd_per_serl to join with tables
AV_EVENT_PER, AV_INJ, AV_BKGRND, AV_TNG and AV_EJECTION. Finally, use filed inj_serl to
join table AV_INJ_CAUSE.
For counting frequencies of aircraft problems, choose the events of interest as above, then join these tables
and create new variables as needed to count their actual incidence and overcome the multiplication effects
of the joins:
Join tables AV_RPRTBL_EVENT, AV_INCDT_OCCURN, AV_INVLVD_PER, and AV_ENG_CMPNT
by field rprtbl_event_serl. Then join these tables, AV_TD_NON_COMPL, AV_REQN_OSTNDG,
AV_MAINTN_DEVN, and
AV_ACFT_HIST by field invlvd_acft_serl.

Decoding nested codes:
Table AV_ENG_CMPNT provides details on the aircraft parts that were involved in events and on the type
of damage or failure. The variable IMC_C is a five-character variable that describes the material or
component involved in a problem. The first character codes the major section of the aircraft such as

airframe or brakes. The second and third characters code the subsection, such as fuselage. The fourth and
fifth characters code the specific area, such as “landing gear attachment”.
Some code descriptions are not unique to an aircraft section or subsection and can thus give misleading
information, or hide information, is they are simply tallied as presented in the decode table. An example is
“A0198”, “not elsewhere coded” and “A0199”, “undetermined”. The “A” indicates that it is an airframe
component and “A01” shows it is the fuselage. Both of the details would be missed because the fivecharacter code in the data would translate to meaningless information.

See selected slides from PowerPoint presentation on following pages:

Finding Answers
• Joined 10 tables by three different key
fields to profile pilots
• Joined 27 tables by two different key fields
to detail crashes
• Created special table for counting deaths,
costs and problems by joining singleinstances of fields from 8 tables

Analysis Issues
• No denominator = No percentages
• A multitude of code tables and codes
• 2-level and 3-level hierarchical codes
– There are 5,678 codes for components
• 295 codes translate into “bearing”
• 253 codes translate into “wiring”

– Similar ambiguity with failure causes
• “Murphy’s Law” appears 42 times

A Simple Question
• “What percent of crashes involve engine
problems?”
• Requires several steps
• To provide a simple answer

But Difficult to Summarize
• Not all “events” include plane component
data
• Some “events” include data for multiple
components
• Dividing component instances by total
“events” gives the wrong answer
• Solution: create a PARTS field to identify
whether component data is present

• The counts for PARTS = YES provides
denominators for percentages

Summarizing – Part III
• Next you have to categorize the parts
• And aggregate them
• Notice that one-of-a-kind parts problems
predominate
• And jet engine problems lead the list of
repeat offenders

Summarizing – Part IV
• Using the “real” denominators
• It is possible to calculate the actual
percentage incidence of problem parts
• Jet engines, fuel systems and flight controls
come into focus
