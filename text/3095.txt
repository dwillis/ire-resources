SHIFTING GEARS:
INVESTIGATIVE LIFE AFTER NEWSPAPERS

1. DON’T BE AFRAID. You’ll find a way to practice good investigative
journalism, as long as you keep your passion.
2. YOU CAN MAKE AT LEAST SOME INCOME FROM WRITING. Pick up the
handout on grants. The Society of Environmental Journalists always has grant
programs listed on its website. Check Editor & Publisher. Checkout the
thousands of newsletters and blogs for your area of expertise. Read Writer’s
Digest, Publishers Weekly.
3. FIND A WRITER’S ASSOCIATION OR GROUP. In the DC area, we have
Washington Independent Writers. Should be a number of groups in bigger cities
and university towns. Great sources for freelance tips and moral support.
4. CHECK OUT CONFERENCES (NOT WRITERS’). Get story ideas at
professional conferences for areas that interest you: environment, business,
defense, etc. Good source for freelance story ideas and networking.
5. SO YOU WANT TO WRITE A BOOK—THINK LONG AND HARD. Your
first book may not make much money (or any at all). Finding an agent could take
time, a publisher even longer. Writing conferences sometimes have agent
roundtables where you can make contacts. Check out the agents who handled
books you admire. You don’t need an agent to be published by an academic press.
6. SO YOU WANT TO WRITE A BOOK—IF YOU DON’T, YOU’LL REGRET
IT UNTIL THE DAY YOU DIE. Despite the many obstacles, writing a book can
be valuable—for you and the world at large. Many investigative journalists have
years of background in a topic. They are trained to be objective, and importantly,
accurate. The world needs more fair-minded nonfiction books with a narrative arc
of several years or longer, giving readers valuable perspective.
7. TRY OTHER KINDS OF WRITING. Your own writing will improve. Take a
fiction or mystery-writing class. Or shoot for the moon and try screenwriting.
Story Sense by Paul Lucey is a great guide. Many investigative journalists have
stories that could be turned into a movie, or at least a TV show episode. You’ll
need a good story of intrigue, struggle, triumph built around one compelling main
character.
8. HAVE FUN. You’re free of corporate machinations now. You’ll write better,
have better story ideas, and you can follow your heart and mind to the best
journalism of your life.
