Bluefin: A $4 Billion Black Market

How We Did It
• 12 reporters from Spain to Japan
• Crosschecked vessels registry with black lists
• Extensive record searches in 10 countries: court
cases; corporate data; government investigations.
• FOI in the EU
• CAR analysis
• Hung out at the docks in France, Spain, Croatia,
Malta, Tunisia A LOT

How Big is the Bluefin Black Market?
• Compared official quotas to official catch
• Calculated average yen‐per‐ton price
• Calculated annual value of illegal catch
• Added up all years
ÆUS$400 million black market
Æ1 in 3 bluefins was caught illegally

The Tracking System that Can’t Track
Æ75% purse seiner catches missing crucial data
Æ118,000 ghost tuna –no export data
Æ96 shipments could not be tracked to any
company
ÆMore than 12 ranches killed more tuna than
they acquired (no, tuna don’t reproduce at
ranches)

Findings
• Supply chain riddled with fraud, negligence
and criminal misconduct
• Fishermen blatantly violated quotas
• Officials colluded with Industry
• Sea ranches epicenters for laundering tuna
• Tracking system full of holes
• Widespread, off‐the‐book trade in Japan since
mid‐1980s

Challenges
• Secrecy and official cover‐up
• Rough business environment
• Legal threats
• Working effectively across cultures

Impact
• Coverage in more than 400 outlets, blogs and
websites in 14 languages
• Forced French officials to respond to
allegations of doctoring numbers
• Tracking system will be revamped
