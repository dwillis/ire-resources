Starting up:
Lessons Learned in Creating Investigative Centers
Getting ready to launch
-- Determine whether there's a need for your organization, and who your audience is.
-- It takes longer than expected.
-- It's okay to start small. Collaboration and community building will make all the difference.
-- Be seen and heard. Make yourself available for interviews, seek ways to get your organization
mentioned by other media, use social networking, meet over coffee or lunch, set up a booth at trade
shows. Host MeetUps with local organizations.
-- Decide what order to begin: Should you start with the content in order to do the fundraising or start
with the fundraising in order to do the content?
-- The incorporation and 501(c)(3) processes both take a lot of time and require a lawyer and there’s
expense involved. Use your sources: Contact the state Bar or a law school in your area and ask them to
help you or reach out to attorneys on your sources list and ask them to do this pro bono.
-- What role do you want your board to have? What kind of people do you want on the board? Having
journalists on the board helps with issues regarding journalism, but they don’t necessarily fundraise
for you; having community members can help with fundraising but they don’t necessarily understand
journalism. Having a CPA on your board will increase the quality of your financial reporting and will
assure funders that money is being tracked properly.
-- Find the major gaps in media coverage in your market area and fill them.
-- Complete as much planning as possible before leaving another job to devote your full attention to the
start-up.

-- Just start publishing, do not wait until everything is perfectly in place because this will take a long time
and may never happen.
-- Reach out to academic institutions for support; it may be quicker and steadier than grants to get started.
-- Realize the project will require a lot of sacrifice from founding members.

Use ‘best practices’ in shaping your editorial content
-- Adopt ethics and employee conduct standards, and don’t forget to address social media.
-- Adopt a fact-checking system to bolster the accuracy of your stories.
-- Let collaboration bloom in many forms, from assisting with a public-records request to a full-blown
joint investigation.
-- Acquire legal advice (pro bono if possible) for pre-publication reviews of content, as well as for review
of contracts (compensation agreements, membership agreements, office rentals, etc.).
-- Consider adopting a policy that prohibits or regulates involvement of the board and donors with
editorial content.
-- Consider defining your specialty: You can’t be everything to everybody.
-- Even if your team is small, always have a second editorial member edit your stories.
-- Distribute your stories to as many mainstream media outlets as you can for their use requiring credit, it
is a great and free marketing tool.
-- Consider building volunteers into your business model.

Financial operations: Insist upon transparency
-- Protect the integrity of your journalism by adopting a fundraising and revenue policy that insists upon
transparency.
-- Hire an accountant as early as possible.
-- Learn how to reach out to foundation program officers, who will influence your organization's chances
of obtaining grants.
-- Accept the fact that "Fundraising is hard" (don't cold call, establish relationships, do your homework).
-- Don't rely only on grants (develop other revenue streams, including earned income).

-- Invest in insurance (libel, officers and directors, property).
--Make a realistic budget from supplies down to copying costs and document fees.
--You need significant development ability on your board and a development committee should be
formed as soon as possible.

Administrative and technical issues also are key
-- Understand that your website is a critical piece of your editorial, marketing and fundraising operations,
so it's worth the time and money to do it right.
-- Devise a system for prioritizing your tasks.
-- Create a private wiki to house basic documents for your organization, including materials for the board
of directors and other insiders.
-- Focus upon metrics -- measurements that will help you and potential funders assess the reach and
impact of your organization’s work.
-- There’s strength in numbers. Consider joining the Investigative News Network and a local or state
nonprofits association to learn new skills, draw upon others’ expertise (at IRE and other organizations
including state associations of nonprofits) and benefit from group buying power.
--Recognize that the administrative, financial and fundraising burdens will take up far more of your time
that you would like, eating into content production
--This area can be very frustrating, especially when resources are scarce: Do you dedicate them to
administrative and fundraising tasks or to publishing? In order to get the funds you need to be publishing,
and in order to publish regularly you need the funds.
