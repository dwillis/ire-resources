Great stories are hiding in
plain sight — in academic
papers.

But you need help from the
authors to both understand
the research and present
the results.

Step 1: Read the paper(s).

Sometimes the data is
already freely available.

Hint: Older papers can still
be newsworthy!

Step 2: Learn as much as
you can about the data and
technologies used in the
research.

Step 3: Contact the
researcher. Get on a plane
if you can.

Once you get the data,
make sure it matches the
paper!

depth

Think about how to make
the findings accessible to a
wider audience.

• Color
• Labels
• Annotation
• Context

Where is the coastline
in these maps?

Adding context

Question some things that
are standard practice in
academia.

Keep a dialog open as you
work, and share your
progress (without
compromising editorial
integrity).

Sometimes the point you
want to make with the data
is broader or different than
what the paper does.

Write about what you did and
share it with researchers

Thank you!
