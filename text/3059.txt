Abused Children
Some basic information about dead children who are the subject of past
abuse and neglect allegations is generally released by the Texas Department of
Child Protective Services. You have to know the child’s name and as much
information as possible before you call.
However, you will not be able to get a database of all children who have
died from abuse.
If the case involves a critically injured abused child, information is treated
as if the case involved a dead child and general information, including whether
CPS investigated the family before, is sometimes released.
If you have a critically injured child or the child died of abuse had siblings
in your coverage area, do the following:
1. Find out if CPS is going to file an affidavit or appear before a juvenile court
judge that day to prove to a court that the child or the siblings need to be
taken into state custody.
2. Head to that court, attend the hearing and/or view the affidavit.

CPS Affidavits
CPS caseworkers who suspect a child has been abused to the point the
child should be removed from the home file an affidavit in juvenile court. It details
for the judge why the child should be taken into state custody.
Once that affidavit hits the court, it is presumed open unless a judge
decides otherwise. Some courts will not let you photocopy it but you can read it.
Read it into a tape recorder, it’s faster than writing it all out in longhand. Or type it
into a laptop.
Typically, CPS staffers will not give you the affidavit and tell you to go to
the court.
Find out who is the Texas Department of Child Protective Services
spokesperson in your area today. Take them to lunch. Get their cell phone. Learn
from them how CPS works before you have to deal with an abused child case
and/or death. Here’s a link to the CPS public information people in your area:

individual sign a waiver, found at this website:

Take a few tips from Tela Mange, DPS spokeswoman. Always try contacting
DPS officials early in the day. Be specific. Follow up by paying your bill promptly.
They can also check for commercial motor vehicle incident reports. Call them
early, be specific what you want and they’ll get it to you.

Commercial Motor Vehicles
DPS Motor Carrier Inspections
Commercial vehicles are subject to random checks by troopers. Every time a
commercial vehicle is stopped to be inspected by a DPS trooper, there is a report
of what they found. These motor carrier inspection reports are gold. If you have
an accident involving a motor carrier, you want to ask DPS for the any
inspections involving that motor carrier for the past three years.
Incident Reports
Have a major crash involving a truck or a bus in your area? Within a month of the
crash you should be able to get a copy of the DPS accident report from
DPS, 512.424.2080. The cost can vary. This will give you a likely cause of the

crash, but it will also give you a handy little list of the passengers, possible phone
numbers for them.
Crash Records at TxDOT
After that, you’ll need to go to the Texas Department of Transportation, the
custodian of all crash records. From TXDOT you can get information on trucking
companies and the verification of a company’s insurance. Start with the TxDOT
media office at 512.305.9196. Or you can try your hand at their website, at
www.txdot.gov and click on the heading “Motor Carrier” under the Business
section.
