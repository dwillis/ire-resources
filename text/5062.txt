How to collaborate when no
one understands what you do

The Data Journalist will collaborate with reporters across the newsroom on a range
of data-focused stories, from quick-hit pieces to long-term enterprise and
investigations. You must be able to do some writing, but your main focus will be on
enriching our journalism through data reporting and analysis.
You will be expected to generate story ideas and projects, but always with an eye
toward collaboration across one of more desks. You will work closely with
investigations, the news desk, graphics, the interactive team, the Data Blog and
data specialists elsewhere in the newsroom in order to identify opportunities at the
earliest possible stage.
Because the Data Projects team is meant to be a force multiplier in the newsroom,
you must be aggressively collaborative. The ultimate goal is not just individual
projects, but making stories that rely on (or should rely on) data better and data
journalism itself less the purview of a handful of specialists. Success means better,
deeper, richer stories, and also a newsroom more willing to embrace the idea of
data journalism generally and journalists who have the tools and training to work
with data directly.
