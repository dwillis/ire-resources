CHARTING THE COURSE FOR USE OF SMALL UNMANNED
AERIAL SYSTEMS IN NEWSGATHERING

Photographers Association (NPPA), 1100 M&T Center, 3 Fountain Plaza,

News organizations and individual journalists eagerly anticipate safely utilizing
Small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS) for newsgathering purposes as
lawmakers integrate sUAS into the National Air Space (NAS). For now these
potential users may be flying over an “unchartered” regulatory landscape while
the FAA struggles to complete its administrative rulemaking.
In order to better understand how media organizations and individual journalists
intend to use sUAS for newsgathering purposes; the National Press
Photographers Association (NPPA) developed a survey consisting of twentyone (21) multiple choice questions, with space for elaboration and three (3)
questions seeking a narrative responses.
The survey was distributed via email to approximately fifty (50) news
organizations and media associations. There were 680 responses, mostly from
those identifying themselves as “journalists,” with the next largest group being
news managers. Others responding to the survey include: attorneys,
academicians and students. The survey began on February 3, 2014 and remained
open until March 13, 2014. The survey answers provide a first-of-its-kind study
of this subject.
This paper introduces the reader to a brief history of manned flight and
photography, leading in the natural progression of the two technologies, to
sUAS use for newsgathering. The paper explores the ups and downs of current
and proposed FAA policies and regulations regarding sUAS use. Other issues
addressed include: state legislation as well as some recent incidents and cases
involving sUAS. Also examined are some of the proposed requirements found
in the FAA’s UAS Comprehensive Plan and the FAA Roadmap for Integration
of Civil UAS in the NAS.
Past privacy debates may be prologue to the present discussion when pondering
new rules and legislation. The historical debates between privacy concerns on
the one hand and newsgatherers’ use of emerging technologies on the other are
also examined.
The paper also explores how journalists may better understand and participate in
the rulemaking process as well as proposals for striking an appropriate and
acceptable balance between First Amendment protected newsgathering activities
and privacy concerns.

INTRODUCTION
In 1783 an untethered hot-air balloon rose into the skies over Paris carrying two passengers in
the first successful manned flight.1 Another invention took a little longer to develop when in 1826
the first permanent photograph was taken in France.2 More than 30 years later the two
technologies came together in the world’s first known aerial photograph, also shot over France in
1858 from a tethered hot-air balloon.3 Given the state of the art at that time, the enterprising
photographer also required a complete darkroom be taken aloft in the basket of the balloon to
accomplish that feat.4 Since then citizens and journalists have used all sorts of devices in order to
capture a birds-eye-view of the ground below.
Two years later James Black, an aspiring photographer, accomplished a similar achievement
over Boston when he took to the air in Samuel King’s hot-air balloon the “Queen of the Air” to
capture the first aerial photographs made in America.5
A Harvard professor by the name of Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. wrote about the photo in the
1863 edition of the Atlantic Monthly, proclaiming, “Boston, as the eagle and wild goose see it
[later to become the title of the photo], is a very different object from the same place as the solid
citizen looks up at its eaves and chimneys. As a first attempt it is on the whole a remarkable
success; but its greatest interest is in showing what we may hope to see accomplished in the same
direction.”6
That “direction” has far exceeded what anyone could have envisioned. Aerial vehicles as well
as photographic technology have experienced nothing short of a revolution. What has not changed
is man’s desire to see the world below from above. With the confluence of flight and photography
the law was relegated the Sisyphean task of trying to keep pace with technological advancements
and evolving standards of privacy.
Misgivings by the public over new technology are nothing new. Camera-equipped Small
(weighing less than 55 pounds) Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS) may well be considered the
great prodigy of the Kodak Brownie, which in 1888 spawned its own form of public hysteria. For
the first time in recorded history this camera’s portability and flexible film (celluloid) with greater
sensitivity to light allowed anyone to take photographs in public places rather than requiring the
controlled seclusion and long exposures previously only found in a photography studio. The
sudden appearance and widespread use of the Brownie caused the public to react with fear. Many
places posted signs banning the use of cameras, and newspapers ran stories about the dangers of
public photography.7

Adverse reaction to these new devices caught the attention of Louis D. Brandeis and Samuel
D. Warren, who expressed the fear that the “sensationalistic press” would use this new-fangled
device to wreak havoc on the “Right to Privacy” (the title of their 1890 Harvard Law Review
article).8 Their paper helped advance an “invasion of privacy” doctrine, which they explained as
occurring when “political, social, and economic changes entail the recognition of new rights, and
the common law, in its eternal youth, grows to meet the demands of society.”9 This became the
foundation of modern-day privacy tort law.
In what could be construed as a prophetic comment on today’s sUAS debate Brandeis and
Warren recognized “that modern devices afford abundant opportunities for the perpetration of
such wrongs without any participation by the injured party, the protection granted by the law must
be placed upon a broader foundation.”10 Similarly they inquired “whether the existing law affords
a principle which can properly be invoked to protect the privacy of the individual; and, if it does,
what the nature and extent of such protection is [?]”11
Flash forward 120 years to find the same public and government apprehension over the
exponential proliferation of sUAS-borne cameras. President Obama signed H.R. 658 titled: FAA
Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (FMRA)12 into law requiring the Transportation Secretary
to develop a plan to safely accelerate the integration of civil UAS into the National Airspace
System (NAS) by September 30, 2015. The bill was expected to expedite the development and
use of sUAS for use by news media as well as individual photographers.
Unfortunately, that has not been the case. Not only has the FAA been delayed in its rulemaking
timetable, it has chosen to enforce its stated policy prohibiting the use of sUAS for any
commercial purposes, which the FAA has determined includes newsgathering.
In light of recent incidents involving the use of sUAS and legal challenges to attempted FAA
enforcement, the National Press Photographers Association (NPPA) launched a first-of-its-kind
survey designed to gather information about the “Use of Remotely Controlled Aircraft or Drones
in Newsgathering.”13
This paper presents data in the form of anecdotal evidence from that survey in an effort to
provide a more informed discussion of how such sUAS use may be safely accomplished while
also addressing privacy concerns. The resulting analysis also provides a glimpse of the attitudes of
680 respondents regarding the use of sUAS for newsgathering purposes.
THE EVOLVING NATURE OF TECHNOLOGY
The self-evident nature of compelling news photos and video can be seen in the Pulitzer-Prize and
Emmy-Award winning images published and broadcast every year. Photographers using both
mediums strive to tell stories that inform and sometimes even bring about social change. The
technology has steadily evolved from Matthew Brady’s cumbersome camera equipment and horsewagon-drawn darkroom which provided the first visual coverage of the Civil War to the small and
sophisticated digital cameras employed to provide live high definition images from almost anywhere
in the world.

Images shot from sUAS are but the natural progression of aerial flight and photography. Just as
James Black provided a unique and never-seen-before view of Boston (although the city had been in
existence for 230 years14) so too have others yearned to capture images from a higher perspective.
Aerial photography was experimented with and accomplished using many devices. The overall
devastation in the aftermath of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire was shot by a resourceful
photographer using 17 kites to lift his specially designed, but very heavy camera 2,000 feet over the
city.15 Other more well-known inventors also brought their creative talents to bear on advancing this
expanding world view. Although better known for the Nobel Prize, Swedish inventor, Alfred Nobel
made the first successful aerial photograph from a rocket-mounted camera in 1897.16 And in 1909
Wilbur Wright flew the airplane from which the first aerial photograph was taken.17
With the advent of smaller and more advanced aerial platforms which are simple to operate and
inexpensive to purchase, it is logical that innovative visual journalists seek to report the news by using
these devices to capture images with which to better inform the public.
As of this writing, the FAA ban on the commercial use of drones in the U.S. remains the subject of
an administrative appeal after a judge found that the agency had violated procedural rules in enforcing
it. But the ban has not stopped some photographers and news organizations throughout the world
from experimenting with the capabilities of these devices. Here in the U.S., after a catastrophic
building explosion in New York City an sUAS was seen flying over the still burning rubble. Aerial
photos from that flight appeared in the New York Daily News and other publications.18 Less than a
week later, video shot from another sUAVs augmented footage of a roaring blaze in Brooklyn.19
Those images were broadcast around the country.
Internationally, sUAS have been used for a variety of journalistic purposes. For example, during
the recent unrest in the Ukraine an sUAS recorded aerial views of clashes between police and
demonstrators even as authorities tried to interfere with its operation using a laser beam.20 Other
countries have permitted use of sUAS for newsgathering as well.21
sUAS and the FAA
After an investigation of a 2011 sUAS flight over the University of Virginia’s Charlottesville
campus, the FAA levied a $10,000 fine against “Team BlackSheep”22 lead pilot Raphael “Trappy”
Pirker.23 The FAA alleged that the Pirker was paid for his flight over the school in violation of the
FAA’s 2007 ban on use of UAS for commercial purposes. The FAA enforcement action also claimed

that Pirker operated the 4.5 pound Styrofoam sUAS “in a careless or reckless manner so as to
endanger the life or property of another.”24
On September 27, 2013, Pirker’s attorney, Brendan Schulman, filed a motion to dismiss25 and on
March 6, 2014 an National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)26 administrative law judge granted
that motion by vacating and setting aside the FAA assessment (fine) and terminating the proceedings
against Pirker with prejudice (meaning they may not be refiled). In the eight page decision
Administrative Law Judge Patrick G. Geraghty wrote that none “of the definitions the FAA used for
‘aircraft’ are applicable to, or include a model aircraft within their respective definition” and Pirker
was “subject only to the FAA’s requested voluntary compliance” with rules for hobbyists. The judge
went further to say that the policy the FAA relied upon for its rules were “intended for internal
guidance” and “not a jurisdictional basis for asserting . . . enforcement authority on model aircraft
operations.”27 The court also found that the FAA “policy” was either non-binding or an invalid
attempt at legislative rulemaking by the FAA.28
Many welcomed that decision as a green light for wider use of sUAS, but less than a day later the
FAA filed an appeal which immediately stayed the court’s decision29 and also left enforcement of the
FAA ban on commercial use of sUAS up-in-the-air.
There has also been pushback from other sUAS operators. In February, Pedro Rivera, a
photojournalist for WFSB, a Hartford Connecticut TV station filed a federal lawsuit against police
alleging violations of his civil rights.30 According to reports, on his day off from work, Rivera flew
his sUAS over the scene of a fatal accident. Police ordered him to cease operating the device and
leave the scene. They also contacted his employer claiming he had interfered with their investigation
resulting in Rivera’s suspension for at least one week without pay. Rivera claimed he “did not take
aerial video for compensation by WFSB” but acknowledged “passing on drone-gathered video to the
commercial television station.”31
In March the Texas EquuSearch Mounted Search and Recovery, RPSearch Services Inc. and Mr.
Eugene Robinson challenged32 the wording in an FAA letter, which directed them to cease all use of
radio-control model aircraft used in its life-saving volunteer search-and-rescue efforts. The FAA
official had decreed in no uncertain terms that such operations are “illegal” and demanded that the
Texas EquuSearch Team “stop immediately.”
In response to what it deemed “misconceptions and misinformation” regarding sUAS regulations
the FAA posted an update on its official website meant to bust “Myths about the FAA and

Unmanned Aircraft.”33 But many still question whether the FAA has the authority to turn what
appear to be voluntary policies into mandatory compliance.34
FAA: POLICY VS. REGULATION
Last November the FAA produced three documents35 which when read together were to provide a
“roadmap” and expected timetable regarding possible future regulations of sUAS. The revised Notice
of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) for sUAS which was “expected to be released in early 2014”36 has
once again been delayed until November 2014 at the earliest.37
Regardless of when that notice is issued there is still much speculation as to what it may contain.
A belief exists that in spite of requests from the sUAS community calling for expedited and
commonsense regulations, providing operational guidance and regulatory certainty, the regulations
finally proposed by the FAA may actually be arbitrary and overly burdensome. Some have expressed
concerns that in its quest to ensure safety the FAA may just “copy and paste” its existing regulations
requiring “pilot and crew certification,” which could also include meeting medical, training and
security/vetting requirements as well as passing written and physical exams.38
Because breaking news stories are inherently unpredictable, language contained in the FAA
Roadmap regarding operation of sUAS in “approved airspace” and under specified “procedures”39 is
seen by some as a cause for concern. Proposals in its Comprehensive Plan restricting initial sUAS
flights to “daytime”40 operations “not over populated areas”41 create further apprehension on the part
of those wishing to use these devices for newsgathering. There is also fear that vague and undefined
references to “performance constraints” and “approved procedures” may also lead to arbitrary and
capricious operational restrictions upon sUAS operations.
Requiring that any sUAS be operated within the “visual line-of-sight (LOS) of the flight crew”42
or be subject to other compulsory procedures such as filing a flight plan and using a transponder may
also be problematic, by putting regulatory compliance beyond the means of most sUAS operators.
There is also unease about possible requirements for vehicle registration and regulations regarding the
recording and reporting of safety data.
Along with any safety rules is the issue of privacy. As part of an Explanatory Statement to the
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 201443 Congress directed the FAA “to conduct a study on the

implications of UAS integration into national airspace on individual privacy”44 within a year and
“address the application of existing privacy law to UAS integration; identify gaps in existing law,
especially with regard to the use and retention of personally identifiable information and imagery; and
recommend next steps for how the FAA can address the impact of widespread use of UAS on
individual privacy . . . .”45 The Act also mandates such report “be completed well in advance of the
FAA’s schedule for developing final regulations on the integration of UAS into the national
airspace.”46
STATE PRIVACY CONCERNS
Virginia became the first state to regulate UAS use in April 2013 followed closely by Idaho,
Florida and Texas. In the past year a total of 44 states have proposed or enacted similar measures. As
of this writing, bills are also being considered in Washington, Georgia, Iowa, Oregon, Pennsylvania
and Maryland that would directly impact if or how sUAS could be used for newsgathering.47 For the
most part, such legislative measures appear to address concerns regarding UAS operation by law
enforcement but some also seek to either criminalize or provide civil penalties for photographing a
person in a location “where they would have a reasonable expectation of privacy” or to photograph
private property without prior consent of the property owner.
For example Texas law48 makes it a misdemeanor to capture images of a person or private
property using an unmanned aircraft flying higher than eight feet in the air without permission of the
person or property owner. It also provides civil penalties for “disclosure, display, distribution, or other
use of any images captured” in violation of the law. There are 19 exceptions under which such use is
permitted.49 Newsgathering, expressly included in the proposed legislation was struck as an exception
in the amended final bill.
THE SURVEY
In order to better understand how media organizations and individual journalists intend to use
sUAS for newsgathering purposes; the NPPA developed a survey (the Survey) consisting of twentyone (21) multiple choice questions, with space for elaboration and three (3) questions seeking a
narrative responses.
A hyperlink to the survey was distributed via email to approximately fifty (50) news organizations
and media associations. The survey was also promoted on the NPPA website as well as on the NPPA
Facebook page and through other social media such as Twitter to members and employees of those
groups. There were 680 responses during the survey period which began on February 3, 2014 and
remained open until March 13, 2014. Questions included professional experience, job classification
and market size.
Methodology
The Survey is far from purely scientific. The responses are valuable, but the dataset has limitations.
Questions were formulated to gauge initial interest and experience with sUAS along with first
impressions of early adopters. Although there were a statistically valid number of responses those
answers should not be inferred to the industry at large; but while respondents were self-selected their
anecdotal answers are very instructive.

Respondents working for newspapers of all sizes including non-daily and online publications
accounted for almost 38 percent of those responding. The next largest group at 21 percent considered
themselves to be independent journalists, while slightly more than 20 percent work in various market
size TV stations. Of the 15.4 percent who chose “other” most considered themselves to be
photographers, journalists, students or educators.
It is useful to note that 434 of respondents stated they worked outside the TV industry which has
traditionally been the only sub-sector that could afford helicopters. The non-TV cohorts’ interest in
sUAS simultaneously suggests that the competitive advantage of some larger broadcasters may be
challenged as small communities, located far from those cosmopolitan TV markets, benefit from
increased reporting capabilities provided by sUAS.

sUAS Operational Skill
It appears that when comparing answers to Question 5 regarding skill in using an sUAS for aerial
photography or videography with those in Question 19 about FAA restrictions: those with higher
levels of skill were also the most concerned about the FAA limiting their use. Of respondents who
were most unskilled, 39 percent expressed the concern about FAA limits on journalistic use of sUAS,
while 44 percent of those with some skill felt that way. Half of respondents who were somewhat
confident in their abilities had a 56 percent concern rate, whereas 69 percent of those most confident
in their skill level were most concerned about FAA restrictions.

described those uses. Seventy-two percent used sUAS to capture moving images while 55.9 percent
stated they used them to take still images. Twenty-nine percent claimed to have used sUAS on
breaking news stories versus 54.7 percent for non-breaking news. Respondents were divided almost
evenly as to whether or not such sUAS use for newsgathering captured images that included people.
In the “other” category 21 respondents specified such things as acquiring third party video and
inclusion of people in images only from a distance so as to make them personally unidentifiable.

Reasons for Not Using sUAS for Newsgathering
Of the 470 respondents who answered question 9 by indicating they had never used sUAS for
newsgathering purposes, 394 answered question 14 by providing a number of reasons for their
decision. Fifty-one percent considered such use but were concerned about violating state or federal
regulations; 35 percent were concerned about the expense; approximately 24 percent were evenly
divided between safety and insurance liability concerns; 20 percent were concerned about damaging
or losing equipment; 16 percent had considered the matter but did not do so because there was no
corporate policy on sUAS use; 15 percent never considered using an sUAS because they believed it
would not help tell news stories in their market; as compared with almost 8 percent who did consider
such use but could not see a journalistic justification for it. There were 89 comments regarding legal
or financial concerns and cost/benefit evaluations.

sUAS Use for Newsgathering (continued)
Question 16 asked about the potential and anticipated applications in using sUAS in
newsgathering. The 302 individual responses were very similar to those in answer to question 12.
Many wrote it was a better way to cover major news events such as accidents, fires, natural disasters,
and sports. Some referenced access to difficult terrain combined with the ability to provide overall
views and unique perspectives not normally seen. Others cited cost compared to a helicopter as well
as the safety factor in using and unmanned aircraft. One saying, “For my helo costs, I could probably
have a dozen HD live capable drones in the air.” Another respondent said “the cost of using a
helicopter or fixed wing aircraft is high, anywhere from $400 to $1,800 per hour. A drone, such as the
DJI Phantom, costs less than $23.00 per hour, making aerial news photography cost effective for
daily use.” Some other direct quotes include:
•

“Drone aircraft could have given us better perspective on a story we are covering right now:
Ice jams in a river and the threat of flooding. We cannot safely get closeups of the problem
with a news crew. A drone could fly, give us a better angle and safer.”

•

“Major news events where access is limited and roadblocks prevent us from getting close
enough to get the shots needed. Our competitors have helicopters and are doing this
everyday. Although they are paying an expense my company won't cover.”

When asked about whether respondents were being prevented from telling stories because of a
lack of aerial coverage, 70 percent of the 424 who answered wrote no. Of the 29 percent who
indicated they were being prevented, 110 of them supplied explanations ranging from access
restrictions by law enforcement to loss of the ability to convey the size of events with large crowds.
Once again disaster coverage such as ice jam flooding was a recurring theme as was wildfires. There
were many references to the fact that all stories could be improved with some sort of aerial coverage.
Acquiring video appears to be the main objective along with still images. Potential stories tend to
be about landscapes and environmental concerns, showing previously unavailable vantage points and
overall images of large areas and structures. A number of respondents (those who had previously
used sUAS, as well as those who had not because of current FAA policies) also wished to document
crowd events using sUAS.

14

A number of respondents indicated a preference for sUAS use to navigate around obstructions;
either for reasons of personal safety, police restrictions or hazardous environments. A few vivid
examples:
•

“Recently we had authorities burn down a house filled with explosives. A drone would have
helped us get images of action going on at the scene and the fire itself.”

•

“We did a video about the 5th anniversary of the closure of a GM plant. It would have been
nice to go on an adjoining property and do a fly by to see the sprawling facility at more than
eye level. Instead, we just drove by the fence and shot video.”

Privacy Concerns
In response to concerns about the media’s use of sUAS having the potential to invade someone’s
privacy, there were 506 individually written narratives. Many stated it was no different than situations
involving manned aircraft or use of telephoto lenses on the ground. Some believe that current privacy
laws and professional ethical standards more than adequately address the issue while others think that
updated laws may be needed.
When assessing privacy concerns with sUAS use, the answers were diverse. One respondent
wrote, “The media has legally, ethically and respectfully used wireless microphones, tiny cameras
and super-telephoto cameras without invasions of privacy for decades. It is not in the interest of
legitimate news organizations to alienate our audience by invading, or being perceived to invade,
privacy. We will conduct ourselves with the same level of professional integrity with drones.”
Another believed, “you have no reasonable expectation of privacy when out in the open or in a public
place.”
Two responses articulated risks to safety associated with sUAS operating in a competitive
environment:
•

“There is a safety aspect. Police helicopters fly between 400-600 feet; media fly between
700-900 feet. I don't trust that person flying a drone not to interfere with a manned aircraft.
Today, we waited to the last minute to cancel a live shot due to lightning. We could see the
storm on radar, but the reporter didn’t want to disappoint the producer and kill the live shot. I
finally did. Safety first. By the way, I was a flight medic in the army, and now operate a Flir
gyro-cam in our helicopter. I have over 2000 flight hours.

•

I think drone use in a newsroom should be strictly regulated much like satellite truck
operations. Only one or two people in the newsroom should be authorized to fly a drone and
I think the drone and the operators need to be licensed.”

FAA Concerns vs Job Titles
Analyzing some of the answers, 45 percent of the 576 respondents were most concerned that the
FAA would restrict journalists’ abilities to use sUAS. But that concern is not uniformly felt.
Independent journalists and “others” were at 50 percent or more on the most concerned scale.
Students had the least concern regarding the FAA followed by staff journalists, at 40 percent.
Attorneys were less concerned than senior managers who were less concerned than middle managers.

FAA Regulations
The responses to Question 19 regarding concerns over FAA regulations are interesting when
compared with answers to Question 20 of how likely respondents are to comply with those
regulations. Only 43 percent of attorneys were concerned the FAA would restrict journalists, and 71
percent -- the highest percentage -- said they would comply. On the flip side, Independent journalists,
who may lack the backing of a major organization, were most concerned about FAA regulations, but
were least likely to say they would absolutely comply (Half said they were most concerned, 41
percent said they would definitely comply with regulations). Also ranking low on the list of expected
compliance: staff journalists.

First Amendment Protection
Eighty-six percent of respondents believe journalists have a First Amendment right to use sUAS,
but only 30 percent of them think that right is absolute. Thirty-six percent of senior managers think
that right is absolute, while only 23 percent of their middle managers think that way. Six of the seven
attorneys who answered believe there is a limited First Amendment right.
Respondents’ attitudes towards regulations were on-the-whole quite fearful, but more of that is
directed towards federal regulators than the states. The vast majority expects that the FAA will restrict
journalists’ use of sUAS. Surprisingly the expectation that states will restrict journalistic sUAS use
was more balanced; only a small majority anticipated problems.
It should be once again noted that that these findings are not predictive of the industry as a whole
but rather what this self-selected group believes.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Increasing attempts by states to prohibit sUAS use compounded by delayed FAA rulemaking
underscore the need for comprehensive and commonsense regulations that will strike an equitable
balance between privacy; air safety concerns; and the constitutional rights of citizens and journalists
to use these devices for newsgathering. FAA enforcement threats and demands to “cease and desist”
operational activities pursuant to its 2007 “policies” regarding commercial use of sUAS and the 1981
Advisory Circular for Model Aircraft, both mischaracterized as requiring “mandatory” compliance do
nothing to further a constructive discussion of the issues and will only produce more litigation and
confusion.
In any field there will always be bad actors. In any human endeavor there will always be
accidents. Neither of these should be used as a pretext to ban any commercial uses of these
evolving technologies. NPPA has a strict code of ethics promoting “the highest standards in
visual journalism.”50 The Professional Society of Drone Journalists (PSDJ) also has also
formulated an ethical code for journalists using sUAS. Its elements are newsworthiness; safety;
sanctity of law and public spaces; privacy; and traditional journalism ethics.51 The principles
contained in these codes should also be considered when formulating the rules regulating sUAS use
in newsgathering.
Additionally, some sUAS organizations have proven that community-based safety codes
such as the one created by the Academy of Model Aeronautics (AMA)52 are effective in selfregulating operations. The AMA also lists a number of liability and accident insurance plans that
could satisfy basic indemnification prerequisites. The consensus is that those using sUAS for
newsgathering will be expected to obtain some level of certification and the same amount of liability
coverage as commercial and recreational UAS operators.
A potential solution to future FAA requirements was recently announced by one company
producing a popular sUAS. DJI is now offering updated software and automatic safety controls that
will prevent the vehicle from flying into restricted airspace, like an airport and allow preset height and
distance limitations to keep comply with possible restrictions.53
But promulgating reasonable regulations for the use of sUAS for newsgathering is the key.
Requiring proof of flight proficiency, a vehicle registration scheme and minimum insurance,
similar to motor vehicle operation make sense. A pilot certification course for sUAS that is far
more costly than the devices themselves, along with burdensome reporting processes and
onerous requirements for filing flight plans are counter-intuitive and will be counterproductive.
As signatory to a joint letter to FAA Administrator Michael Huerta, the NPPA agrees that
the delayed Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for sUAS continues a regulatory void which “has

left American entrepreneurs, journalists and others either sitting on the sidelines or operating in
the absence of appropriate safety guidelines.”54
Therefore, the FAA should consider incorporating sUAS regulations (including for editorial use)
already adopted in Canada and Australia as a means of implementing expedited U.S. rules with full
input from media representatives. The reality is that sUAS use for newsgathering is occurring on
a daily basis and the longer sUAS integration into the US National Airspace is delayed, the
farther behind we become globally.
It is incumbent that the FAA chart a pragmatic and expedited course in its administrative
rulemaking. There is neither room nor time for complacency or hubris in addressing this matter, lest,
flying too low or too high it end up failing like Icarus55 in an attempt to rule the sky.
CONCLUSION
Results of the Study show that many people and organizations in the journalism community and
elsewhere wish to use sUAS for newsgathering, but are afraid to do so for a number of reasons,
especially fear of regulatory, tort and in some cases criminal liability.
Society relies upon laws and regulations to provide certainty about what actions are and are not
permissible. While the law has historically played catch-up with technology, the exponential rate of
such advancements when compared to the tortuous administrative rulemaking process only
exacerbates that gap.
The advent of the first handheld camera created concerns regarding the right to privacy. Those
early fears were properly addressed through legislation and caselaw, where the laws regarding
invasion of privacy, trespass, harassment and stalking are now well-settled.
With the proliferation of cellphone cameras and the ease with which images of all types (still &
video) may be disseminated many legislatures have attempted to criminalize traditionally protected
First Amendment activities with new laws. Despite the fact that most privacy concerns are already
allayed by common law tort principles, those constitutionally suspect measures continue to be
proposed and adopted in an attempt to “shoot the messenger” by prohibiting the use of sUAS for
various purposes including newsgathering.
It will be important to see how the full NTSB will rule in Pirker given its mission to independently
advance transportation safety56 and how the FAA reacts to a potentially unfavorable ruling. Also on
the horizon will be increased legal challenges to state laws prohibiting use of sUAS, especially where
the prohibitions are unconstitutional because they are not content neutral, overly broad and vague; and
in the case of newsgathering, limit more speech than is necessary to achieve a significant
governmental purpose. Restrictions on this type of Electronic News Gathering (ENG) might also be
susceptible to challenge as an unconstitutional prior restraint.
The question of federal preemption also must be considered in relation to the patchwork of current
and future state legislation. While the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 does not contain
an express preemption clause, the courts have held in certain instances that FAA regulations preempt
state air safety and aviation noise rules;57 but in other cases, such as between property owners, the

FAA does not possess adjudicatory power.58 Of course none of this can even begin to be decided until
the FAA files it notice of proposed rulemaking.
As was written of the 1860 Boston aerial photo – “its greatest interest is in showing what
we may hope to see accomplished in the same direction” – must one wonder when the
expressed desire for legally approved sUAS use will come to fruition? In the meantime the
concern is not so much when the FAA will be able to promulgate new rules regarding sUAS
operation but whether those regulations will be so outmoded and burdensome as to cause their
widespread disregard, resulting in a situation that is no better than it is today.
