State Attorney General
If there’s a business, there’s probably a complaint. Depending on your state, you can probably find records on auto repair
companies, propane dealers, chain letters, campgrounds, pet breeders, dating services, employment scams, hospital billing,
instructors and classes, airlines and charities, just to name a few.
Better Business Bureau
Use the BBB as a first stop to determine whether there might be a story. BBBs vary from region to region, but oftentimes can
provide complaints faster than your AG. Some may reach out on your behalf to find unhappy consumers so you can personalize
your story. But some BBBs have come under fire for their rankings, so we suggest always finding additional sources for complaints.
Local Offices of Consumer Protection
Similar to a state AG, these offices are often the most proactive agency and will have the best records on local scams and con artists.
Local Health Department
You can find complaints and inspections for restaurants, tattoo parlors, school bathrooms, workplaces, hospitals and any other
“public health” location.
Professional licensing boards
In Maryland alone they license (and keep complaints on) doctors, nurses, chiropractors, funeral homes, athlete agents, barbers,
cosmetologists, architects, interior designers, landscape architects, engineers, land surveyors, foresters, HVAC contractors, tax
preparers, locksmiths, master electricians, pilots, plumbers, accountants, real estate agents and appraisers, home inspectors
pawnbrokers and precious metal dealers.
State and local departments of education
You can get complaints on everything involving schools, including the food, the state of the buildings, playgrounds and violations of
student IEPs.
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and other transportation agencies
If it moves, there’s probably a list of complaints about it. For instance, in Washington, DC we found our METRO system keeps
complaints on everything from robberies to faulty intercom systems to emergency buttons.
Federal Trade Commission’s Consumer Sentinel www.ftc.gov/enforcement/consumer-sentinel-network
You can also FOIA complaints on a specific company or type of industry.
Franchise Disclosure Documents
If it’s a franchise, some states require the parent company to file this lengthy document detailing potential problems, lawsuits and
regulatory actions.
SEC EDGAR filings http://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html
The 10-K will often contain lawsuits and regulatory actions against a company based on consumer complaints.
Federal and state environmental agencies
Local taxi commissions
OSHA and state occupational safety and health offices
U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission www.cpsc.gov/en/Research--Statistics/
State utility regulators
