What the Hell is D3? And all the other questions you’re afraid to ask
Finding the sessions behind the terms
Jaimi Dowdell, IRE/NICAR

Now that Sisi Wei and Tisha Thompson have uncovered the mysteries of the many different
terms and software you might encounter at the conference, here’s how you can find sessions to
learn about those things.
Get the app.
The best way to find sessions that interest you is to use the conference mobile app.
Go here https://guidebook.com/g/CAR16/ to get a link texted to your phone.

Once you get the app, open it and find the CAR 2016 guide. In the first screen, click on the
menu icon in the upper left-hand corner:

You’ll then see a screen with a search icon (see below). Click it and type in whatever topic or
class you’re looking for.

For example, say you want to find sessions involving D3. Type D3 in the search bar and the
Guidebook app will search all session descriptions for matches. You can then click on sessions
for more details and add them to your personal schedule.

Most search terms will pull up sessions, but since a search for “R” will find any session with an
“R” in the description we thought it’d help to give you a list. Below you can find all of the handson classes that teach or work with R.
Don’t hesitate to contact any IRE staff member with questions about conference sessions or the
app. You can also email IREhelp@ire.org.
