Specifics:
1) Learn how an institution is structured and financed. See if they
file 990 returns through GuideStar, file any forms with the
Foundation Center, or if the Chronicle of Philanthropy has included
the group in its surveys. The Smithsonian is financed through the
government, private endowment and gifts.
2) Who gives to this institution? Information through annual reports,
gift agreements, contracts, the Foundation Center and philanthropy
groups, Grantmakers In the Arts, and newer givers, such as Target
and Home Depot.
3) Check whether this giving is acceptable to watchdog groups.
Commercial Alert follows the Smithsonian to see if they are selling
off too much of the Smithsonian name.
Carl Malamud at Media.Org follows the Smithsonian.
4) Use the FOIA power. If the institution is exempt, try the local
District Attorney or any local group that handles consumer
complaints.
5) Go to every open meeting of the governing body and the advisory
groups. Keep a list of every board member and all speakers.
6) Get on the alert e-mail for every investigative agency. The local
Better Business Bureau, the public ombudsman, the local unions
7) Find people and ask them for e-mails, reports.
