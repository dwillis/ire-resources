Information Act (FOIA)
and YOU!

The Federal Freedom of
Information Act
• 5 U.S.C. § 552
• Provides a right of access to existing “records”
held by federal executive branch “agencies”
(for the most part)
• Does not apply to legislative or judicial
branches (Congress or the courts)

FOIA v. State Public Records Laws
• Every state and D.C. has adopted its own
public records law.
• These state laws can vary widely.
– Some provide access to judicial and
legislative records
– Different procedures
– There’s often less-developed case law
– Response times are almost* always shorter!

Making a FOIA Request
Submitting a FOIA request is easy (in theory).
Three requirements:
• Written request
• “Reasonably describe” the records sought
• Follow applicable agency regulations
Look at the agency regulations/website – you never
know what might be there!

What can you ask for?
• FOIA applies to “records” that already exist
– You cannot ask for the creation or compilation of
information

• This includes all types of documentary
information, such as papers, reports, letters, email, films, computer tapes, photographs and
sound recordings in any format, including
electronic
– You can ask for records in their original form

• Physical objects that cannot be reproduced are
not “records”

How should you ask for it?
• Your request must be specific enough so that a government
employee familiar with the subject area can locate the records
with reasonable effort
• Consider specifying places for the agency to search
– Both different information systems and physical locations
– For the FBI, for example: the main and cross-reference
indices of the Central Records System (“CRS”), the electronic
surveillance indices (“ELSUR”), the "Enterprise Vault"
system that archives e-mails older than 30 days (for some
DOJ components)

Expedited Processing
• FOIA authorizes agencies to use multitrack
processing

Expedited Processing
• 28 CFR § 16.5(e)(1): Expedited processing is granted at DOJ when the
request involves:
– (i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited processing could
reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or
physical safety of an individual;
– (ii) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal
Government activity, if made by a person who is primarily engaged in
disseminating information;
– (iii) The loss of substantial due process rights; or
– (iv) A matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which
there exist possible questions about the government's integrity that
affect public confidence.
• Under DOJ regulations, expedited processing can be requested at any time
• If you request expedited processing, you must include “a statement,
certified to be true and correct, explaining in detail the basis for making
the request for expedited processing.”

Fee Reductions and Waivers

Fees
• Agencies may charge “reasonable” fees for the
“direct” costs of searching for and copying the
records you request, unless you are entitled to
a fee benefit/reduction or waiver.
• It’s a good idea to include a statement in your
request of how much you are willing to pay,
and to ask the agency to contact you if fees
will exceed that amount before proceeding.

“Representative of the News Media”
• Fees are limited to standard charges for document duplication, 5
U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II), AND
– First 100 pages free, usually ~$0.05 - $0.15/page after that, or
the actual direct cost of the copy (e.g., if in electronic form)
• Who’s a “representative of the news media”?
• “[A]ny person or entity that gathers information of potential
interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn
the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work
to an audience.”
• Cause of Action v. FTC (2005): requester must (1) gather
information of potential interest (2) to a segment of the public;
(3) use its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct
work; and (4) distribute that work (5) to an audience.

“Public Interest” Fee Waiver
• “[I]f disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is
likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the
operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the
commercial interest of the requester.”
• Cause of Action v. FTC (2015)
– To qualify for a fee waiver, the requested information must: (1) shed
light on the operations or activities of the government; (2) be likely
to contribute significantly to public understanding of those
operations or activities; and (3) not be primarily in the commercial
interest of the requester.
– FOIA does not require a requester to reach a wide audience. The
standard “is whether the requester will disseminate the disclosed
records to a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the
subject.”

Submitting the Request
• Check the agency website!
• Some accept via email/electronic portal, some
by fax, some by snail mail
• If mailing/faxing, be sure to CLEARLY mark it
as a FOIA/PA request on the outside/cover
sheet

What to Expect
• Generally, the agency must make a “determination”
within 20 business days
– That includes: (i) gathering and reviewing the documents;
(ii) determining and communicating the scope of the
documents the agency intends to produce and withhold,
and the reasons for withholding any documents; and (iii)
informing the requester that it can appeal whatever
portion of the “determination” is adverse. CREW v. FEC,
711 F. 3d 180 (D.C. Cir. 2013)
– An agency can extend this time if “unusual circumstances”
apply, such as if voluminous records must be searched, if
records must be retrieved from various offices or if several
agencies must be consulted.

What to Expect
• The agency must make a determination
as to whether or not to grant a request
for expedited processing within 10
calendar days
• After that, they must process the
request “as soon as practicable”

Unfortunately, the statutory deadlines for FOIA
requests are rarely complied with

Following Up
• Agency acknowledgement
– NOT a determination

• Tracking number
• Agency’s Public Liaison/Chief FOIA Officer
– Consider negotiating/limiting request

• Office of Government Information Services
(OGIS)
