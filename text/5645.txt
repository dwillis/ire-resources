THINK LIKE AN ENTREPRENEUR
Pitch your project to editors and colleagues (in a memo or a presentation)
Sell not just the project but the outcomes. Talk about how it will:
Help the company’s image;
Inform the public;
Spur reform;
Generate traffic;
Spawn follow-up stories
SPREAD YOUR TENTACLES
Can you partner with other journalists?
Can you partner with photogs/ graphics?
Can you get other departments involved?
Don’t be afraid to reach outside your company: Reach out to IRE or the NICAR Listserv for
assistance; partner with nonprofit news groups that can help (ProPublica, Hechinger Report,
etc.)

THINK BIGGER
Your work/job isn’t any less important because of your newsroom size/market size.
Just because your newsroom is smaller, doesn’t mean your story can’t be one of state or
national consequence.
Don’t be confined by your coverage area: If something is happening in your community or
coverage area, ask yourself if it’s happening in other areas, too. Expand your investigation -- get
records and talk to sources throughout the state/nation.

TURN CONTENT
Keep contributing. As difficult and time consuming as investigating is, don’t use it as a reason to
hide under your desk. Help when you can, whether it be breaking news or following up on
something from a daily story. Also, suggest investigative ideas for co-workers or provide data
that can help other reporters working on daily stories.
BE EFFICIENT
Don’t waste time on stories that don’t matter as much. Get them done quickly and move on.
ASK FOR HELP
Ask for a research day or days. Make those days count. Not just from management and peers.
Go to your accounting department and ask the experts to give you a crash course on
Excel/Access (basic filtering, sorting and formulas).
DON’T GIVE TOO MUCH AWAY TO YOUR BOSS
Unless you know with certainty you have a great story on your hands or for legal/ethical reasons
you need to say something, don’t tell your boss what you’re working on. That buys you more
time to work on your big project.
LOOK FOR THE RIGHT FIT
Not everyone is meant to be an investigative reporter. Find the people in your newsroom with
the passion, skill set and experience to work on big projects, then give them the time, resources
and training they need.
DELIVER
Make the most of the time you’re given to turn big projects. Make a difference with your stories
and you’ll get even more time to turn even bigger stories in the future.
