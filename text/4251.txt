Today’s Agenda
• Where to find data and stats about your local
immigrant community
• Finding and reporting immigration stories
locally
• Covering immigration with sensitivity and tact
• A review of recent immigration reform efforts

Why Cover Immigration Issues?
• One of the biggest stories of our time,
nationally and internationally
• Present-day immigration exceeds Ellis Island
inflows of the 1900s
• Immigration reform efforts are a continuing
political, cultural and demographic story

Why Cover Immigration Issues?
• Immigration affects all aspects of civil society
– Education, health, economy, politics, culture, etc.

• Immigration affects every local community
(Urban, suburban, rural)

Acquiring Local Expertise
• Talk to all the local players
– Advocates, nonprofit organizations and
community centers, immigration lawyers,
immigrant-owned businesses

• Pound the pavement
– Visit local social services agencies, churches,
businesses, clinics, etc.

• How does local government deal with recent
immigrant populations?

Acquiring Local Expertise
• What are immigrants most concerned about?
• How do national policies affect your
immigrant community?

Cracking the Official Govt. Code
• Get to know your local ICE spokesperson/local
and federal enforcement officials
• Ask to accompany Border Patrol agents on
patrol/raids
• Visit the local ICE detention facility
• Talk to immigration judges/lawyers and attend
deportation/asylum hearings

Other Ways to Obtain Access
• Immigration sources that can unlock doors —
from Lise Olsen
– American Immigration Lawyers Assn members
– ACLU immigration/refugee resettlement offices
– Immigrants’ rights groups
– Chaplains, volunteers in immigration detention
– Federal agents
– Local police officers — especially those on federal task
forces

Polling Question
•How often does your
media organization
publish a local
immigration story?
– Several times a week
– Weekly
– Few times a month
– Rarely
– I can’t remember when
we last did one

Interviewing Vulnerable Populations
• Establish trust with your subject
• Minimize harm
– Will revealing a person’s name or other personal
details place him/her in jeopardy?
– Determine if a person’s legal status is pertinent to
your story

• Advocates or lawyers can help you gain access
to interview their clients

Preferred Terminology
• Undocumented Immigrants, undocumented
workers, etc. (used by borderzine.com and
other news outlets)
• NOT illegal immigrant or illegal aliens (banned
by AP and the NYT and others)
• Ask yourself: Is this person’s status pertinent
to my story.

community overall, including

reform bill in summer 2013
– Provides path to citizenship for undocumented
immigrants and special status for children brought
to the U.S. by undocumented parents

2014?

immigrant community

string during downtime

Covering Immigration

pieces that build toward the longer story

stories
• Be persistent and productive
