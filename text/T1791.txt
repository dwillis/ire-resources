When to use a program:
1) Repetitive tasks, such as importing numerous files with the same format either at one time or at
various points in time
2) Data manipulation, such as appending numerous files together or adding new fields
3) Mass data “updates.” Adding new fields and populating it with values (especially if you have a
series of fields or if you need to do the same updates on different data repeatedly). There is an easy
way to write this code using Excel.
4) Creating new tables en masse from one or more existing tables
5) Run a series of queries
Common commands:
Set directory to – establishes where your data files and work product are stored
Use -- either opens or closes a file
Select – used in conjunction with name of file or location of file (slot number)
Copy structure to – copies blank structure of a DBF file
Append from – append data to an existing DBF (if file you are appending from is not a DBF, need to
specify how it is delimited. See Fox help for assistance)
Alter table – indicates that you are going to make changes to the structure of a table
Add column – used in conjunction with alter table to add a new column
Replace all – used to populate a field with certain values
Close all – closes all open files
Adir -- sets up a temporary array
For…EndFor – Used with a loop to specify which actions should be done repeatedly on all files
identified in the temporary array
Loop – tells the program to loop back and repeat what it just did
Into Table – use in conjunction with a query to save the query results into a new table
PROGRAM 2:
close all
clear all
gcSourceDir = 'c:/xxxx/'
gcStrucDir = 'c:/xxxx/yyyy/'
set directory to (gcSourceDir)
=adir(temparray, "*.txt")
For a=1 to alen(temparray,1)
teamname = left(alltrim(temparray(a,1)),at(".",temparray(a,1))-1)
use (gcStrucDir) + 'struc1'
copy structure to (gcSourceDir) + (teamname)
use
use (teamname) in 2
select 2
append from (temparray(a,1)) delimited with blank

alter table (teamname) + '.dbf';
add column team c(50)
replace all team with (teamname)
loop
ENDFOR
close all
PROGRAM 3:
close all
clear all
gcSourceDir = 'c:/xxxx/'
gcStrucDir = 'c:/xxxx/yyyy/'
set directory to (gcSourceDir)
use (gcStrucDir) + 'struc2.dbf' in 0
copy structure to (gcSourceDir) + 'ALLMLB'
use
use 'allmlb' in 1
=adir(temparray2, "*.dbf")
For a=1 to alen(temparray2,1)
teamname2 = left(alltrim(temparray2(a,1)),at(".",temparray2(a,1))-1)
append from (temparray2(a,1))
loop
endfor
select team, count(*);
from allmlb;
group by 1;
order by 2 desc;
select team,date, att01, ytd01, avg01, att02, ytd02, avg02;
from allmlb;
order by team, date;
nowait;
into table 'finalmlb'
