Newspaper Archives
What if I don't have LexisNexis, Factiva, etc. Where can I search newspaper archives?
In most communities, you can access remotely some newspaper archives and other information databases
through your local public library. All you need is a library card. Also, check the Web sites of public
libraries in surrounding counties to see if they have different newspaper archives (such as New York
Times Historical or Chicago Tribune archive) available online. If so, do they have a reciprocal agreement
L
with your county?

Local colleges and universities may have different newspaper archive databases than the local public
library but unless you are a student there, you will need to visit the library to utilize these databases.
http://news.google.com Google News: While this is not a long-term archive, it does archive newspaper
and television articles from the past 30 days. This can be a good source for finding articles on recent
stories.

Google News alerts: Need to keep current on a topic or person?
Create a Google News Alert to receive alerts at a frequency of your choice: once a day, as it happens, or
once a week. After the alert is set up, confirm the alert via e-mail to activate it.

What to look for in newspaper archives
Search newspaper archives for obits, weddinglengagement announcements or divorces. Obits and
weddindengagement announcements will give you names of family members.
Real estates sales are often listed in newspapers. Newspaper archives might also have lists or stories
about lawsuits or business licenses/new business stories.
Perhaps there might be stories about the person of interest from a few years ago that could be about a
crime or tragedy or receiving an award or a promotion or just being quoted by attending a local event.
Also, the person's name might show up in a photo caption.
Need to find folks who went to high school with someone? Some newspaper archives contain lists of
high school graduates or honor rolls and most newspapers cover high school sports and other high school
activities. Search for the name of the high school (as an exact phrase) in the appropriate year range.
Getting too many hits? Add keywords such as student or students, coach, graduation, name of sport,
science fair, etc. And don't forget about the clip files!

person on the Web and you did not know the person's middle name, you could use this for your
search: "Firstname * Lastname" Of course, you will want to verify with a second source that the
information you find is about your person of interest, especially if it is a common name.
