Stats for stories: Some pluses and minuses that may divide
you from multiples of other journalists
Jennifer LaFleur, The Dallas Morning News
jlafleur@dallasnews.com

If you’ve been using computer-assisted
reporting, you likely have been using statistics.
Many of the things we do every time we use
databases is use statistics. It doesn’t mean you
have to use the Kriscrinkal's Ho Coefficient or the
Likkortobier Ratio. Here’s an outline of those tools,
from basic to more advanced.

Percent of total
This one is easy to get turned around. The rule
is: the amount divided by the total.
Percent change
When you're dealing with two years worth of
data and want to figure percent change from one
year to the next, take the difference of the two
values divided by the amount from the earlier
year.
Per capita and rates
Looking at occurrences by city or county or state
can be interesting. But remember to keep things
on common ground. I can't compare raw
numbers if the "bases" are different. That means
if I'm looking at the number of murders or the
number of home loans by city in the United
States, Los Angeles and New York probably will
come out on top, but only because they have
more people. A more useful measure would be
per capita murders. In this case, per capita
murders would be the number of murders
divided by population.
Sometimes these measures will be adjusted a
little if the number of occurrences is low. Crime
statistics, for example often are reported per
100,000 or per 10,000 people. These measures
are used because the number of murders in a city
is low compared to the number of people. If you

have multiple murders per person – you might
want to check the source of your data. When the
per capita measure might be 0.0005, the figure
per 100,000 people it becomes easier to read: 50
murders per 100,000 people.
Per-plexed? When you're trying to figure if
persons per household is households divided by
population or population divided by households,
do one simple thing: turn your per into a division
sign. This means that persons PER households
becomes persons / households or
population/households.
Mean, median and mode
Why do we often see things such as home values
and income reported as median rather than just
the average (mean)? That’s because the median
(the middle value – the point at which half the
values are above and half are below) isn’t
swayed by extremes like the average (total of
everything divided by the number) is. So one big
fancy house on a block will throw off the
average value for the neighborhood.
If you’re trying to decide which to use, test to see
whether there is a big difference between the
mean and the median. If there isn’t, use the
mean. It’s easier to explain to readers.
Why care about the mode? The mode (the most
frequently occurring value) can be important to
show clusters.
Make some adjustments
If you are dealing with money from year to year,
you need to know how to adjust for inflation. To
compute inflation, just look at the percent change
in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) from one year
to the next and adjust the previous years "up" to
reflect them in current dollars. Because CPI
varies regionally, use the CPI for your area.

Group 2 is more concentrated toward the
middle:

Exploring your data
When you go beyond calculations and want to
start studying your data, here are some things to
look at:
Range
By examining the range of your data – the highs
and the lows -- you’ll find extremes. This can
help you show part of the story about your data.
We report on ranges a lot. A good example is
with census data where we report the “richest”
census tract or the “oldest city.”
Distribution
The range gives you part of the picture, but how
the rest of the data is distributed can make a big
difference in the story that it tells. Let’s examine
two income distributions:
Group 2
$44,264.00
$48,312.00
$55,252.40
$55,511.40
$56,532.00
$56,732.00
$56,739.20
$56,932.00
$57,899.20
$61,280.10

N-tiles
Another tool for looking at a distribution, such as
incomes for a given geography are N-tiles.
These are especially useful when you’re trying to
look at how well different income groups fare
over time. (Keep in mind that your numbers
would need to be adjusted for inflation.)
Here’s an example of income groups over time
in Santa Clara County, Calif.

140000
120000
HHinc 94$

Group 1
$22,132.00
$24,156.00
$35,462.00
$36,187.00
$56,532.00
$56,732.00
$56,932.00
$78,932.00
$79,302.00

ranges of each are pretty different. Group 1
incomes are concentrated on the extremes, so the
distribution looks like this:

Many of you are here because you know the
basics and you’re ready to move beyond basic
math. Much of what do with computer-assisted
reporting is sifting and sorting through data and
doing calculations, but sometimes you need a
more powerful tool.

First, let’s figure out what a statistic is:
1 : a branch of mathematics dealing with the
collection, analysis, interpretation, and
presentation of masses of numerical data
2 : a collection of quantitative data
That’s not so scary – you’ve been doing that all
along. You might think of statistics as using
statistical software such as STATA or SPSS or
SAS to run statistical tests or analyses. You
might think of statistics as dealing with survey or
poll data.
Why would you want to use something beyond
sifting and sorting and calculating? Some day,
you’ll run into data with which you need other
tools to tell the whole story. It’s sort of like the
different between showing a list of census tracts
and mapping the data – it shows you the patterns
that you can’t see any other way.
Let’s think about a particular type of data: school
test scores.
You have many ways you can provide your
readers information about the data. You could:
1. Just print the scores and let them figure
things out for themselves.
2. Print the scores showing increases and
decreases from previous years
3. Categorize the data -- the percent that scored
above the mean, below the mean
4. Break them into N-tiles
You might even to go further and ask WHY.
Why do certain schools do better or worse:
Smarter kids? Better teachers? Environmental
considerations? Mobility? Language? Substitute
teachers? Computers?
If you’re not an expert on school test scores, you
might see out an expert. You may ask experts
why – what do you they look at? They may tell
you that factors, such as poverty, mobility,
teacher experience, all play into how well kids
perform on standardized tests. But should you
just believe them?

With statistical software, you actually can test
these notions for yourself. You can tell in your
area how strong a factor teacher experience is on
how well kids perform.
Here are some tools and calculations that may
help you and your readers better understand your
data:
Indexes
An index is used to simplify the measurement of
movements in a numerical series or to compare a
set of numbers and is usually on an
understandable scale (0-1 or 0-100). Indices also
can be used to combine several variables.
Indexes are all around us: The Dow Jones
Industrial Average or the FBI’s crime index.
A good example of an index that combines
several values is the consumer price index (CPI).
The CPI represents all goods and services
purchased for consumption by urban households.
We have classified all expenditure items into
over 200 categories, arranged into 7 major
groups.
You could come up with your own sort of CPI,
depending on what you needed to look at. Let’s
say you’re supposed to look at costs for skiing at
various resorts. Rather than just comparing lift
tickets, you might realize that skiing is more than
just the price of a lift ticket. Your Cost-of-skiing
index might be made up of the cost of a lift
ticket, ski rental, transportation and an after
skiing drink. That would give you one number to
compare across all ski areas.

Punxy Phil’s Weather Index
To test the accuracy of
Pennsylvania’s famed
meteorological marmot, one might need to come
up with a sort of weather index combining
temperature, frozen precipitation and hours of
sunshine for six weeks following Feb. 2. Your
index could be made up of the number of days
below and above the median temperature, the
number of days with snow and the number of
hours fewer or more sunshine than normal.

Measuring Diversity
If Washington reporters can be accused of pack
political journalism, CAR reporters can be
accused of pack nerdiness. One particular index
hit its hey-day after the 2000 Census – the
Diversity Index, a cool tool developed years
earlier by Philip Meyer and Shawn McIntosh for
USA Today. The index measures the probability
that two people pulled at random from a given
area would be of a different race. The higher the
diversity, the more likely the two would of
different races.
“The USA Today diversity index solves this
problem with a probability-based index. The
index has a range from 0 to 1, and its value
represents the probability that two people chosen
at random from the study population will differ
along at least one ethnic dimension.”
(International Journal of Public Opinion
Research, Spring 1992).
Here’s the formula to calculate the Index of
Diversity:
Step 1:
Probability that two persons chosen from a
population at random will be members of the
same racial group: PR = (A2+B2+C2+D2) where
A, B, C & D are the proportions in the
population of whites, blacks, native Americans,
and Asians or Pacific islanders. (Using the
single-race total as the base.)
Step 2:
Compute the probability that two persons chosen
from a population at random will either be both
Hispanic or both not Hispanic. This is a separate
value because Census questionnaires ask
Hispanic origin in a different question from race.
Therefore it is possible to be both white and
Hispanic or black and Hispanic.
PH=(H2+N2)
Step 3:
Calculate the probability that two randomly
chosen persons are the same in both race and
Hispanic/non-Hispanic status: PR * PH
Subtract the result from 1: 1-( PR * PH)

The Gini coefficient
First of all, it’s not every day that
you get to use a big word like
“coefficient.” But other than
impressing your nerdy friends, the
Gini is a useful tool. This tool
was developed by Mr. Gini
(Italian economist Corrado Gini)
in 1912 to estimate the inequality of incomes and
wealth.
Special tools are needed to measure income
inequality because standard income
measurements, such as median, don’t give you
the whole picture.
Let’s consider two income distributions:
County 1 County 2
Range
100
18000
Less than $20,000
888
19001
$20,000 - $34,999
1000
19300
$35,000 - $44,999
1200
20000
$45,000 - $54,999
48800
30000
$55,000 - $75,000
50000
31600
$75,000 - $99,999
51800
32000
$100,000 to $150,000
70000
34000
More than $150,000

The median for both of these is $55,000;
however, the range is significantly different.
County 1 has incomes at extreme ends of the
spectrum, while county 2 tends to be in the
middle.
Because I didn’t have time to come up with a
good tool to measure inequality and Mr. Gini
had already done some all the work, I used a
spreadsheet to use the Gini formula. (which J.J.
Thompson had developed at the University of
North Carolina and provided to students in an
advanced NICAR boot camp a few years ago thanks J.J.!)
The data used for the Gini is categorical income
data such as that provided in Census figures. For
example: 500 people in the $10,000 to $14,999
category and so on... By multiplying the
midpoints of each category by the number of
people in the category, you can derive the

weighted income and therefore the other
parameters.
The result of the Gini is one number you can use
to compare your county to other counties or to
your county over time. Here’s the formula:
Gini=1-SUM(Xi-Xj)(Yi+Yj)

Where:
X is the cumulative proportion of
recipients
Y is the cumulative proportion of income
i is a particular income category
j is i-1 (the previous income category)
This is repeated for all the income categories and
then totaled so you end up with one number for
the county or whatever area you’re calculating.
You can calculate that same number for other
counties to compare geographically or to other
years to compare over time.

The higher the index, the more concentration and
(within limits) the less open market competition. A
monopoly, for example, would have an H index of
1002, or 10,000. By definition, that's the maximum
score. By contrast, an industry with 100 competitors
where each has 1 percent of the market would have a
score of 12 + 12 + 12+ ...12 or a total of 100.

What Schmitt found was that:
NASDAQ is supposed to keep investors' costs
low through spirited competition among the
firms that execute your orders to buy or sell
stocks.
But NASDAQ frequently doesn't operate that
way, a San Jose Mercury News examination
shows. Often, trading of a company's stock is
concentrated in the hands of only a few dealers.
And when that happens, the transaction costs for
investors are higher.

Competition
When he worked for the San Jose Mercury
News, Chris Schmitt wanted to look at market
competitiveness in the NASDAQ market, which
was claiming to be more competitive because of
the computerized system it used. Schmitt did
some research and started talking to experts.
He used a tool used by economists, the
Herfindahl-Hirschman Index. This index is based
on market shares of the players in a particular
marketplace. Viewing the dealers who trade a
particular NASDAQ stock as a marketplace, the
Mercury News applied this measure to the
market shares held by each dealer in that stock.
The HHI index is calculated as the sum of the
squares of the market shares held by each market
participant. Index values are interpreted as
follows:
<1,000 Competitive
1,000-1,800 Moderately Concentrated
>1,800 Highly concentrated
The H index is obtained by squaring the market-share
of each of the players, and then adding up those
squares. For example:
(%Share of company1)+(%share of company2)+…

Regression
This is a statistical tool that you can compute
using either Excel or a statistical program such
as SPSS or SAS. It does a couple of things. First,
it looks at the impact of external forces known as
independent variables on another variable (the
dependent one). It also allows you to level the
playing field and measure the true gain or loss of
one entity.
This tool frequently is used in school test score
analyses to find out what variable has the biggest
impact on school test scores and to use that
“model” to determine how well schools should
be doing. This will show you who’s performing
up to their abilities (given the factors you’ve
determined) and who’s not.
And things get fancier from here. There’s your
basic linear regression, logistic regression,
multivariate regression and so on. Before
applying this tool to a story, it’s good idea to
study up by taking an IRE stats course, taking a
local college stats course and befriending a local
professor to help verify your results.
