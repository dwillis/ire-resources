“A lot of the information that newspaper
organizations collect is relentlessly structured. It
just takes somebody to realize the structure (the
easy part), and it just takes somebody to start
storing it in a structured format (the hard part).”

Like any source, data can be
boring, irrelevant, misleading and wrong.

My data is the
most interesting,
relevant, on-point
and accurate data
in the world.

Background, interview
and fact-check your data.

The incidents were recorded as minor offenses and as a result did not
appear in the LAPD's published statistics on serious crime that
officials and the public use to judge the department's performance.
Nearly all the misclassified crimes were actually aggravated assaults.
If those incidents had been recorded correctly, the total aggravated
assaults for the 12-month period would have been almost 14% higher
than the official figure, The Times found.
The tally for violent crime overall would have been nearly 7% higher.

Got it. My data is squeaky clean.
Now what?

Data can be an anecdote

Are drastic swings in CRCT scores valid?
Statistically unlikely state test scores are showing up in more classrooms,
suggesting the cheating investigation that has engulfed four schools
might be about to widen.
An Atlanta Journal-Constitution investigation found 19 public
elementary schools statewide with extraordinary gains or drops in scores
between spring last year and this year. A dozen were in Atlanta.
In West Manor and Peyton Forest elementary schools, for instance,
students went from among the bottom performers statewide to among
the best over the course of one year. The odds of making such a leap were
less than 1 in a billion.

Where do I find Data?

If something is …
● inspected
● licensed
● regulated
● purchased
… there probably is a database

If there is a …
● report
● form
… there probably is a database

No API? None of the above?
You can create your own dataset
- crowdsource data from your audience
- e.g. journo salary survey, price of weed

- collect data using sensors
- e.g. WNYC cicada tracker

More way to quantify:
- Text analysis (e.g. sentiment)
- How many different people tweet from one
account?

- Image analysis
