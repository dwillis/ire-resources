Cultivating an Investigative Attitude

Getting and
assessing
ideas

• Places to look
• Assessing sources and tips
• How to avoid spinning your wheels

Laws

• They love to pass ‘em, but never figure out if
they worked as intended
• California Senate Office of Oversight
• Examples:
o Tax breaks that eat the budget
o Housing bond didn’t go to people named in
ballot measure
• Understanding the legal framework

Did the law
even get
implemented?

• In a surprising number of cases, agencies don’t
even do the thing the law says to
• Examples
o Safe sleep rules
o Agencies promised to share data on
abusers, never did
o Reports to the legislature – the story could
be what’s in the reports, or that the reports
were never done
• Same with initiatives – a “freeze” may be a
slight chill

Regulations

• Journalists often overlook them, especially on
state level
• But in many ways, they’re more important than
laws
• Registry in California
o Why is the regulation being passed?
o Is it authorized or “underground”
o Emergency regs – is it really an emergency?
o Example: prisoner petitions, what it reveals
about prison life
o Testimony

The California weekly bulletin

Government
archives

• Bill research
o What did people say when the law was
passed?
o Archives can show the discussion within the
administration and who lobbied it, info not
available at the time
o In California, Governor’s Chaptered Bill Files
o Example: Pictures from the 1960s showing
the dangers of working as a prison guard
o Annotated codes – bills and case law

Sources

• People who know things who never talk to
reporters
o Example: nursing home ombudsmen
o Lawyers are your friends
§ Not about current cases, but problems
in a system.
§ They cover much of the same ground we
do
§ Specialists, such as workers’ comp

Assessing
tipsters

Assessing
Tipsters

• Listen to everyone, you never know
• It’s OK if they have agendas – everyone does.
• Beware of generalities like “corruption” and
“malfeasance”
• Do they have specific info and ideas how to
prove it?
• Background them, especially if you’re quoting
them

Story criteria

• Is there a mother lode of compelling info?
o Examples: “Chief’s disease,” worker comp
decisions, reports of rehab deaths
• Can you identify victims, or is it more a
technicality?
• Consider human nature and incentives
o Example: Disabled Veteran Business
Enterprises
• Does it make you mad?
• How will you feel confronting the target?
• Does the target advertise in your publication?
• Listen to the little voice in your head

The sorry tale
of the DRX9000

The scientific
method

• Ask questions – where do crack vials come
from?
• Think like a scientist – hypothesis, data,
conclusion
• Be willing to be wrong, make adjustments
• Methodologies – what metrics will you use?
o Example: worker comp doctors – how often
overturned?
o “Chief’s disease” – anecdotes needing data
o Caregivers on Craigslist

• Plow through many documents to understand
how system works and terminology
• Link data in ways never meant to be

Methods

o Substance abuse counselors

• In places without a lot of data (Hawaii), build
your own!
• Actually go look at things – DVBE enterprises
• Use data to find people in certain categories –
state workers spiking pensions

Methods

• Compare to other jurisdictions – can reveal the
flaws in what you’re examining – WC neutral
appeal boards
• Just call people who you don’t think will talk –
you’d be surprised
o “This is all the result of buying Gray Davis.”
o Random people on LinkedIn, FB, etc. –
nurses in Salt Lake City
• Be careful what you put in emails or Slack!

Interviews

• Lots on this topic, these are just my
contributions
• It’s not easy to confront people with the worst
they’ve done – but you have to be straight and
tell them everything.
• Listen hard, don’t take scolding tone
• Be prepared, develop a strategy, even if you go
off it
• Don’t jam em

Writing

• What I said about interviewing
• Let the facts speak for themselves without
hyperventilating
• If you can, hold something back to keep people
reading by telling a story
• Be hyper-organized

Take
walks!!!
