Investigative Synopsis:
The courtrooms in Colorado went dark for three days in September while judges attended
a conference in Vail. Our hidden cameras captured judges turning the judicial education
into a taxpayer funded vacation. In addition to not attending, we found judges who
falsified legal affidavits certifying they attended classes when our cameras showed them
hiking and playing golf. Following our investigation, the Colorado Supreme Court
reconsidered its decision to host the conference at an upscale mountain resort and has
decided relocate to future conferences to Denver.
