For years, local television journalists (myself included) have complained about producing
investigative reports primarily for The Nielsen Beast. It is hitting an artificial deadline,
the argument goes, to plan investigative reporting around February, May and November.
How many of us can recall examples of having a story ready for air, only to be told to
hold it for sweeps?
Example : Station obtained hidden camera video of physical abuse in state hospital for
mentally retarded, then held it for one month until ratings period began.
Now that the ratings business is changing over from month- long sweeps periods to daily
meters, we are getting what we wished for. Be careful, as the cliché goes. While the
artificial deadlines are disappearing, so also may be the time we are provided to produce
high-quality, in-depth investigative journalism. The pressure is on now more than ever to
“get on the air”. The trick is to find a way to get on the air with a quick-hit piece that is
truly worthy of your investigative brand.
1) Put your investigative resources to work for general assignment reporters. Offer
help. Sometimes tha t could mean an investigative sidebar story for you, but it
could also just be an investigative element in a GA reporter’s story. Viewers may
not know you contributed, but your news director will.
2) Know what’s going on in the newsroom. Try to make sure someone from your
unit attends the morning meeting. That person should know the schedules for
everyone in the unit for that day and act as gatekeeper. Keep in constant touch
with the ever-changing daybook. Weigh in with your suggestions for daily stories.
3) Look for logical investigative follow-ups to general assignment stories. Example:
Pittsburgh DA blamed judge for allowing convicted felon Antonio Green to
stay out of jail after sentencing. Green allegedly shot a child. We ordered the
court transcript and showed the DA made the recommendation to the judge
to allow Green to remain free. That story aired the day after the general
assignment story.
4) Keep a stable of evergreen investigative projects on the shelf. These should be
more than ideas. Shoot interviews, documents and locators as you get the time.
Then, when your news director tells you he/she needs you on the air that day, you
can offer something original and investigative.

5) Watch other media in your market for unanswered questions in their investigative
pieces. Just because someone else gets the ball rolling doesn’t mean you have to
ignore it. There may be a great follow that the reporter of the original piece didn’t
see. Example: Pittsburgh Tribune -Review’s investigation of city councilman
and his use of city cars. Good piece, but they gave him wiggle room in his
explanation. Didn’t bring down the hammer. We proved he was lying and
brought it down with force. When we tried to ask the councilman about our
findings, he ran from the camera.
MY FAVORITE WEBSITES FOR EVERYDAY REPORTING:
Federal court records (subscriber service):
This site is about to get a whole lot better. Soon most courts in the country will have all
court filings (including criminal) available online. Criminal filings are slated to be public
11/1/04 (that's for filings made on or after 11/1/04.)
