Data collection

Requesting the data
We started in 2014 and now have 31 states and more than
130 million records of state patrol stops.

Data availability
Detailed data available in 20 of the 31 states

Data come in myriad formats

Extracting common fields
Date and time
Location [ county or state patrol district ]
Driver demographics [ race, gender and age ]
Stop reason
Search indicator
Search justification [ e.g., probable cause or consent ]
Search outcome
Stop outcome [ e.g., citation or arrest ]

Complex data pipeline
We have released all data cleaning code
[ See Stanford Open Policing Project website ]
We include original and standardized values side-by-side in
the released data.

Testing for
discrimination

Search rates
Black and Hispanic drivers are searched about twice as often
as white drivers.
But such difference are not strong evidence of bias.
[ There might, for example, be differences in behavior. ]

The threshold test
A new statistical test for discrimination
The test lets us infer the standard of evidence officers apply
when deciding whom to search.
A lower search threshold for one group relative to another
indicates discrimination.
The test is based on both the search rate and the search
success rate.

The threshold test
Evidence that black and Hispanic drivers are searched
on the basis of less evidence than whites

Collaboration was key
Journalism

Engineering

Data journalism classes
negotiated for the public
records and analyzed
the data for stories.
Poynter Institute held
workshops to train
journalists in analyzing
the data.

A team of engineering
graduate students built a
pipeline to clean and
standardize the data. The
engineering team also
developed a new statistical
test to measure
discrimination.
