Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico
• Made landfall on September 20, 2017
• Hurricane Irma had previously hit the island with Category 1-force winds on
September 6, 2017

• The power grid that serves approximately 3.3 million residents went oﬄine
indeﬁnitely

• 86% of all cell phone towers were knocked out, as well as the vast majority
of internet and telephone lines

• 70 thousand homes were damaged
• Over $90 billion in damages
• Breakdown in essential medical services

Death Toll
• Government’s oﬃcial count has remained at 64 for several months
• In November 2017 the Center for Investigative Journalism reported that there was
a 43% jump in excess deaths in the 10 days following the hurricane

• In December The New York Times placed the number of excess deaths after the
hurricane at 1,052

• In February the Puerto Rican government contracted the George Washington
University School of Public Health to do an independent review of the death
count

• At the end of May a study led by Harvard University’s School of Public Health
estimated that the number of excess deaths could be in a range between nearly
800 and and 8,500

• The Puerto Rico Demographic Registry ﬁnally released data that showed 1,247
excess deaths from September to December 2017

Breakdown in
health services
• Many of the island’s 69 hospitals were left without power
for days and weeks at a time

• A sustained blackout aﬀected a majority of island
residents for more than three months

• In the ﬁrst two months after the hurricane, logistical and
communications problems kept emergency personnel and
resources from reaching critical institutions

Power Restoration
• Hurricanes Irma and Maria damaged 80% of the power grid
• Three months after Maria, roughly half of Puerto Ricans remained
without power

• The story of Whiteﬁsh, a little-known ﬁrm from Montana that netted
a power restoration deal with Puerto Rico worth $300 million, came
out in late October

• By December 2018 the Puerto Rico Government was announcing
the privatization of its Public Power Utility

• Six months after the hurricane, 11% of Puerto Rico was still
without electricity
