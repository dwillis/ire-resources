Star Tribune (Minneapolis)
Pioneer Press (St. Paul, MN)
Data: National Inventory of
Bridges
Findings: Following the
collapse of an I-35 bridge
spanning the Mississippi River in
Minneapolis, journalists,
including Dan Browning and
MaryJo Webster, turned to the
National Bridge Inventory
database, available from IRE
and NICAR, to check the
bridge's inspection history. The
Start Tribune and The Pioneer
Press reported that inspection
data from 2005 showed that the
Minnesota Department of
Transportation deemed the
bridge “structurally deficient.”
The Pioneer Press also noted a
federal reporting finding that
Minnesota had 3 percent of its
bridges rated deficient in 2006.
