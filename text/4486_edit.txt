IRE NATIONAL CONFERENCEPHILADELPHIA
June 6, 2015
Investigating what we eat
Pesticides, hormones, antibiotics, bacteria and inadequate inspections have
turned food into a hot subject for investigation. This panel will cover how to
get behind hype and government stonewalling to report on food safety in an
era of global trade. Topics include labeling and what consumers need to
know.

Speakers:

The debate over food safety and labeling is always active, but has been heating up in
recent months. International trade agreements that could force the U.S. to cancel countryof origin labeling on meat. A new effort to give the USDA recall authority over
dangerous foods (which is now voluntary) and a new labeling requirement for
mechanically-tenderized beef.
Here are a few of my favorite food safety resources:

Antibiotics in Food Animals

@duffwilson

About 80% of antibiotics by quantity in the U.S. are used in food animal production -largely unregulated. For years, growers have been receiving powerful antibiotics without
prescriptions to give to healthy animals to promote feed efficiency and faster growth.
That’s a breeding ground for antibiotic-resistant "superbugs." Their usage is poorly
tracked. Some of these antibiotics are the very same ones used in human medicine. Their
overuse on farms raises concerns about adding to human resistance to antibiotics.

The FDA is taking steps to better track antibiotic usage on farms and to apply veterinary
oversight -- steps that will raise new issues about exactly where and how the antibiotics
are used, classifying their use as "disease prevention" versus growth promotion, and the
role and influence on the gatekeeper veterinarians. Our series uncovered "feed tickets"
listing drugs supplied to chicken growers that even the government hadn’t seen, and we
investigated the potential financial conflicts of interest of veterinarians.

Data: How much of which antibiotics are used in what species and where? The U.S.
government doesn’t know. There is no killer data aggregation on antibiotics in food
animal production. To date, companies don't report it by type of animal or location. The
FDA's annual data release under the Animal Drug User Fee Act of 2003 tracks total
volume. Latest reports:

Your Food: What do you really know?

A 19-part series that aired during November, 2014. The opener revealed the spike in food
imports and the decline in inspections. Other parts examined organic fruits, vegetables
and meat, pesticide residue, hormones in milk, antibiotics in meat, GMOs, irradiated
beef.
Buying local may be what some shoppers prefer, but the trends are clear; two-thirds of all
fruits and vegetables and 80 percent of all seafood comes from other countries. Imported
produce is especially prevalent in the northeast during the winter months. Strawberries
from Mexico, grapes from Chili, and asparagus from Peru are routinely found in area
grocery stores.
Despite an exploding increase in the volume of food imports, The Food and Drug
Administration at best, inspects less than two percent of what comes in.
For the rest, the FDA depends on exporting countries and import companies to make sure
that their products meet U.S. standards. That poses a special problem when the food is

coming from countries that have lower standards than the U.S.

The FDA uses an electronic tool to decide which items to inspect according to its
PREDICT system
http://www.fda.gov/downloads/ForIndustry/ImportProgram/UCM316476.pdf
Among the foods that do get inspected, the FDA intercepts thousands of products unfit
for human consumption. http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/international-markets-trade/usagricultural-trade/import-share-of-consumption.aspx

All imported products regulated by the FDA are included from food to drugs to medical
devices.This all goes back to the FDA’s policies, which depend on the food producers to
control quality as detailed in the most recent FDA regulations known as the Food Safety
Modernization Act.

Growing with Pesticides

California’s strawberry growers rely on heavy amounts of dangerous pesticides
called fumigants to deliver fruit year-round at an affordable price.
Fumigants, however, have been linked to cancer, developmental problems and ozone
depletion.
The $2.6 million industry’s preferred fumigant, methyl bromide, was supposed to be
banned by 2005, but California strawberry growers are largely the only ones in the
developed world left using it.
With the ban looming, state pesticide regulators allowed growers to blow through the
health limits on another fumigant, 1,3-D, despite concerns from state scientists.
The decision increased cancer risk for people living in more than 100 California
communities
