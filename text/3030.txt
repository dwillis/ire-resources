TWO ESSENTIAL PIECES OF INFORMATION: SHAPEFILES AND ICS‐209s
Find the Maps
 Whenever a fire hits, somebody sitting in a basement or a trailer somewhere is making a shapefile that you
want.
• Cal Fire
• The San Diego County Office of Emergency Services
• Somebody else in your neck of the woods
 Get the shapefile.
Google It
 Make a KML out of that shape file and put it up on a Google map – grab someone from your organization’s
Web site to help.
 Hand draw the KML in Google Earth if you have to while you find that guy with the shapefile.
Incident Command Structure (ICS)
 Emergency responders not only take care of the emergency, they also push a ton of paper.
 Most command centers in charge of fighting wildfires should have to file incident summary forms twice
daily with the US Forest Service. Get these ICS‐209 Incident Summary Reports: They add a wealth of
information about how the fires and how they were fought. They’re available electronically.

PUTTING IT TOGETHER: A VISUAL TIME LINE
Shapefiles show the fire progression.
ICS 209s add a wealth of information about a fire and how it is being fought.
Mapping the burned structures can show areas of particular intensity and devastation. When the unofficial
lists of addresses started flowing in, we associated a parcel number with every address to eliminate
duplicates and geocode each address. In San Diego County, SanGIS offers parcel data for the entire county
in a shapefile. We striped out the DBF and make it searchable on the intranet, so it was easy to do this.
 You can add a ton of other information to this as well, such as fire threat maps, reverse 911 calls, etc.

OTHER POTENTIALLY USEFUL DATA
ICS‐220 reports: Air‐operation summaries that report the number and location of personnel available for
flight and deployable aviation resources.
 Aircraft Information Management System (AIMS): Filed by regional air attack bases. Closest estimation of
flight times for fixed‐wing aircraft. Show when and how long aircraft flew, including amount of retardants
dropped and costs of flights.
 Computer‐aided dispatch (CAD): A GIS‐bases system that uses location, travel routes, hazards and
equipment to determine the closest unit to send to an incident
 California All Incident Reporting System (CAIRS): A program that collects statistical information reported
by Cal Fire. Includes numbers of fires, causes of fires, types of fires, location of fires, and fire‐caused deaths.
Helps fire departments target their resources, legislation and education programs.
 Resource Ordering and Status System (ROSS): A resource ordering application that provides support and
coordination of all risk incidents by providing current status of resources, enabling dispatch offices to
exchange and track resource order information electronically and exchange mission‐critical messages.
Provides a cumulative and historical database of incident information.
