Policing the Police

1. Request department policies on police behavior. This will help you identify violations
that may not be obvious. If there are no policies, that’s a story, too.
2. Request internal affairs complaints and investigations. These are public in many
jurisdictions. Many agencies keep logs that can help you identify cases of interest.
3. Cross-reference internal affairs findings and department discipline with court records
to find out if cops are getting breaks from the legal system.
4. Contact non-police witnesses mentioned in internal affairs files or court records and
request transcripts or tapes of their interviews. When it comes to police behavior,
investigators may soft-pedal witness statements in their reports.
5. Look for alternative agencies that may keep data. If officials at your local department
say they don’t have the data you need or refuse to give it to you, check with state or
federal agencies.
6. Don’t take no for an answer. Are officials telling you the data you want is not public?
Talk with your lawyer and convince them otherwise, in court if necessary.
7. Spot-check your data against paper records. Does the result of a query seem too good
to be true? It may be.
8. Request squad video of questionable incidents. Patrol cars often have cameras that
capture traffic stops and roadside arrests.
9. Share the results with the police agencies well before you publish to give them time to
comment and an opportunity to take issue with anything you’ve done.
10. If you will be naming individual officers, contact them directly rather than through
the police department. If they ignore telephone calls and email, send certified letters to
their home addresses that clearly state your findings and request an interview. Someone
will inevitably take you up on it.
