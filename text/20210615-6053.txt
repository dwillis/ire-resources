Video Open Source tips for collecting footage
Youtube, Twitter, Instagram, Twitch, Periscope, Facebook, TikTok, open call
○ Do an “open call” on your website/social media for participants to
submit footage.
○ Look at metadata for both open call footage and footage you find
online - have your contributors send you screenshots.
○ Look through the sources’ social media to vet them.
○ Reach out and interview them for more info/bg.
○ Get releases. In some cases, you may have to pay them.
○ After you look at a lot of videos from one event, it will become clearer
what videos are not from that event.

Working with the footage to report out the facts
○ Take screenshots of anything that provides potential IDs (ie: badges,
insignia, weaponry) for the investigative reporters to follow up on.
○ Make a list of the conflicting questions your footage can answer.(Ex: was
there a clear dispersal order?)

Line up footage on an Adobe Premiere timeline - the “Sync.” Audio cues
are a useful sync point, ie: a large identifiable series of bangs.

If possible, create a map to reference the camera vantage points:

If possible, go on-scene afterwards to record your own footage and
understand the overview/fill in blanks of your perspective of the scene.
Leverage the video evidence when following up with authorities.
