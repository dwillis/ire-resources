Strategies:
1) Triangulate by using states that have good data that can help you find similar
players/issues in your state.
● Lobbying:
○ States where lobbyists register positions on bills
■ CA - lists lobbyist positions in lobbyist filings and in bill analyses
■ CO - can search lobbyist positions by bill number
https://www.sos.state.co.us/lobby/SearchSubject.do
■ IA - can search for all positions taken on bills by client or lobbyist
https://www.legis.iowa.gov/lobbyist/reports/declarations?ga=87&ba=
SF481
■ MA - can search for lobbyists & positions by bill number or description
http://www.sec.state.ma.us/LobbyistPublicSearch/
■ NJ - can search for obbyists & positions by bill number or issue
https://www3-elec.mwg.state.nj.us/ELEC_AGAA/EntitySearch.aspx
■ WI - can search by bill or topic or budget subject
https://lobbying.wi.gov/What/WhatAreTheyLobbyingAbout/2017REG
○ Lobbyists’ swanky dinners etc. In some states these would be indicated in
general lobbyist and/or expenditure filings. Also:
■ IA - “function reports” ​https://www.legis.iowa.gov/lobbyist/reports
■ MD - “event reports”
■ NJ - “lobbying activity search”
https://www3-elec.mwg.state.nj.us/ELEC_AGAA/LobbyingActivitySearc
h.aspx
○ States in which lobbyists have to indicate whether they are lobbying the
executive branch - CA, NY, FL, OH (OH indicates which agency usually).
Also:
■ Connecticut: expenditures on behalf of lobbying the executive branch
https://www.oseapps.ct.gov/NewLobbyist/PublicReports/PublicReport.

■ Idaho: executive branch lobbying indicated in “scanned reports” for
expenditures by lobbyists
■ Illinois: can search lobbyist expenditures made on officials
● Search legislative testimony:
○ Digital Democracy, allows users to search all statements made in state
legislative hearings for California, Florida, New York and Texas so far:
https://www.digitaldemocracy.org/
○ Nevada allows you to search legislative committee minutes ​here​. You can
also easily find who testified on certain bills, etc., in the state’s ​NELIS
system.
○ Maine’s legislative website allows easy access to written forms of committee
testimony on bills. ​http://www.mainelegislature.org/
○ Illinois groups witnesses at legislative committee hearings into
proponent/opponent/no position. You can find those positions and
testimonies for committee hearings here: ​http://my.ilga.gov/
○ Best state legislative website for easy access to video of committee
testimony: Tennessee.
2) Search industry and advocacy groups’ sites for issues they are tracking, newsletters
where they brag about their legislative victories, which legislators are most supportive etc.
Use Advanced Google to search for PDF and other items on a specific site:
https://www.google.com/advanced_search
3) Search national advocacy groups’ online materials for events, guest lists for which state
officials attend, such as the Republican Attorneys General Association conferences, the

Democratic Governors Association, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners
conferences, ALEC meetings, etc. to see how special interests may be courting your
officials.
4) Does your state have gift disclosures, lobbyist disclosures, online legislative logbooks?
● Sometimes you can pull those into Document Cloud to make them easier to search.
For example, we made the legislative journals for Michigan easier to search:

ial-logbooks
● Consider asking for blank copies of the forms officials need to fill out so you know the
fields of data you might be able to use.
