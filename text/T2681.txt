Half of the EU budget (55,448,703,744 € out of 112 billion/69,514,131,068 $) (http://eurlex.europa.eu/budget/data/D2006_VOL4/EN/nmc-titleN123A5/index.html) is used for
subsidising farming and food exports. However until the summer of 2004 we had nothing but
statistics (http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/agrista/2005/table_en/index.htm).
In the US data have been accessible for years:

EU-FOI
EU’s Access to documents regulation came into force in December 2001. It requires public
registers of all documents in EU-institutions and is the legal basis for EU FOI.

Applications are sent to the different institutions of the EU: The Commission (setting the
agenda, drafting bills and administrating policies), the Council of Ministers (ministers of the 25
