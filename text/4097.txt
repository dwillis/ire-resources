About this template
This template provides a a project skeleton suitable for NPR projects that are designed to be served as flat
files. Facilities are provided for rendering html from data, compiling LESS into CSS, deploying to S3,
installing cron jobs on servers, copy-editing via Google Spreadsheets and a whole bunch of other stuff.
This codebase is licensed under the MIT open source license. See the !LICENSE! file for the complete license.
Please note: logos, fonts and other media referenced via url from this template are not covered by this
license. Do not republish NPR media assets without written permission. Open source libraries in this
repository are redistributed for convenience and are each governed by their own license.
Also note: Though open source, This project is not intended to be a generic solution. We strongly encourage
those who love the app-template to use it as a basis for their own project template. We have no plans to
remove NPR-specific code from this project.

Assumptions
The following things are assumed to be true in this documentation.
You are running OSX.
You are using Python 2.7. (Probably the version that came OSX.)
You have virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper installed and working.
You have NPR's AWS credentials stored as environment variables locally.
For more details on the technology stack used with the app-template, see our development environment
blog post.

Copy the template
Create a new repository on Github. Everywhere you see !$NEW_PROJECT_NAME! in the following script, replace it
with the name of the repository you just created.
git!clone!git@github.com:nprapps/appFtemplate.git!$NEW_PROJECT_NAME
cd!$NEW_PROJECT_NAME

mkvirtualenv!FFnoFsiteFpackages!$NEW_PROJECT_NAME
pip!install!Fr!requirements.txt
fab!app_template_bootstrap

This will setup the new repo and will replace !README.md! (this file) with !PROJECT_README.md!. See that file for
usage documentation.
By default !app_template_bootstrap! will use !nprapps! as the Github username, and the current directory name
as the project name and repository name. This is a best practice, but you can override these defaults if you
need to:
fab!app_template_bootstrap:$GITHUB_USERNAME,$PROJECT_NAME,$REPOSTORY_NAME

Bootstrap issues
The app-template can automatically setup your Github repo with our default labels and tickets by running
!fab!bootstrap_issues!. You will be prompted for your Github username and password.
