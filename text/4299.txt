Tracking Diseases
IRE Computer-Assisted Reporting Conference
March 2015

Typical Data Questions And Answers
• --When? (When did something happen? Did it happen
at a different time than officials said it did? The best
data has a field that shows the date. Allows for visual
elements, including timelines.)
• --Where? (Location is another important field in data
analysis. The more precise the better—especially GPS
coordinates. Allows for interactive/visual elements,
including mapping.)
• --How much? (Expenses or costs can give you a sense
of the scope of something, and the importance of it by
where the money was – and was not –spent. Also
allows for sortable/chartable material.)

Some Things To Keep in Mind
• All datasets are problematic—in their own way.
• Talk to the keeper of the data, understand what the
fields mean, don’t presume
• Explain to experts, or the data keeper what you found.
Ask if you’ve done anything wrong
• Give ample opportunity for the “target” of your
investigation to understand how you’ve done your
analysis and to challenge it.
• In this case: The UN data isn’t comprehensive, only
what has been publically announced
• The “decision date” was loosely defined
