The Delta Initiatives:
A THREADBARE LEGACY
By JEFF PORTER
Arkansas Democrat-Gazette
By now, every student in the Mississippi River Delta
should be testing at or above the national average. Old
people should be close to health services. No one should
have to live in a shack.
Those are all goals of the decade-old Delta Initiatives
report, a blueprint for a federal promise that things were
going to get better.
Tell that to the people in Pine City.
Their school district, Holly Grove in Monroe County, is
not the worst-performing in the Delta, but most of its test
scores are still far below average. Their closest hospitals
are in Helena and Stuttgart, nearly an hour's drive away.
Their houses are interspersed among abandoned shacks
and, in some cases, falling in themselves.
