TIPSHEET: Investigating Political Influence
STRATEGIES AND CONSIDERATIONS WHEN COVERING INFLUENCE AT
AGENCIES
Here are some questions to ask yourself and your sources:
1. What is the historical mandate (charter) and origin of the agency?
2. What is the industry regulated, and what and who is the agency supposed to be protecting?
3. What sort of individuals are most qualified to fulfill the mandate?
4. Is the mandate clear or does it create conflicting beneficiaries?
5. When a person unlikely to be able to regulate objectively is in there, how did that happen?
Was it the result of the proverbial "revolving door"?
6. If so, how common is that at the agency? How about during previous administrations?
7. What's the practical effect of that person being there?
8. What campaign donations did this person or his/her previous employer make?
9. What long-term patterns and historic relationships made it possible for this company to place
its former employees in such posts?
10. How long do senior folks stay at the agency? When they leave, where do they go? Lobby
firm? Trade association? Contributions to politicians after they left? Relationships between those
pols and the regulatory agency? Correspondence? Meeting logs? Represent firms with matters
before the agency? (How to find them...old Yellow Books, LinkedIn)
10. How did a company and/or an industry get a particularly interesting contract/permission/etc?
11. Was there competitive bidding? What do the losing bidders have to say? Is there a record of a
challenge at the GAO? With Inspector General? Relevant congressional committee?
Whistleblower organizations?
