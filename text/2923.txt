DISCIPLINED DOCTORS
DocInfo.org
The Federation of State Medical Board has a searchable database at of disciplinary information
from state and federal licensing and regulatory agencies as well as counterparts in Canada, England, Australia and New Zealand. It covers MDs, DOs and PAs but does not include information
on malpractice claims or settlements. It is updated quarterly and, in some cases, monthly. Access
costs $9.95 whether or not any disciplinary record is found.
http://www.docinfo.org/

[NOTE: a more thorough but restricted version of the database is online at http://www.drdata.org/
and might be available through some of your clients.]

HealthGrades.com
HealthGrades.com allows searches for records on more than 650,000 physicians, by last name and
state of practice. Records cost $6 each. Although the records do state when there have been recent
sanctions, the site’s rating system has been attacked as inaccurate by the folks at Quackwatch.
http://www.healthgrades.com/
[NOTE: the site also offers for-pay nursing home searches and free searches for hospital ratings
with links to the Leapfrog assessments.

ChoiceTrust
ChoiceTrust has a for-pay database with sources including the AMA physician master file, DEA
and FDA sanctions, Medicare/Medicaid fraud violations and state disciplinary records. ChoiceTrust charges nothing for very basic information but $9.95 for details including disciplinary actions. You can get unlimited searches for 24 hours if you pay $19.95.

QuestionableDoctors.org
Public Citizen has a searchable database that covers doctors in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, but it is not accepting new subscribers and does not appear to be updating the data. In ad-

dition to disciplinary actions taken by state medical boards, the database includes actions taken by the Medicare/
Medicaid programs, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Drug Enforcement Agency.
The data appears to go back to about 1990 in many instances and to go forward through 2001 or 2002. The site is
very good at explaining the origins and limits of each data element, and it may be worth your while to find someone with continuing access.

BOARD SPECIALIZATIONS

There are 24 official groups that certify medical specialists and more than 100 unofficial boards from ringside
medicine to forensic psychiatry. Some are little more than diploma mills. The generally acknowledged gatekeeper
is the American Board of Medical Specialties. To see whether the doctor’s credentials come from an ABMSapproved board, check:
http://www.abms.org/
[NOTE: An article by Sandra G. Boodman identifying many of the unaccredited boards appeared in the Washington Post on July 12, 1994.]

DEBARRED DOCTORS

The federal government keeps an overall list of persons and companies banned from doing business with the government or receiving benefits from it. Specific agencies such as the Department of Health and Human Services and the
Drug Enforcement Agency maintain sites as well.
The overall list is at:
http://www.arnet.gov/epls/

The DHHS site for exclusions from Medicare/Medicaid is at:
http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov/search.html

The DEA lists revocations and denials of licenses to prescribe at:
http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/fed_regs/index.html
The FDA’s debarment list is at:
http://www.fda.gov/ora/compliance_ref/debar/default.htm

New Jersey has its own site at:
http://www.state.nj.us/treasury/debarred/

CORPORATE INTEGRITY AGREEMENTS
Short of debarments, the DHHS Inspector General’s Office sometimes settle investigations by having doctors and
other individuals and businesses sign agreements governing future conduct and known as Corporate Integrity Agreements, Certification of Compliance Agreements or Settlement Agreements With Integrity Provisions. The agreements are public at http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/cia/index.html.

DEADBEAT DOCTORS
Did the doctor repay all his or her student loans? You can check not only medical doctors but all chiropractors, dentists, naturopaths et al. at:
http://www.defaulteddocs.dhhs.gov/cgi-bin/ddocs_counter.pl

DAUBERT/KUMHO TIRE ISSUES

Mdex OnLine
Mdex Online claims to track all reported and unreported cases in which experts are qualified or disqualified on the
basis of federal and state evidentiary gatekeeping standards including Daubert, Kumho Tire and Joiner. Searches are
prices at $10 per half hour and include more than 14,000 case records and 16,000 expert records
http://www.mdexonline.com/index.cfm
[NOTE: you may be able to duplicate this search on Lexis/Westlaw by the right set of keywords. However, this database also claims to have “direct links to core documents including opinions, docket sheets, briefs and transcripts.”]

DOCTOR DEPOSITIONS AND VERDICTS/SETTLEMENTS

MalpracticeDepositions.Com
Bruce Maston, a doctor and attorney in Phildaelphia, has a site with information on depositions, expert reports,
verdicts and settlements.
To get to the search screens, click on “continue” at the bottom of the page at:
http://www.malpracticedepositions.com
From there, you can click onto searchable databases of expert depositions/reports and of verdicts and settlements. The depositions/reports appear to require a trade, although the name of the law firm supplying them is
free. The verdict and settlement information is free.

AVAILABLE WITH RESTRICTIONS TO SOME HOSPITALS, HEALTH PLANS AND PLAINTIFF ATTORNEYS
Two other federal databanks that collect adverse information about physicians and other healthcare providers are not
available to the general public but can be searched by government agencies and others, including, in some instances, employing hospitals, health plans and attorneys representing a patient who is suing the doctor for malpractice.

The National Practitioner Data Bank
NPDB is intended to hinder the movement of "problem practitioners" from one facility or state to another. Licensing boards are required to report all actions that revoke, suspend, or restrict a license for reasons related to professional competence or conduct; professional societies report adverse reviews and hospitals must report disciplinary
actions that reduce privileges for more than 30 days, In addition, malpractice carriers must report all settlements.
The Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank
HIPDB is intended to combat fraud and abuse. It has data on criminal convictions, exclusions from federal and
state health-care programs, non-malpractice, health-related civil judgments and other matters.
http://www.npdb-hipdb.com/
To see whether you are eligible for the full NPDB data, go to:
http://www.npdb-hipdb.com/npdb.html and read the section entitled Access to Information.
To see whether you are eligible for the full HIPDB data, go to:
http://www.npdb-hipdb.com/hipdb.htm and read the section entitled Access to Information.

PATIENT RECORDS
The Medical Information Bureau, an insurers’ anti-fraud database, is located in Waltham, Massachusetts can be subpoenaed for information on some individual patient conditions, including some substance abuse issues.

OTHER RECORDS

In addition to the practitioner and patient data described above, there are numerous other medical databases, such as the
MAUDE database of medical devices, that may be relevant in cases involving medical care but are beyond the scope of
this paper. Physicians with appointments at universities and government agencies are also subject to additional disclosures, internally and through databases like the Community of Science.
