Tip Sheet for Organizing Projects

Ask what other people want and what they’re afraid of. (They’re scared you’ll
steal all the good stories).

Set goals for the enterprise reporting you want. (Be clear about what’s expected
from everyone. If the suburban staff should produce one project a month, you have to tell them).

Talk about what you’re going to do. (Nobody likes surprises. Many have good ideas).
Develop a system that mines ideas from all your staff. (Does everyone really
understand how to pitch something? Are any of your story ideas from shy people?).

Include everyone with a stake in the story. (Build teams early, which gets you good
input and buy-in from those who’ll do the work. Make sure you’re telling stories with more than words).

Our list:
Reporter
Photographer
Graphics artist
Designer
Copy editor
Word editor
Library/researcher Online editor
TV partner
Managing editor (see “nobody likes surprises” above).
Evolve because times change (and sometimes you’re wrong).

Pitfalls happen. Pay attention to what can trip you up. (Office politics, miserly
budgets, petty jealousy, and a swarm of other annoyances).

Teach, and find other ways to ensure your team isn’t isolated. (Work a night
shift, work a weekend, give reporters outside your team the first byline).

And three key steps you can take:
1. Make sure you have your philosophy straight: Enterprise is
part of everyone’s beat, not something you get to when there’s time.
2. Talk with the people who are going to do the work, not just
their bosses.
3. Celebrate successes. Don’t be too cool to thank people. Buy
Thai food or bagels for the copy desk.
