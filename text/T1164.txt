Some tips
1) So, you don’t have data … don’t give up!
You come to the IRE or NICAR conferences and hear about wonderful story ideas for
investigations you can’t find – or can’t obtain – data for in your own country. If this is the case,
check if you can create your own databases from paper records or even better, search for
information about your country somewhere else outside the national borders.
Example: Jose Roberto de Toledo of the Folha de Sao Paulo constructed a database of more
than 100 cases of multiple homicides for 1998 as a way to profile the victims. For more examples
and information check the Uplink issue of March, 2000.
2) Do not reinvent the wheel!
Check the IRE Resource Center for story ideas and NICAR for ready-to-go, cleaned databases.
The addresses are http://www.ire.org/resourcecenter and http://www.nicar.org
3) Get familiar with the Freedom of Information Act.
A good-starting place is the Freedom of Information Center at the Missouri School of Journalism.
Besides providing excellent guides on using the FOI as well as sample letters and contacts at
federal agencies for FOIA requests, you will be able to find out what other FOIA requesters are
asking the government. What for? To increase your network of sources potentially willing to share
their information with you.
Example: The Center has made available a detailed example about FOIA logs from the Persian
Gulf War at http://web.missouri.edu/~foiwww/foialogs/gulffoialog.html
4) Create your toolkit of online resources and check it regularly.
The U.S. government and other agencies and institutions are being very good about updating
their information and making it available in an electronic format. When creating your online toolkit
of U.S. sources, make sure to check:
•
•
•
•

Public agencies.
Private institutions.
Watchdog and non-for-profit organizations.
University libraries and historical archives.

5) If you haven't done it already, spend A LOT of time online.

Topics to look at
You name them. For almost every issue you can find tons of databases and/or online resources.
A few examples are: U.S. foreign affairs, arms trafficking, immigration, drug dealing, environment,
health research, biotechnology, nuclear power, business …

Where to look for data

malfunctioned or caused a death or serious injury. The data is also available in zipped files for
downloading.
