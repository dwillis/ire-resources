For Profit Colleges – Fact Sheet
1. While for-profit schools account for just 10 percent of total enrollments, they account
for more than 25 percent of all Federal student aid disbursed.
 $26.5 Billion in federal aid went to for-profit schools in 2009
o More than $4 billion in Pell grants
o $20 billion in loans backed by the federal government
2. For profit-students have more overall debt:
 96 percent of students at for-profit degree granting colleges borrow to pay for college
 compared to 13 percent at community colleges
 48 percent at four-year public
 57 percent at four-year private colleges.
3. For-profit students are more likely to default on loans. For-profit schools have just 10 percent
of students, but account for nearly 50 percent of all student loan defaults.
 Close to 1 in 4 students at a for-profit school is defaulting within 3 years
 Defaults by students at for-profit schools account for 47% of all student loan
defaults.
4. At many for-profits, federal dollars now account for more than 80% of revenue.
 At least 87.4 percent of revenue at 14 large for-profit schools comes from federal
taxpayer dollars, and at least four of those schools receive more than 90 percent of
revenues from federal dollars.
5. Many for-profit schools spend more on recruiting than educating students.
 Eight publicly traded schools devoted nearly 50 percent or more of their spending to
marketing, recruiting and administrative expenses outside of education.
6. Fifteen of 15 for-profit schools visited by the Government Accountability Office in May and
June 2010 during an undercover investigation engaged in fraudulent, deceptive or otherwise
questionable practices to recruit new students.
7. Attending for-profit schools is most often more expensive than public and community
colleges.

$40,000 a year, Corinthian’s Everest charges over $46,000, ITT charges over $44,000
and Westwood College charges over $35,000.
 In each case, a community college offering a comparable program costs between
$6,000 and $9,000.
 Similarly high tuition is found in bachelor degree programs. At ITT, almost $89,000
-- at Corinthian, over $81,000 -- and at Westwood, over $70,000.
 Meanwhile a flagship public school offers the same programs for $25,000 to
$40,000.
