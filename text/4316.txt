Some thoughts for putting data to
work on the beat
• Know what “easy” data is out there that might give signals
about what’s news on your beat
• Publicly searchable database or look-ups you can put to use
• Keep a close eye on whatever new data becomes available
about the agencies or companies you cover
• Track changes to websites in case government agencies
release new data without publicity
• Data can drive stories, but it also can guide reporting behind
the scenes
• Can data help you identify potential sources?
• Can it help you decide where to tell your story?
• Go after data on your own. Try making requests to agencies at
different levels of government
