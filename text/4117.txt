That 'Dam' Data
Counting and Summing with SQL + Amazing Puns
A SQL Refresher:

SELECT – everything you'd like to get in your query. * means "all fields"
FROM – what table you're using
WHERE – conditions (e.g. county = "Arlington")
ORDER BY – how you want to sort your fields

We'll learn about a new clause:

 GROUP BY – for a field we will use to aggregate or summarize data, for example, counting or summing
all records associated with one county that appears multiple times in a table
In English, please?
Let's say you have the following fruits:
SQL way of putting fruits into the "category" they belong to.

GROUP BY is just the

So when we write GROUP BY we're essentially categorizing …

So let's say instead of actual fruit, we had this information in a table called fruit.
fruit_type

cost

apple

$0.50

orange

$0.75

apple

$1.25

banana

$0.35

apple

$0.65

banana

$0.25

orange

$0.95

apple

$0.85

apple

$1.05

To count the fruit types, we'd use the function COUNT(*) in our SELECT statement. Like Excel, SQL is full of
functions. Our query will return a new column with the counts of each fruit type. We can say COUNT(*) AS
total_fruit to give our new column the name total_fruit. Again, the * means "all."
SELECT fruit_type, count(*) AS total_fruit
FROM fruit
GROUP BY fruit_type;

And we'd get ….
fruit_type

total_fruit

apple

5

banana

2

orange

2

What if we want to know the total dollar amounts? Then we use another function SUM(cost) AS total_cost.
SELECT fruit_type, sum(cost) AS total_cost
FROM fruit
GROUP BY fruit_type;
And we'd get …
fruit_type

total_cost

apple

$4.30

banana

$0.60

orange

$1.70

ALERT ALERT!
Watch out for these pitfalls.

 Don't try to put extra stuff in your SELECT statement that's not in the GROUP BY clause. If you bring a


column into the SELECT clause you MUST use it in the GROUP BY clause. But you do not put functions
like count(*) and sum(amount) in the GROUP BY clause.
Watch out for things with the same name (e.g. Arlington County, Tex. and Arlington County, Va.)
Make sure you use count(*) and not count(something else). NULL fields can mess up a good count query.

About today's data:
Database name: dams / Table name: dams
Some key fields:
 NIDID – the ID for each dam
 year_comp – the year the dam was built
 NPDP_Hazard – hazard category based on potential hazard if dam fails
 NID_Storage – storage area of the dam
 And a few obvious fields like dam name, state, and county
