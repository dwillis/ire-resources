TEN THINGS TO LOOK FOR NEXT MONTH
July 15: Midyear campaign finance filings
1.) Largest contributors. Fifty employees of a company, all giving the maximum $4,800
for the primary and general election, can add more than $200,000 to the campaign's
coffers.
2.) Political action committee money. PAC donations closely track an incumbent's
committee assignments. What issues is the lawmaker concerned with and who is
giving?
3.) Opponents' fundraising. If the challenger isn't raising any money, it is a sign that the
incumbent is not in any great danger, despite any spin from party consultants.
4.) Spending. What is the money being used for, not only advertisements and direct
mail but also whether it's going to the babysitter, haircuts, the new car, parking tickets or
trips.
5.) PAC donations. Some PACs file twice a year, and this will be the first peek at who
they're supporting., With the recession, are PAC donations down this year from two
years ago?
July 20: Midyear lobbying filings
1.) New registrations. Which interest groups are hiring new lobbyists to lobby on which
issues.
2.) Check to see if industries in trouble -- auto, banking -- are continuing to spend
millions on lobbying.
3.) Issues in the news. With climate change and health care atop Congress' agenda, are
interest groups beefing up their lobbying on those issues?
4.) For the first time, lobbyists must disclose when they have raised $16,000 or more for
a particular candidate. These reports are filed with the Federal Election Commission.
5.) Revolving door. What clients are former lawmakers lobbying for? While newly retired
lawmakers cannot register to lobby, their new firms can register to represent clients that
the former lawmaker used to oversee while in Congress.
