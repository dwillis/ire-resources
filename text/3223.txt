NICAR - Excel / Access User Defined Functions

Our goal is not to teach VBA programming, just to show you the possibilities. Hopefully, you may want to get further into simple
VBA programming or, by understanding what it can do, perhaps you can request a techie to help with your special problems.
Visual Basic for Applications.
Based on the original Basic programming language from the early 70’s, this version is built in to all Microsoft Office products and is
similar to Visual Basic version 6.0. Each product like Excel has special capabilities in VBA for accessing and manipulating its specific
“objects” such as cells and ranges of cells. (Called the Object Model).
Excel
Functions are used by adding a formula in a cell
using the function name:
=FunctionName(Argument1, Argument2…)
Arguments are info passed into the function such
as a cell’s contents, codes or other values
VBA functions (generically called “Procedures”)
may also be operated from buttons or other
objects placed on a work sheet. However we
shall just deal with ones called as cell Formulas.
“A user defined function called by a formula in
a worksheet cell cannot change the
environment of Microsoft Excel.” Generally,
this means that a function can return a calculated
value to the present field only.

Creating User Defined Functions
Menu: Tools, Macro, Visual Basic Editor (or
AltF11)
Menu: View, Project Explorer
Menu: Insert Module (accessible from all worksheets)
Menu: Insert, Procedure, Function, Name
Use Function symbol fx to see All Functions –and select User Defined

CombineName(Cell1,Cell2)
GetFirstName(Cell1)
GetLastName(Cell1)
StripNonAlphaChars(Cell1,Code)
ForceDate(Cell)
ExtractDate(Cell)
ExtractDelim(Cell,DelimChar,Num)
ForceDate(ExtractDelim(Cell,DelimChar,Num))
ExtractAfter(Cell, Code, SearchString, StartPos, MaxLength)

Access
In Access, functions maybe called from query columns.
Also, because Access is “Event driven”, functions may be called
from events in forms or reports. So, a function could be triggered
after entering data in a field.
