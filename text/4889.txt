Security Researchers
Commonalities between journalists and security researchers (aka
technologists, computer scientists, infosec specialists, hackers):
- Insatiable curiosity for how the world works
- Understanding of value of information (both accessing it and
protecting it)
- Drive for ﬁnding and exposing the ﬂaws in a system
- Disdain for government and businesses who put people at risk
- Want to see the world become a better place*
- Increasing interest in FOIA
* In some cases.

Why security researchers?
- Often uncover huge stories, but don’t realize
the news or public policy implications
- Assist in assuring technical accuracy of
reporting
- Identify new investigative leads
- Lift the hood on emerging technology
- Analyze technical implication of legislation
and policy

Case Study: ComputerCOP “Internet Safety” Software

When Reporters Don’t Contact Security Researchers

IRE - June 2016

Well, actually….
ComputerCOP exposes
users through a keylogger
and broadcasts what’s typed
unencrypted.
And it’s a nationwide scam,
involving potential fraud and
corruption.

Case Study: Automated License Plate Readers

IRE - June 2016

When Computer Researchers Don’t Work
With Journalists
Hackers found that “red
light cameras” were
exposed on the Internet.
But their research papers
never really reached
anyone outside the
infosec community.
Also, they weren’t red
light cameras.

Police License Plate Readers in Louisiana
By collaborating,
we were able to
show these were
mass surveillance
systems and who
they belonged to.
Results: cameras
were ﬁxed and
the vulnerabilities
inﬂuenced
legislation

The Other Person: Your Lawyer
Beware the Computer Fraud & Abuse Act.
Things can get treacherous pretty quickly,
so remember to seek legal advice when
probing.
