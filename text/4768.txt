What is an API?

What is an API?
APIs are an easy way for computers, programs and developers
to talk to each other.
You ask a question of an API using a url and you get a very
structured response that is easy for a computer to understand.

API URL components
The web addressgets your question routed to the right server
The endpointis the category of thing you are interested in
The parametersask the question about the thing you are interested in

Web address
The base URL directs your question to a web address

https://api.open.fec.gov/v1/candidates?state=MD&api_key=NICAR16

Version number
Versions make it easier for users to transitions when an API changes
https://api.open.fec.gov/v1/candidates?state=MD&api_key=NICAR16

Endpoint
The endpoint describes the category you are looking at.
Look at an API’s documentation to see what kind of methods are available.
https://api.open.fec.gov/v1/candidates?state=MD&api_key=NICAR16

Parameters
The parameters come after a “?” and ask the question

Overlap with FEC API
Timeliness
Electronic filing data
Calculated fields

https://propublica.github.io/campaign-finance-api-docs/

Compared to FEC API
● Both use bulk (FTP) data for committee, candidate info.
● Both have itemized transactions, but differ on sources.
● ProPublica updated with bulk data daily & every 15 minutes
for filings.

Timeliness Factor
● New electronic filings every 15 minutes
● Process updates summary info based on electronic filings
● Quick access to itemized transactions, but data isn’t
enhanced like FTP data is.

Electronic Filing Data in API
● Details about filings, including summary JSON
● 48-hour reports of late contributions
● 24-hour reports of independent expenditures

Electronic Filing Data NOT in API
● Itemized contributions (Schedule A)
● Itemized expenditures (Schedule B)
● Debt and loan transactions (coming soon)

Calculated Fields & Subsets
