Tracking officerinvolved shootings
What is missing from national data

National data sources
Three primary sources, each with some flaws:
●FBI’s UCR Data (Supplemental Homicide
Report)
●Center for Disease Control’s CDC’s National
Vital Statistics System for “legal intervention”
●Bureau of Justice Statistics (DOJ) Death in
Custody Reporting Program.

What our reporting found
●550 incidents missing in six-year period from
105 largest departments
●~ 45% of all incidents were missing from the
the FBI’s data.
●Several large states are missing, including
N.Y., Fla., Ill. (aside from Chicago and
Rockland)

What’s in the data?
CDC’s National Vital Statistics System
●Based on death certificates
●Not broken down by agency
●Isn’t limited to just officer-involved shootings,
includes things like state-sanctioned executions
that need to be filtered out

What’s in the data?
Bureau of Justice Statistics Death in
Custody Reporting
●Started in 2003 to try to track all deaths of
suspects while in police custody, regardless of
the cause.
●Need to filter by “arrest-related” deaths

What’s in the data?
FBI’s UCR Data
●Not every agency turns in the Supplemental
Homicide Report
●Several states, agencies missing for one or
more years
●Only source that includes agency-level
information, but how is that tracked?

Reporters, go to the source

“You let one
go, you gotta
write. ”

Better data tomorrow?
●New York said it will start reporting to the FBI
again. Florida is “reviewing the problem.”
●The Death in Custody Reporting Act of 2013
passed in Dec. supposed to improve fed stats
●The Washington Post, The Guardian are
tracking incidents this year. Also, Fatal
Encounters has been for years.
