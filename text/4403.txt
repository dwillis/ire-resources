Dirty Tricks in the Land of Generic Drugs

A financial weekly
founded in 1921…

…by the owner of The Wall Street Journal:
a gentleman by the name of Clarence Barron.

Clarence Barron helped
expose the swindler
Charles Ponzi in 1920

We warned readers against
Bernie Madoff in 2001,
seven years before he turned
himself in.

Alan Abelson
started writing for
Barron’s in 1956,
the year I was
born

Prof. Abe Briloff

Why we’re here

Why Reproducible Research ?
Credibility -- Evidence for your story’s truth.
Sharing -- Give other groups a head start.
Quality -- Reinforces good work practices,
e.g. Do It Once, commenting, version control,
no cutting & pasting.

Teamwork – Easier collaboration,
with others and your future self.

Reproducing vs. Replicating

Requirements for Reproducibility
1. Include the original unmodified data sources.
2. If raw data is transformed,
preserve that transformation in scripts.
3. Document everything you do
using # comments.
4. Produce a "human digestible" artifact
(.html, .pdf etc.).

A Good Book

Requirements for Preplicability
(continued)
5. Confidentiality: compartmentalize sources
you’re “confronting” from each other’s data.
6. Free, open source (R, iPython notebook,
PC/Mac)
7. Plain text: it’s always in style.
8. Use a stable, vanilla software environment:
to ensure needed software remains
available.
