These tips are gleaned from my investigation of a state-funded community residential
program for developmentally disabled adults who are in trouble with the law. The
restrictive program put vulnerable adults in the 24-hour care of private companies while
providing little state oversight. The result was rampant abuse and neglect of the clients
who didn’t have the right to appeal placement in the program – or any way to get out.

1. GETTING STARTED:
• Look for publicly funded programs that include the volatile mix of vulnerable
clients (whether developmentally disabled, elderly, foster kids), private service
providers (especially for-profts) and minimal state scrutiny
• Background yourself and learn how the program operates by talking to
former/current employees of companies, state officials and advocacy groups.
Look at state policies/regulations governing program, including minimum staff
requirements, etc.
• Submit exploratory public disclosure requests for: incident reports to state; state
audits of companies; all complaints about program; state contracts with
companies and company financial reports to state
• Discuss proposed redactions with state officials early in the process to avoid
surprises later on. Ask state to give you a sample of redacted incident report so
you can challenge unnecessary redactions up front. Contact your attorney if
necessary.
• Be willing to narrow scope of public disclosure to speed up process/save money
when dealing with large volume of documents e.g. get first page of incident report
to screen them, then ask for full reports of specific incidents
• Keep in mind that the federal HIPAA allows the redaction of almost all
identifying information of clients in many state programs -- including the names
of those who have died. Details which must be released are the year of birth and
the first 3 digits of zip code when more than 20,000 people live in that area
2. DOCUMENT DIVING:
• Build an Excel file to track incident reports, including sorting by company,
location, date, type of incident (e.g. physical assault, neglect etc.), staff name,
police involvement. Use the data to give readers specific information e.g. number
of 911 calls or arrests
• Let the data direct your investigation. Re-frame your focus.
• Documents lead to more documents: follow-up with more public disclosure
requests based on your findings

•

When dealing with unresponsive state officials, copy your e-mail public
disclosure requests to their bosses to get action
• Ask for reports/e-mails/agreements between state officials and federal officials
who authorize funding for state programs
3. IDENTIFYING ANONYMOUS CLIENTS
• Look for clues to clients’ identities in the documents e.g. date of physical assault
and name of company might be enough to track down a police report; or first
name of client who died and date of death might be enough to search obits in local
newspaper
• Search for civil lawsuits filed by names of private companies
• News reports: link redacted incident reports to news stories that may provide
other clues e.g. name of detective, guardian or attorney
• Word-of-mouth: talk to former/current employees, ask advocacy groups to
connect you with families of clients
4. INTERVIEWING CLIENTS & FAMILIES
• Background yourself before contacting families, including reading criminal/civil
court files and guardianship files
• Be sensitive to family members’ concerns about confidentiality. Negotiate how to
identify client while protecting privacy e.g. first name only. Use non-identifying
photos if necessary. Record a digital interview where client can speak without
being identified.
• Polite persistence goes a long way. Check back with reluctant sources as the
investigation proceeds. Share your findings with them
• Be willing to spend time getting to know vulnerable adults before bombarding
them with questions. Go for a walk, out for pizza or play a game
• Get informed consent from the parent/guardian of child or vulnerable adult
5. INTERVIEWING CAREGIVERS
• Contact service providers early in investigation to background yourself and seek
cooperation. Talk to both the managers and frontline staff if possible.
• Use e-mail to bypass the front desk and contact company officials directly. But
don’t agree to e-mail interviews except as a last resort
• Search for civil lawsuits against companies to find out more about how they
operate
• Check for political contributions by company owners/officials to legislators
• Find out whether company officials own properties rented out to clients by
running names through county property records
6. STATE/FEDERAL OVERSIGHT
• Examine how state and federal government monitor clients’ care and private
companies’ spending: How often do they audit companies? Who does the audits?
What about enforcement?
• Ask what rights vulnerable clients have to refuse service or appeal what is offered
to them?
• Always write follow-up stories and stay in touch with sources to monitor what
happens after the series runs. Reforms are more likely when the newspaper shows
an ongoing commitment to an issue.
