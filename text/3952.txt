Investigating a GIANT shale
boom
(at a small or mid sized daily)
An examination of oil waste spills

Eagle Ford Shale and C-T
coverage area

San Antonio

2007

2012

Results
• County officials
allocated additional
resources to
environmental crimes
• Other counties in the
Eagle Ford Shale,
such as Frio County,
took note and
established their own
oil field waste policing

• Hundreds fined and
taken to court
• Eco Mud waste
facility cleaned up its
act
• Other facilities fined
or shut down after
receiving new
scrutiny.

With a small staff and a vast topic
(that everyone else in the world is
covering), what can you do?
• Teamwork the low-hanging fruit
• Find stories that can be explained in terms
of real people from the communities you
serve.

• Read the Beeville Bee Picayune???

Circumvent the big, faceless
agency
• Use their data, but don’t expect useful interviews or
timely responses.
• Useful interviews and local impact come from relying on
local deputies, angry residents, rural school
superintendent, environmental educator
• Agency data – see tipsheet

• Read the law and agency rules (administrative code)

To get the permit, a hauler
is supposed to certify that
the truck trailer is leak-free;
Ockels said this measure is
essentially an honor system
because no authority ever
checks the trucks for leaks
before the permit is issued.

Certified, “leak-free” trailer

Hang out with the local guys…

Other energy boom investigations
(besides the environment)
• Sexually transmitted diseases, health access
and other health stories

roads, but what about electricity? water?)
