Source: Christine Wen ~ chris@goodjobsfirst.org or 202-232-1616 ext. 6
In 2015, the Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB) issued a new
accounting rule (Statement 77) that requires about 50,000 local and state
government bodies (those that adhere to GAAP accounting rules) to report for the
first time how much revenue they lose annually to economic development tax
abatement programs.
Subsidy Tracker 2: A Database of State/Local Tax Abatement Costs
Good Jobs First is gathering this new data in our Subsidy Tracker 2 database:
https://www.goodjobsfirst.org/subsidy-tracker-2#/.
Subsidy Tracker 2 is indexed by governmental body and then by fiscal year. (Our
original Subsidy Tracker database is primarily organized by recipient company
names and provides data in some cases going back many years.)
To date, Subsidy Tracker 2 has captured data from more than 10,000 state and local
Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports (CAFRs), including abatement losses
totaling $28.1 billion. However, about 40 percent of jurisdictions do not appear to
have adopted GASB 77, making no mention of the new rule and disclosing no
abatements.

First-Ever Disclosures of Revenues Lost by School Districts
An Example of How GASB 77 Data Can Be Used
The New Math on School Finance (December, 2018) uses GASB 77 data to assess the
cost of tax abatements to public education. Public schools across the country lost at
least $1 .8 billion in FY 2017 to economic development tax incentives granted to
corporations. School districts in New York and South Carolina reported over $300
million in forgone tax revenue. Louisiana, Ohio, and Oregon also suffered heavy
losses, as revealed by the new disclosure rule. Read the full report here:
