Airline maintenance and safety
Driving CAR on the transportation beat. NICAR 2004 National Conference - Cincinnati

Soon after a heavily loaded U.S. Airways Express Flight 5481 crashed in Charlotte shortly after
takeoff, airline maintenance appeared as a likely cause.
A mechanic at a small West Virginia repair station had recently adjusted the plane’s elevator
control cables, a job he had never done on a Beech 1900D. His instructor was also his inspector. He and
other mechanics worked nights; the manager usually worked days. And the FAA officer in charge of
monitoring the site had visited only once since mechanics began working there.
The Charlotte Observer set out to find how the Jan. 8, 2003, crash that killed all 21 aboard fit with
industry trends. A four part series Dec. 7-10 reported that airlines are spending less to maintain their planes.
Mechanics are checking them less often. Federal oversight is stretched thin. And maintenance is
increasingly a factor in fatal crashes.
The Observer found that since 1994, maintenance problems have contributed to 42% of fatal
airline accidents in the U.S., up from 16% the previous decade. Faulty maintenance contributed to three of
the past five fatal airline crashes in the U.S., and likely played a role in a fourth, now under investigation.
Airlines have invested millions to fix other serious problems such as pilot error, and overall,
crashes are declining.. But faulty maintenance, an equally preventable problem, has never received the
attention it deserves, experts told the newspaper. Sources of data for the series included:
NTSB accidents. This relational database, available for download or online query from NTSB,
includes facts about crashes, the planes involved, events and contributing factors. It was the primary source
for statements about accident trends. We started with a list of U.S. fatal air carrier accidents since 1994 in
which the aircraft was substantially damaged or destroyed. An intranet application allowed reporters to
browse the list, filter it with a SQL Where statement, follow a link to investigative reports, as well as add
and edit crash entries..
The air accident data is referred to as ADMSPUB,. Data and documentation can be downloaded at
http://www.ntsb.gov/avdata/. The documentation is key to understanding and using the relationships among
accidents, aircraft, people, events and contributing factors. Staff in the NTSB Public Inquiries branch
answered almost all data questions.
PTRS inspections. The FAA’s Program Tracking and Reporting Subsystem manages information
about FAA inspections of contract repair stations and nonmajor airlines, and a portion of inspections of the
nation’s major carriers. It was sought in a FOIA request. We focused on closed, completed airworthiness
and avionics inspections from 2000 to mid 2003. An inspection was considered to have an unfavorable
result if the inspector reported that it led to an enforcement investigation or required follow-up action.
Valuable information about PTRS can be gleaned from watchdog reports from agencies like the
General Accounting Office reports. For example, in 1998 the GAO reported that PTRS records understate
the incidence of problems and violations. Key questions about PTRS were answered by interviewing
inspectors and others in the FAA who use the system and its data.
EIS. The Enforcement Information System data is the FAA’s record of its actions against people
and organizations in aviation. It’s in the NICAR data library
TranStats. This online service by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics provides data on airline
spending, including maintenance spending, departures and passengers..It’s at http://www.transtats.bts.gov/
Service Difficulty Reports. These aviation problem reports have been criticized because of
inconsistent reporting and because problems can be as minor as a bad light bulb. We focused on reports
rated highest for the threat posed to safety. Online query is available.
Several other databases were used in background,. including FAA Accidents and Incidents
Database and lists of contract repair stations. These, AIDS queries, SDR queries and other resources are
available from the Aviation Data Systems (AFS-620) web page at http://afs600.faa.gov/AFS620.htm.
