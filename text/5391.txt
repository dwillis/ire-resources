Keep a data diary or a document with all your queries, so you can reproduce your work
Make a copy of all original documents before making any changes to them
Overestimate the amount of time it’ll take to check over your work
Check for totals at the bottom of file and extra characters hidden in cells
Consult with experts and researchers for gaps in your data/analysis
Check for nulls, missing values. Know what these mean.
Are there spelling issues? Check for these and other data smells
Dates: Are they month-day-year or day-month-year?
Row counts: did you count the header row by accident? Always freeze your panes!
Does something really stand out? Is it a real outlier or could there be a hidden mistake?
Talk out loud to someone, showing each step you took, explaining what you did and why
If you can have a researcher or expert take a look, have them poke holes in your
analysis and check your work
