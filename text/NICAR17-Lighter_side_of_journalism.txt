inform but to entertain

In a more innocent time…

Halloween Candy Index
• We wanted to know the
best trick-or-treat areas
• A mix of different

homes, population
density, median income,
% children

• GEOJSON shapefiles added to Mapbox GL
• Wrote out a bullet-point style story to
highlight our findings
