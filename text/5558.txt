From conceiving the investigative story idea to choosing the right story format, here’s some of
our best advice on how to infuse your approach with an investigative mindset.

Make good choices
●
●

●

Understand your resources, strengths, limitations. Be thoughtful about where you will
invest a significant amount of your energy and the resources of your news organization.
Seek to see how small issues are indications of larger systemic problems. Beat stories,
field observations give investigative works an immediacy that projects hatched from the
corner office or ivory tower can lack.
Steer away from the ‘systems’ story to the people who need to be held accountable. It’s
people who make decisions, or turn a blind eye, or are harmed. It’s why we care. And it
is how we enable change. Then remember to step back and see them in the context of
the bigger scheme.

Choose the right frame
●

●
●

Think of investigative stories as several specific questions you are trying to answer. Be
able to clearly articulate what they are. Example: Why are serious workplace injuries at
Tesla 80 percent above industry average?
Don’t try to tell your audience everything about the topic. Focus on slices of the story that
are new, that expose actual harm to real people and can generate impact.
Don’t wait until you’ve gathered every scrap of record and analyzed all of your data to
start talking to real people, Those conversations will inform your ongoing reporting.

Is this story investigative?
●

●
●

IRE defines investigative journalism as “reporting, through one’s own initiative and work
product, of matters of importance to readers, viewers or listeners. In many cases, the
subjects of the reporting wish the matters under scrutiny to remain undisclosed.”
Substantially the product of the reporter’s own initiative and effort
Uncovers facts that some official or agency may have tried to keep from public scrutiny.

●

Focuses on issues of public importance to the readers, viewers or listeners.

●

Shows enterprise and excellence in the documentation, data, storytelling, production,
online presentation, and reader or viewer involvement where appropriate
Results & impact

●

Truth test on the beat
●
●

●
●
●
●

Trust nothing and no one (including your own assumptions)
Eat raw: drill down to understand how records and information is gathered, where, by
whom, and how it is stored. Doing so will build your understanding, your confidence,
expose patterns of deception, and allow for authoritative story telling that readers will
know to trust.
Start by simple data collection and calculate your own trends.
Look to see where those trends are pointing forward and steer your reporting there.
Look for inception points, and junctures, and also focus there.
Develop expertise on your beat beyond the beat experts.

Make FOIA part of your routine
●
●
●

●
●

Submit FOIAs to inform your reporting on long-term projects.
But also on quick turns even if you know the results won’t come until later.
FOIAs are an essential part of a regular cycle of accountability reporting: payrolls,
lawsuit settlements, emails, calendars, purchase orders and contracts can all indicate
hidden agendas and new policies. Do your homework!
Have a clear and consistent system for following up and pressing agencies for release.
Don’t ever give up on a FOIA because the story value seems to have declined. You’re
just training the agency to wait you out. Be (politely) relentless.

Understand the full power of FOIA/PRA (interview your records)
●
●
●
●

Go beyond the ‘gotcha’ and the smoking gun.
Let it lead you to people: Map the network, find the decision makers and the internal
watchdogs, skeptics.
Build timelines and trace back to the source.
Mine for email addresses, phone numbers, addresses. Have a good OCR reader and
process all FOIA dumps. Frequent reading “rooms” and observe other FOIAs.

Harness the power of the rolling investigation
●

Have a clear path for where you are headed. But don’t wait until you’ve gathered every
scrap to publish.

●

If you had to write it today, what would you say?
Tell your readers and listeners what you don’t know.
Tell your readers and listeners what documents you really want but don’t have
Establish multiple, simple and secure ways for people to communicate with you.
Ask for a stint on the projects team, partner up with a veteran projects reporter. FIND
THE RIGHT EDITOR! Build excitement. Brainstorm with them - what are we missing?
