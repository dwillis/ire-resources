Hints for Success:
 Be flexible: Collaboration = compromise
 Come up with idea together and work together from beginning.
Build relationships between reporters/producers; not just editors/managers.
 Learn something about your partner’s craft that you don't use in your own.
 Be open and transparent about deadlines and plans from the start. This includes rollout. (Will
you air/publish at the same time or stagger release with different approaches to the story?)
 Be patient and willing to take a long time (longer than you may be used to).
 Do interviews and newsgathering together – and game plan/practice beforehand if necessary.
 Manage expectations across newsrooms; by sharing often you build trust.
 Get bosses involved early – including legal teams, if appropriate. And discuss how your legal
processes/script approval works. An abundance of sharing at this stage is a good thing.
 Dividing and Conquering worked well/each person had specific tasks.
 Frequent conference calls are critical; have you partner on speed dial!
Establish a place where you share video and documents easily (i.e., password-protected FTP
site, Drop Box, etc.)
 Build on strength of each other by allowing each partner to do what it is they do best.
 Avoid any confusion at the finish line. Draw a clear picture of what the finished product will
look like for BOTH organizations.
Have a post-mortem. There will inevitably be things that didn’t work; learn from them
immediately so you know what to do differently next time.
Go and have a beer afterward!

Challenges to Be Aware of Ahead of Time:


DIFFERENT NEWSROOMS = DIFFERENT CULTURES. ALL SHOPS WORK AT
DIFFERENT SPEEDS AND HAVE DIFFERENT PRIORITIES. THESE MUST BE
ACCOUNTED FOR.



EMBRACE THE DIFFERENCES AND BUILD OFF ONE ANOTHER’S STRENGTHS
SO AS TO ENHANCE, NOT HINDER, THE END PRODUCT.



ESTABLISHING TRUST ISN’T EASY – START AT THE GROUND LEVEL WITH
“BOOTS ON THE GROUND REPORTERS” – TRUST GROWS FROM THERE.



DO NOT MAKE PROMISES EXPECTING A PARTNER TO DELIVER. THIS IS
ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT WHEN DEALING WITH YOUR SOURCES AND
EXPECTATIONS OF A PROJECT ACROSS PLATFORMS.



RECOGNIZE THAT YOU DON’T HAVE EDITORIAL CONTROL OVER A
PARTNER, YOUR PARTNER DOES.



THINK OF YOUR NEWS GATHERING EXPERIENCE AS A GARDEN FROM
WHICH EACH COLLABORTOR CAN HARVEST WHICH BEST FITS HIS/HER
NEEDS.



BE AWARE NOT ALL STORIES IN A MULTI-PLAYER COLLABORATION WILL
LOOK THE SAME ON EVEN TAKE THE SAME ANGLE. A MULTI-FACETED
APPROACH MAKES THE MATERIAL RICHER.



DIFFERENT DEMANDS MEAN DIFFERENT EXPECTATIONS IN THE
NEWSGATHERING PROCESS (GATHERING VIDEO VS GATHERING PRINT
INTERVIEWS IS VASTLY DIFFERENT)



ESTABLISH A COMMON VIDEO FORMAT TO FACILITATE SHARING. WE’RE
NOT ALL HD IN THE FIELD.



BE AWARE OF SCREEN DIRECTION. IF YOU NEED ANOTHER STATION TO
SHOOT SOUND FOR YOU, TELL THEM WHICH WAY TO FACE THE SUBJECT.
IF YOU ARE THE SHOOTER, ASK.



NO MIC FLAGS!

Successful Projects
Often Include Some of the Following:
 MULTIPLE PLATFORMS TO REACH WIDEST POSSIBLE AUDIENCE
 DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO THE SAME INFORMATION
 HEAVY LIFTING THAT’S ACCOMPLISHED BY ASSIGNING TASKS TO DIFFERENT
TEAMS; COLLABORATIONS = MORE HANDS ON DECK
 COMPLIMENTARY SKILL SETS AND SMART ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES
