4 Quick Tips
from Deb Nelson
Associate Professor of Investigative Journalism
Philip Merrill College of Journalism, University of Maryland

1. Build a strong supporting curriculum
for investigative reporting
One class isn’t enough.

Dilemma
School is for education, right?
Stretching, experimentation, learning from mistakes.
At the same time, there’s increasing pressure —funders,
schools, partners -- to produce professional content.
How do we make room in our curriculum to do both?*
*and not bust the accreditation limits on journalism credits

- To help students keep track of where they got their information
