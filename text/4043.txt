The Data-Driven Story
•

Data/story research
• Getting the data
• Interviewing the data
• The methodology
• The analysis
• The pitch

Research
•

IRE Resource Center: tips sheets and
previous stories
• Chat with experts in your own newsroom
• Nexis
• Academic/government studies
• OIG, GAO reports

Getting the data
•

NICAR data library
• Check the agency Website
• Request from agency
• Create data

Getting the data from an agency
•

Know the law
• Do you homework
• Know what the appropriate costs should be
• Make your request clear
• Get to know Leon
• Follow up on your request

When there is no data
•

Use your sources
• Sampling
• Building data from documents
• Physical surveys
• Testing
• Questionnaires, polls and surveys

Interview the data
•

Assume there are problems in the data

Interview the data
•

Assume there are problems in the data
• How many records should you have? Are there
other counts to check: counties, states, etc…

Interview the data
•

Assume there are problems in the data
• How many records should you have? Are there
other counts to check: counties, states, etc…
• Double-check totals or counts against summary
reports
• Check for duplicates in multiple ways
• Consistency-check all fields

Interview the data
•

Internal consistency checks

Interview the data
•

Make sure you understand which fields to look
at – don’t assume you know.

Interview the data
•

Internal consistency checks
• Check the ranges of fields.
• Check for missing data or blank fields. Are they
real values, or did something happen with an
import or append query?

• Do you know what every field in the database
means? Are there special codes?

• Do you know what every field in the database
means? Are there special codes?
• Have there been changes over time that would
create problems?

Truck accidents by year and agency

Beyond the data
•

Go physically look at the data

The Methodology
Don’t recreate the wheel
• Use the IRE resource center and your experts
• Keep notes as you interview and analyze your
data
• Use a standard naming convention for files and
tables (I wouldn’t recommend “final”)
• Are there certain records that should be
excluded because of problems?
•

The Methodology
•

Borrow / steal from social scientists and other
analysts
• Review what they’ve already done and then
interview them
• Develop a hypothesis to test

“Worst” bridges in Texas

List of total bridges in 250 counties

Dallas County bridges

Bridges with at least 10K daily traffic (163 counties)

Analysis of Variance
• a collection of statistical models
used to analyze the differences
between group means and their
associated procedures (such as
"variation" among and between
groups).

The Pitch
•

Explain your findings in one or two sentences.
• Provide an outline with a summary of your
findings
• Provide a timeline/potential costs
• Ideas for possible graphics, interactives or
photos
