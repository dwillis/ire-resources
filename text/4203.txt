1. Sit in the courtroom and watch a civil commitment trial, the personality of an expert
really comes out on the stand and judges will give their opinions of them.
2. Review the psychological evaluations of sex offenders and the recidivism tools and
science they use.
3. Follow the money trail, like detailed budgets and payment systems for experts and
attorneys.
4. Request records from different public agencies including state and local governments
and the courts.
5. Build databases to track payments to experts and lawyers to determine how much money
they made on sexual predator cases.
6. Look at the history of the expert, how they have testified in the past and their
credentials.
7. Be ready to fight for records and get buy-in from your editor to challenge denials of
records.
8. Get inside the facility where sex offenders live, file records requests for any audits,
internal investigations and discipline records of employees.
9. Find the human side to the story by speaking to the sex offenders, victims and families
affected by laws like civil commitment.
10. Track sex offenders who must show up weekly or monthly to the sheriff’s office or
courthouse claiming they are homeless when in fact some are skirting the registration laws.
