No technical skills are needed for this workshop, though a little bit of comfort with math and
some perseverance will help. You can probably do more with the data if you have some skills in
data fusion or have taken other data workshops.
Please comment here if you have something specific you’d like me to discuss in the workshop.
Or if you have a questions after the workshop. I’ll get notifications about comments.
Here’s what you need to know about the scale of our immigration system:
There are some 320 million people in the US. 43 million of them were born abroad. About 11
million people are undocumented and over 5.1 million children have one or more undocumented
parent. ​2.3 million people regularly check in with immigration agents​. 860,000 people have
applied for temporary legal status because they are undocumented but were brought to the US
as children. Over 500,000 people are waiting for their cases to be heard in immigration courts.
Some 270,000 people in the US came as refugees. On any given day, about 40,000 people are
in immigration detention.
The numbers surrounding immigration can often be daunting and, sometimes, hard to track
down. In this session, we’ll go through some of the most useful data sets available — and talk
about some of the data that’s a bit tougher to find. We’ll talk about how to use that data to get
leads on local and national stories — and what to do when the government is not providing data
about its immigration actions.
(I wrote much of this chunk of numbers in part for a project at Global Nation. ​Check it out​!)

These numbers came from a lot of places and many of them were hard won, sometimes by
journalists but mostly by attorneys trying to represent their clients, and open government
advocates.
Data about immigration has never been easy. It’s not centralized. And, in our immigration
system, there aren’t the checks and public records of the criminal justice system. Many of the
battles that folks have won in the Obama administration, ​are now being fought a second time in
the Trump administration​. The Trump administration is stripping ICE of its reporting capacity,
and replacing any transparency they did have with at best incomplete reports, and at worst,
reports that are full of errors​ or are misleading.
(​Here’s a question I asked the Trump administration as part of a project we did at PRI in the first
100 days of his presidency​.)
For today’s session, I want us to dive into a different set of numbers: How many
immigrants in the US are on temporary programs, not tourist or business visas and not
green cards?
Here’s an experiment: List all the temporary permissions to stay in the US you can think of.
Prosecutorial discretion
Humanitarian Parole
TPS
DACA
Asylum seeker
Stay of deportation/removal
Administrative parole
Administrative closure
Cancellation of Removal
Deferred Enforced Departure
Central American Minors program
Let me explain: ​For people who might request asylum, there are several ways to get a
temporary status.

Let’s try that again:

So what are all these people doing? Where are they going?

March 19:​ Migration Policy Institute does amazing, non-partisan work. ​They’ll livestream a
session about immigration data and release what promises to be an essential guide.
