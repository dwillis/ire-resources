Magic!
Data, Documents, Dazzle.

Why data and documents
● Can give your stories credibility
● Uncover basic information: it adds context and can boost breaking
news coverage
● Helps test whether promises are being kept and standards are
being met
● Supports enterprise reporting — the stories you choose to do that
no one else is
● Tell your stories online in a more compelling way
● Move beyond “what” and concentrate on “why”

The data and documents “State of Mind”
●

Data is paper records in electronic form. If
you’re filling out a piece of paper for the
government, it’s probably part of a
database.

●

Reconnoiter the bureaucratic underbelly.
Talk to the clerks and IT help-desk.
○

Find out record name/number, agency
and person who has it.

The Google
» First stop for information based on keywords

It’s OK to do something small
Denver Post example of story about mayor
“On his statement, Hancock's staff filed a four-page spreadsheet detailing gifts that included more than $30,000 worth of tickets
to Broncos, Rockies and Nuggets games — sometimes donated to charity — and tickets to the 2014 Super Bowl.” - Denver Post

Sometimes it’s as easy as asking the extra
question
○ How do you know that?
○ How are those records kept? Who tracks that?
○ Can you send me the report/data?

Know your rights! (to data and documents)
Assume that everything is open to public inspection. If an agency says no, make
them cite the law that says the record is closed.
Assume it’s free.
Read the law:
CORA- Colorado Open Record Act and CCJRA - Colorado Criminal Justice
Records Act
- 24-72-201 to 24-72-309, C.R.S.

I said, “How is this not a public record?”
← Then they said...

Negotiating
Common denial reasons:
●
●
●
●
●

Not our policy (But what does the law say?)
Silence (Keep calling, or work up the chain of command)
Request was overly broad (Work on ways to narrow the request)
“We don’t track that it in a database” and “don’t have to create a record”
Our data can’t be exported (Call the software company)

What to do when you’re staring down a spreadsheet
●

Make a master copy and hide it

●

Interview it like any other (human source)

●

Write out your questions
○

●

Consider asking questions like how many, most frequent, outliers, counting, sorting, average
or deviation from norm, increase or decrease

Break your questions into pieces and tackle each step.
“Which city agency has gotten the biggest funding increase this year?”
#3: Sort data
highest to
lowest

#2: Percent
increase = (New old)/Old * 100

#1: Filter by year

Tools you’ll need
At least:
Excel: learn how to sort, filter, make pivot tables
More advanced:
Access or MySQL: joining tables, grouping

“Cleaning” data
●

Structuring, fixing, correcting
Use filters to see “dirty” data

“William Swadley was convicted in Dane County Circuit Court in 1990 of sexually assaulting
a 9-year-old girl and attempted sexual assault of an 11-year-old girl, and again in 1992 for
enticement of a 12-year-old girl. The latter was committed while Swadley was in a
wheelchair.” - WCIJ

Use records retention schedules to find out what an agency keeps
Ask for:
Budgets, Audits (performance, financial), Employee information (salaries, hire
dates, titles, departments, directory, org charts), Annual reports, CAFRs
(Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports), Vendors, Officials’ calendars, Travel

You can also request a list of major information systems
maintained by the agency
Something in chart or graph format can have underlying data—request it
Remember: Any time there’s interaction with the government, information
becomes public
