CMS:
Content
Management
System

What newsrooms use to
manage content on their
websites
examples: Wordpress, Drupal

AWS:
Amazon
Web
Services

You can pay Amazon to host
your website and/or your
data so that you don’t have
to.

OpSec:
Operational
Security

Ways to protect information:
for journalists, protect your
sources’ identities, your
communications with your
sources, and the information
they give to you.

Hash

Security terms.

PGP Key

Hash is basically encrypted text, that
with the right program becomes
readable text

Signal

PGP, “pretty good encryption”, gives
you a person key so that you can sign,
encrypt, and decrypt emails, as for
example.
Signal allows you to make secure,
encrypted phone calls and send
messages.

Command
Line

Not as scary as you think.
Access your computer without the use
of the “graphical user interface.” No
pointing and clicking, just code.
Macs and PCs have their own flavors
of command line commands.
Often used when running code; there
are also lots of tools that help you
clean, parse, and analyze data quickly.

Machine
Learning

This is basically artificial intelligence:
teaching computers how to do their
own thinking and processing so that
we don’t have to explicitly tell them
what to do.
Examples: Siri, Netflix
recommendations, Spotify
recommendations and playlists, the
traffic estimates on Google Maps
Some newsrooms teach computers to
do daily mundane tasks.

Virtual
Reality

Computer generated
experiences that simulate
reality.

Algorithm

Algorithms give computers
to-do lists, setting rules and
processes for a series of “if
this, then that…” scenarios.
Algorithms are used in math,
computer science, and
machine learning.

Scraping

Scraping most often refers to web
scraping, which is teaching a computer
to grab information from a website or
websites in an orderly and systematic
fashion.
Think of it as like teaching a computer
to copy and paste from a website into
a spreadsheet over and over and over
again, so that you don’t have to.
Useful if there’s data on the web that
you can’t get any other way.

HTML
CSS
Javascript & jQuery

Languages that are used to create
websites:
HTML is the language used to write the
basic content of a website, from text to
buttons to borders, etc.
CSS is used to style the content: make
the text blue, the border green, etc.
Javascript is what makes things move,
flash, be interactive.
jQuery is a popular Javascript “library”
that helps folks write Javascript more
quickly.

Python
Ruby

These are scripting languages
that can do all kinds of tasks for
you: scrape websites, parse and
clean data, do analysis.
They can also build apps and
websites.
They are open source, and
constantly being developed and
expanded.

Django
Flask
Rails

These are “web frameworks”
that provide a lot of
pre-written code for you to
create websites and apps, so
that you don’t need to
reinvent the wheel.

R
Hadley Wickham

R is another open source language
that was created for statistics, but
can also do a lot of the things that
Python and Ruby can do. It can
even create maps.
Hadley Wickham is a well-known
developer of fantastic R packages
(parsels of code that do cool
things), and he is here! At NICAR!

GitHub

GitHub is a service that
stores code and
documentation; it allows
users to track changes and it
helps teams collaborate and
work on a single repository of
code.

API:
Application
Programming
Interface

A machine-readable stream
of information. For example:
Twitter has an API for all of
the tweets so that others can
access the data and make
their own third party
programs (Hootesuite,
TweetDeck, etc)

Grunt
Gulp

“Program[s] that helps you preview
and test the HTML, CSS and
Javascript you write, to make sure
everything works and that you’re
writing good code” - Sisi Wei
Honestly I don’t even know.
¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Formats that data can come in:

CSV
XML
KML
JSON
geoJSON

CSV = “comma separated values”, is a
flat text file, very common way to ship
data.
XML = data stored in HTML-like “tags”
KML = XML with geographic
information
JSON = JavaScript Object Notation,
data structured for JavaScript
geoJSON = same as JSON with
geographic information

Tableau

A tool that allows you to
make data visualizations,
such as charts and maps,
without having to do any
coding.

D3

Stands for “Data-Driven
Documents”. I don’t know why.
A JavaScript library for
producing dynamic,
interactive visualizations,
with a high level of control.

GIS:
Geographic
Information
System

GIS is a framework for
analyzing data spatially and
geographically.

Esri
ArcGIS

Esri is the company that
created ArcGIS, arguably the
most commonly used GIS
software among businesses
and academics.
ArcGIS plots and analyzes
spatial data.

QGIS

Open source (and therefore
FREE) GIS software that is an
alternative to ArcGIS.

Mapbox
Mapbox Studio

Mapbox is an open source
platform for maps, with a lot
of useful JavaScript libraries
and a desktop application for
designing maps called
Mapbox Studio.

Fusion
Tables

An application through Google,
which allows you to upload
spreadsheet data and plot that
data on a map using Google Maps
(provided it has geographic
information in it). You can do some
basic visualizations and can
publish the map straight from
Fusion Tables.

geocoding

The process by which you
turn addresses into dots on a
map (this is done seamlessly
by Google when you type an
address into Google Maps,
for example)

shapefile

A common file format for
spatial data that was created
by Esri for ArcGIS but is
compatible with other GIS
programs as well.

SQL:
Structured
Query
Language

The language used to query
relational databases (data
with multiple tables).
SQL (pronounced “sequel”) is
used in many different
database programs.

MySQL
PostgreSQL
SQLite

These are different open
source database managers
used by many newsrooms
(and many outside the
industry as well).

Regex:
Regular
Expressions

Character sequences that allow
you to search for patterns in data
rather than literal characters.
For example, using regex, you can
search for any letter, rather than a
specific letter. Or any character
that is not a particular character.
Often used in various programming
languages; can be used on its own
in text editors.

graph databases
Neo4j

Graph databases store and analyze
information based on the
relationships between entities;
good for network analysis.
Neo4j is a common graph
database program; it was what
powered the International Center
for Investigative Journalism’s
Panama Papers project.

OpenRefine

An open source tool for
cleaning data using
clustering algorithms to look
for like values.
Particularly good for name
cleaning when names are
spelled a lot of different ways
or have slight variations.

DocumentCloud

Open source software that
allows you to upload,
annotate, share, and publish
documents.

OCR:
Optical
Character
Recognition

A process that turns words
locked in images (such as
scanned PDFs) into digital
data that is searchable.
DocumentCloud does this to
all the documents you
upload.
It is not always perfect.

Tabula

Free software that can help
you extract data from PDFs.
The data should be tabular,
and the PDFs, digital.

SPSS
PSPP
Excel

SPSS is software for statistical
analysis; it can handle huge datasets,
complex analyses, and is costly.
PSPP is the open source, free
equivalent, except that it’s not
equivalent in power and speed. But it’s
getting better, as open source software
usually does.
You can also do basic statistical
analysis in Excel.
