Digging Into Public Records
How to make government actually work
FOR YOU!
Norberto Santana Jr.

Know your target
• Are you seeking records from a federal, state
or local agency?

Know the law.
• Each agency is covered by different laws –
FOIA vs. PRA and different procedures.

Know your scope
• Is it time to ask for everything?
• Or is it better to chop up request to allow for
better chances to get something in time for
publication?

Know how records are kept
• Electronic vs. paper
• Understand Records retention policies

Persistence Pays Off
• Ask agencies for a rolling approach to
document discovery

Triangulate
• Ask different agencies for similar documents
as often times different agencies have
different records retention policies.
• Usually the agency that is not the target will
care less about releasing documents

Dealing with Delays
• Staffing
• Offices Closed
• Records in different storage places
• Attorney reviews
• 10-day rule

Dealing with Fees.
• Ask to inspect.
• Narrow scope.
• Write about outrageous fees

Time for Confrontation
– Make the delay the story
– Go to court
– Seek out allies, in government, in agencies,
advocates.

Getting Creative
• File PRAs about your PRA.
• Submit PRAs on other PRAs.
