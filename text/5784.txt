Some industry context
The recession of 2008 severely impacted the journalism industry, particularly
impacting the number of journalists of color. The American Society of News Editors
reported that between 2007 and 2015, the number of non-white journalists in U.S.
newsrooms dropped from 7,400 to 4,200 — roughly the same number as in 1989.
Meanwhile, the U.S. is now about 40 percent comprised of non-white people.
However, the newspaper industry is about 17 percent comprised of people of color.
A number that has largely stagnated in the past two decades, ASNE data reported.
Only about half of newsrooms approached to report diversity numbers by ASNE do,
according to research by Meredith Clark, a journalism professor who is now
overseeing the survey’s administration and data collection. Many outlets asked in
recent years to not have their dismal numbers released, and only 17 percent of
newspapers and digital-only outlets participated in the most recent iteration of the
survey in 2018 — the lowest turnout in many years.
ASNE also found that in 2016 minority employment is at 23 percent for online-only
sites, slightly higher than the 17 percent reported for daily newspapers.

posting in their social networks. H

their communities to help bridge these gaps, not reinforce them.

Making an inclusive hiring process
●

Add language to job posts encouraging people to apply even if they don’t fit the
description precisely. (Applicants from dominant groups are more likely to apply if
they don’t meet all requirements. Making flexibility explicit encourages other
potential applicants to do the same.)

●

Instead of having a single person take on hiring decisions, form a diverse committee
to provide support and perspective to the hiring manager.

●

Give applicants credit for listing membership and leadership in affinity organizations
on their resumes.

How to retain a diverse staff
●

Connect younger journalists of color with mentors. T
​ hese mentors don’t have to
be people of color/LGBTQ, but should have some commonalities with the new
journalist.

●

Participate in programs such as ​Fault Lines​ to explore implicit bias in your
newsroom culture.

●

Encourage them to connect with colleagues outside the newsroom​.
○

Tell them about the J​ ournalists of Color​ slack

○

Encourage them to join professional groups with a support system tied to
their identity
