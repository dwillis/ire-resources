Requesting Public Records
1

What is a public record?
The definition of a public record is very broad.
If it is made or received in connection with the
transaction of official business it is a public
record.
Regardless of the format in which it is made or
received.

Text messages.

2

Records do not need to be
“final.”
The records do not need to be in final form in
order to be public.

If the record is used to perpetuate,
communicate or formalize knowledge related to
public business, whether in final form or not, it
is public.
E-mails in connection with official business of
the agency are public records regardless of
where they are sent from.

Text messages in connection with official
business of the agency are public regardless of
whether a personal or State phone was used.
3

What is not a public record
Personal notes or drafts for the personal use of
the writer.
Notes, records, emails related to the personal
life of the agency employee.

4

Put the request in writing.
Public Records Act does not require that
requests be submitted in writing.
Benefits:
Eliminating uncertainty about what was
sought and when.
Email is sufficient.
Confirming delivery helps.
Possible detriment: The request is a public
record.

5

Ask to inspect unfamiliar
or voluminous records.
Do not reflexively ask for copies.
The cost or volume may make that undesirable.
It may help you and agency narrow the request
to make it easier to comply with and the
requested documents easier to use.
..

6

Ask for a written response
if any of the request is
denied and a citation to
any exemption claimed.
Public records law requires identification of
any exemption claimed.
Redaction/Exemption specificity issues.
Subtle encouragement to comply with the law.
Putting it in writing creates a record to be
looked at.
.

7

Ask for a prompt
acknowledgement and
response.
Law requires reasonable time for response/production.
Set a timeframe.
Try to define reasonable in advance.

8

Be willing to take one bite
at a time.
Be practical.
Be (or appear) reasonable.
Cost may be a factor.
Less may be more.

You can always follow up.

9

Be willing to negotiate
Relationships and reputation matter.
Art of the deal.

CHAPTER 119 - SAMPLE PUBLIC
RECORDS REQUEST
Addressed to the custodian of records for the agency
[commission, board, etc.]
Pursuant to Florida’s public records law, I request that
[agency] produce [for inspection or copies] the following
public records:
[describe the records with as much specificity as you can]
Should you deny my request, or any part of the request,
please state in writing the statutory exemption which
provides the basis for each such denial.
I will contact your office [e.g., the next day] to discuss when
I may expect fulfillment of my request, and payment of any
statutorily prescribed fees.
If you have any questions in the interim, you may contact me
at the email address set forth above or at [telephone
number].
Thank you.

What can I do if my public
records request is
denied?
Write about it.
Sue.
The public records act is construed in favor of
openness while exemptions are construed
narrowly and limited.

In lawsuit, the burden is on the agency to show
that a record is exempt from disclosure.
If the agency loses in a court action seeking
disclosure of the record, the agency is usually
ordered to pay court costs and attorneys’ fees to
the person seeking disclosure.
12

How much can an agency
charge for public
records?
Generally, no charge for inspection.

Usual fee for copies is 15 cents a page for standard size
pages.
For all other copies, the custodial agency can charge the
actual cost of duplication.

If production of the records requires extensive use of
information technology resources or extensive clerical or
supervisory assistance, the agency may charge a reasonable
service charge based on the actual costs incurred.
A court has defined extensive as taking in excess of 15
minutes.
Regardless of basis, if the charge seems high, ask for a
written explanation of how it was calculated.
