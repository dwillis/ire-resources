The Problem: Census data comes in massive, unwieldy packages.
Massive: The 2009 one-year estimates that came out last year
included more than 33,000 fields of data spanning nearly 1,500 tables.
Unwieldy: There are numerous ways to download, import analyze
Census data, all of which require moderate to advanced CAR skills.
With rare exceptions, the material the Census Bureau hands you on a
platter (press releases, ranking tables, etc.) is okay for basic fact lookups, but does not constitute an analysis.
The Approach: Doing good work with Census data requires a healthy
dose of prep work, so let's start there.
Also, I'm assuming in this presentation that the goal is to extract
stories from Census releases -- if your goal is to download the entire
Census release so you can build an intranet or Web app, that's a
completely different discussion that I won't cover here.
Anyway, my step #1 is: Familiarize yourself with the hierarchy of
tables. One way to do this is to actually play with the data. If you go
to http://factfinder.census.gov, click "get data" under the American
Community Survey link, choose detailed tables, pick the U.S. or your
state, you get three options for browsing the data. For beginners, the
easiest might be "by subject" --- for those not online, I'm listing the
hierarchy of tables right here:
====Population and Housing Unit Totals and Geographic Concepts====
.... Housing Unit Totals
.... Population Totals
====Population Totals - Race and Ethnic Groups====
.... American Indian and Alaska Native
.... Ancestry
.... Asian
.... Black or African American
.... Hispanic or Latino (Including Types of Hispanics)
.... Hispanic or Latino/Not Hispanic or Latino, by Race
.... Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander
.... Race (Including Detailed Categories of Race)
.... Some Other Race
.... White
====Race and Ethnic Groups - Social, Economic, and Housing Characteristics====
.... American Indian and Alaska Native Alone
.... American Indian and Alaska Native Alone Householder
.... Asian Alone
.... Asian Alone Householder

.... Year Structure Built

So this is how everything is organized, a top-level topic -- "Economic
Characteristics" -- and then a mass of sub-topics, and within each subtopic, a large collection of data tables.
Step #2 is the part where you really dive in -- Read the table shell.
No, I'm not crazy -- the table shell is a spreadsheet containing a
complete list of every table and every field in the release. And it's not
exactly written in fine prose -- it's a big, honking list.
I will grant you that reading the table shell at first will seem like a
most tedious and unnecessary chore. But here's why it's important: If
your goal is to extract high-end story ideas, you need to not only know
everything that's available to you, but you also have to train your
brain to think Census. Reading the table shell will be your boot camp - you will not only quickly pick up on patterns, such as the way the
Census handles racial breakdowns, but you'll also rapidly start to come
up with ideas, and that's the goal, correct?
My advice would be to set aside a full day where you can go
someplace and really concentrate -- and record your ideas, along with
the corresponding table numbers as you go along. Having this list of
ideas and table numbers will serve you well for as long as you cover
demographics. Another way of thinking about it: You always here
anecdotes about how great investigative reporters are those that read
the fine print in proposed legislation, study the bond prospectuses, dig
out facts from obscure documents, etc. This is your chance to do the
same with demographics.
Once you have a list of ideas, now comes step #3: Breaking it down.
Some people might consider this next section two distinct parts -getting the data you want and analyzing it -- but I feel that these two
jobs are so interrelated, I'm keeping them together.
Basically, before going out to get data, let's think about how we're
going to analyze it first. Let's say you're interested in the topic of
home ownership -- "tenure", in Census parlance. You can't just look

up the main tenure table and write a story saying what the current
home ownership rate is. You need to make contextual comparisons
that will result in "findings" that can support an actual news story nut
graph.
Among the paths you might follow to produce findings:
-- Geographic comparisons that rank and compare states, counties,
towns, tracts, etc.
-- Sub-group comparisons that break your topic down by race, gender,
education level, etc.
-- Historical comparisons that show how your subject has changed
over time.
-- "Custom" comparisons that mash up your data by factors that you
define. (These are awesome when they work, and I'll illustrate in a
moment)
Just as a quick example, let's go to Socialexplorer.com, a demographic
site run by our friends at Queens College. They have an interface for
grabbing data that is similar to the Census Bureau's Factfinder, but
somewhat faster and easier.
I'm going to look at home ownership in U.S. in the 2009 ACS, broken
down by component.
I go to http://www.socialexplorer.com, click on reports, click on ACS
2009. I'm going to pick United States as my geography. Then to get
tables, I'm going to search by keyword "tenure".
The number of Census tables that come back to you is stunning:

Of course, this is just the starting point. Immediate questions that
come to mind: How do these gaps compare in different states and
counties? How do they compare over time? What other home
ownership breakdowns would be relevant -- there are dozens to
choose from...
Lastly, I want to get back to the concept I mentioned earlier: "Custom"
comparisons. Sometimes you'll be working a topic and breaking it
down all the ways possible and you'll raise questions that can't be
answered with Census data alone. For example, let's say you're
ranking counties based on home ownership rate but want to be able to
describe the KINDS of counties with high or low home ownership rate.
One way of extending your analysis is to bring in third-party data -- in
this example, I'm going to use county typology codes produced by the
Bureau of Economic Analysis, a branch of the Ag. Dept.
http://www.ers.usda.gov/Briefing/Rurality/Typology/
With a database manager such as Microsoft Access, you can mash up
the county classifications generated by the BEA with your own countylevel data. For example, the BEA has a rural-urban classification
scheme known as the "Beale" code (see:
http://www.ers.usda.gov/briefing/rurality/ruralurbcon/)

So in this example, counties with a strong manufacturing base have a
higher home ownership rate than other counties, and education rates
are not a factor. But in counties without a manufacturing base,
education levels are more of a factor.
In a real world example, you'll often find yourself doing dozens and
dozens of queries like this to break down your topic any number of
ways.
It would also help if you bring GIS software into the mix so you can
see geographic patterns (there are several GIS panels and hands on at
this conference). I also find it extremely useful to use PUMS data -- a
anonymized database of individual Census returns that can be
aggregated into custom tables (also covered in other panels at this
conference.)
