(#chickfila)

Other story ideas …
❖

How your representative is spending his/her
allowance compared to others

❖

How much members take in personal perks, such as
travel reimbursement

❖

If your representatives are being as fiscally
responsible as they said they’d be during the
campaign

❖

If members are “walking the walk” when it comes to
paying interns/minimum wages

❖

How big your representative’s office in Washington is
vs. their number of district staffers

Warnings
❖

“Detail” file is the one you want, but for some
reason (?) it includes “totals” as rows in the
middle of the data

❖

Names and descriptions can vary from year to
year
