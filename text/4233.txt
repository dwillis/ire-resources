IRE Conference
San Francisco 2014

The Campus Assault project
• Interviewed 50 college officials
• Interviewed 33 female students
• Surveyed 152 crisis-services programs
• Examined 10 years of school complaints to the Office of Civil Rights
• Analyzed a 130-campus collections of sexual assault incidents from
the Office of Violence Against Women
• The last three were data-driven.

What we found
• Student victims face litany of barriers
• Which often assure their silence
• Or leave them feeling victimized again
• See Key Findings here

A culture of secrecy
• Mystifying disciplinary proceedings
• Off-the-record negotiation sessions, or confidential mediations
• Gag orders that have been found to be illegal by the Education
Department

A culture of silence
• Many don’t report at all
• Most don’t identify what happened as assault
• Institutional obstacles compound problem

Official data problematic
• Doesn’t begin to reflect true scope
• Limitations and loopholes in federal mandatory campus crime
reporting law
• Systematic problems in documenting total numbers of campus sexual
assaults

Getting started
• Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security and Campus Crime
Statistics Act
• Know the law and what to expect from the data reporting required by
the act

http://www.splc.org/knowyourrights/legalresearch.asp?id=19

Clery Act basics
• ‘Campus Security Authority’
• Anyone on campus who supervises students or campus activities
• Campus police officer, judicial affairs dean, coach, residence life
director
• Anyone designated to respond to victims
• Only counselors exempt

Reporting strategies
• Look up annual Clery reports for five years
• Compare and search for “red flags”
• All zeros, ones, and twos
• Sudden spikes in numbers
• Different numbers for same years over time

Test the reality behind those numbers
• Conducted a scientific survey of 152 on-campus and off-campus
health clinics that service students
• Used stratified geographic sampling so that all regions of the country
represented
• Promised anonymity
• Used qualifying questions so that we limited answers to students
• Collected data on their official current year reports of campus sexual
assault and rape incidents to compare with Clery data
• Many, many of the universities in the survey reported zero-two rapes
hade scores of rapes, according the health clinics

FOIA for all kinds of records
• 10 years of complaints filed with DOE
• Statistics from schools on judicial hearings
• Formal hearings versus informal processes
• Dispositions and, if so, sanctions
• Names of students found responsible
• Individual judicial case files
• But not electronic in columns or rows
• So built our own database

Tracking the system’s failures
• Build our own database of 10 years of findings in DOE Office of Civil
Rights closed complaints filed by parents and students
• Tracked allegations, campus responses, findings and penalties filed by
the office against the universities
• Only 24 cases resolved
• Of the five cases where the findings went against the university, the
university received no penalty

Tracking the process
• DOJ Office of Violence Against Women keeps records on campus
sexual assault for about 130 universities that take federal funds for
campus awareness programs
• Data collection administered by University of Southern Maine
