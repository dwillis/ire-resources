Pitch vetting checklist
Amy Pyle, Editor in Chief, Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting

❏ IMPORTANT: Will this expose a hidden problem and/or tell our audience
something new? Will it make a difference?

❏ INTERESTING: Why should someone read/listen to it? Is it timely, newsy, in
the Zeitgeist? Is it compelling?

❏ SCOPE: What is the minimum/fallback story and what would it take to land it
(time/resources)? What is the maximum/dream story? Is it worth the effort?

❏ REPORTING: Who is being harmed and how? Who is responsible and can you
prove it? Can you quantify the problem?

❏ STORYTELLING: How will you humanize it? Who are some primary
characters: a whistleblower, a victim, a bad guy?

❏ DETAILS: Tell us about any data/documents you already have in hand and any
tape you already have gathered.
