The Odd prerequisite
You probably need these two ideas before we go any further.
Probability, aka p
Among all events, what portion results in the outcome of interest? A decimal
fraction ranging from 0 to 1.
Odds aka O
The count of events with the outcome of interest divided by the count of events
without that outcome. A number ranging from 0 to whatever.

The Odd relationship with Probability
You can convert from one to the other.

p = O / (1 + O)
O = p / (1 - p)
So your 0.5 probability of getting heads in a coin flip would be odds of 1.

You probably already use probabilities
Journalists often do this using a comparison known as relative risk. It’s the
probability of an outcome for one group divided by the same probability for another
group.
Let’s say 30% of Democrats voted in the Presidential primary, and 50% of
Republicans. Divide them, and you get 1.67.
We could write that Republicans were 1.7 times more likely to vote, or subtract 1
and say that they were 67% more likely to vote.

The same thing differently
You can make the same comparison using odds. The result is called an odds
ratio.
The odds of a Democrat voting are 0.43. (That’s 0.3 p of voting / 0.7 p of not)
And the odds for Republican are 1. ( 0.5 / 0.5)
Divide them and you get 2.33. That’s the odds ratio.
We could write that the odds of Republicans voting were more that twice as great
as for Democrats.

The null model: 45% of people stopped for speeding got a ticket. If we had no
other information than that someone was stopped for speeding, we could
guess that they did not get a ticket and be right 55% of the time.
