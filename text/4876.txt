Building expertise on trauma
for better watchdog + investigative reporting

WHY IT MATTERS
• Because sometimes we hurt people
• Because sometimes we hurt ourselves
• Because sometimes we hurt journalism

BREAKING JOURNALISM

3

THE THREE ACTS

• Act I is about the traumatic event

• Act II is about the victim
• Act III is the search for meaning, even when there
may be none — this is where the investigative
reporter can shine light into dark places.

SO, WHAT ARE TRAUMATIC EVENTS?

• “Potentially traumatic events are powerful and
upsetting incidents that intrude into daily life. They
are usually defined as experiences that are lifethreatening, or where there is a significant threat
to one's physical or psychological well-being.”
• — Australian Psychological Association

THE BRAIN & TRAUMA

9

WIRED FOR SURVIVAL

• In the midst of assault, the brain's fear circuitry
takes over while other key parts are
impaired or even effectively shut down. This
is the brain reacting to a life-threatening situation
exactly as it should.

10

WHY THAT MATTERS FOR REPORTING
• Survivors of trauma might not be able to tell you exactly
what happened to them
• They might remember different things at different times

• They might not understand their own behavior during the
events, or why they behaved the way they did at the time
• That sense of confusion might cause them to leave out
details that make them feel ashamed because it’s common
for trauma survivors to think they did something wrong
that caused the event
11

OTHER EFFECTS

• It disables survivors’ ‘radar’
• It causes confusion
• It inhibits expressions of emotion

12

“YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO…"

Do you give the people you talk to
a “Miranda-style” warning?

13

HYPERALERTNESS,
A SENSE OF A LOSS OF CONTROL
Let survivors have a role in
deciding:
• Where to talk
• When to talk
• How long to talk
Ask about:
• Taking photos, making video
• Support system
Explain your process in detail
Explain you’ll have to ask some
tough questions

Explain possible consequences of your
reporting, including the possibility that
nothing will change
Explain that talking might not be
“therapeutic”
14

“LISTEN AND VERIFY”

“Galbraith had a simple rule: listen and verify. ‘A lot
of times people say, ‘Believe your victim, believe your
victim,’” Galbraith said. “But I don’t think that that’s
the right standpoint. I think it’s listen to your victim.
And then corroborate or refute based on how
things go.”

“SHE JUST ‘FLIPPED THE SWITCH’ ”

16

MOST OF US ARE RESILIENT

17

RECOVERY, RESILIENCE, GROWTH

• Resilience is adaptation in the face of
adversity, trauma, tragedy, threats or stress.

18

NO NEED TO AVOID

NEVER assume that someone won’t want to talk to you.
NOTICE if you’re avoiding because you don’t want to feel uncomfortable.

19

KNOW THYSELF

Most of us can and do go about the day to day of covering
the news without serious, negative consequences.

Until we don’t.

20

THE RESEARCH

Most journalists do not report chronic distress associated
with their work.
However, several recent studies have documented increased
rates of psychological distress for some journalists, especially
those, such as war correspondents, whose assignments
involve life threat and witnessing death, dying, and human
suffering.
21

THE PROBLEMS

• Understaffing

• Persistent fears about admitting when work has become a
problem
• User-generated content

• Too much “lip service,” not enough real concern by
employers
• Editors sometimes engage in useful self-deception

ETHICS, GOOD PRACTICE MATTER

24

DART CENTER TIPS ON SELF CARE
Before a potentially traumatic assignment

• Consider talking through possible emotional risks with someone
• Agree how you will keep in regular touch, particularly if difficulties
arise.
• Agree that partners and families are kept informed.

• Maintain strong social supports and peer networks.
• See crises as challenges to learn from. Maintain an optimistic outlook
and positive self-view.
• Remember that the journalism of trauma matters. What you do is
important and worthwhile.
25

ON THE JOB
• Understand that distress in the face of tragedy is a normal human response – not
weakness. Most people recover soon enough.
• Ensure proper eating, hydration and sleep. All of these can affect judgment.
• Easy on ‘self medication’. Overuse of substances is an indicator that all is not well.
• Get some exercise if you can. Even a walk helps break down ‘stress chemicals’
• Take breaks – and encourage others to as well. This assists integration of material
and enables clarity.
• Acknowledge your feelings. Understanding feelings informs your journalism and
helps you process trauma.
• Talk to others. Take time to reflect on what you are witnessing.

26

WATCH FOR…
• Disorientation or ‘spacy’ feelings.
• Difficulty doing simple tasks or problem solving.
• The ‘100-yard stare’.

• Impulsivity, extreme anger, argumentativeness, violence.
• Feeling super distracted.
• Distortion of time.
• Expressions of futility, helplessness, terror, fear for ones life, shame.
• Physical or mental exhaustion.
