Shell game
Data: A database constructed from flight
logs, aircraft registrations and corporate
documents

Story: Topping the
government’s list of
Hurricane Katrina costs is
$568,000 for debris

Story: The CIA operates at least seven
shell corporations that appear to have no

as PFA, can collect
unlimited contributions,
and though forbidden from
coordinating with
campaigns during an
election, they can join
forces with them in the

post-election season. PFA –
which describes itself as
“independent.” – has

has aligned itself with
nearly every Bush issue.
