Covering the Affordable Care Act
Using numbers to help make sense of Obamacare
Meghan Hoyer, USA TODAY mhoyer@usatoday.com @meghanhoyer
Federal exchange plan data: Premium costs, deductibles and co-pays for the thirty-seven states that use
healthcare.gov for signups: https://www.healthcare.gov/health-plan-information-2015/ Make sure not
to miss the three states whose files are separate from the pack.
Some caveats: The individual marketplace data does not use FIPS codes or a unique key for each
county. And if you want to compare one year’s data to the other, not all county names are the
same from year to year – create a separate crosswalk to clean up county names and join census
data or uninsured population data to the file. Propublica’s ACA dataset has a crosswalk built in
under its ACA Plan Compare Data: https://projects.propublica.org/data-store/
Don’t just look at premiums! Although a lot of consumers will choose a plan based solely on
premiums, deductibles + copays can play a big role.
The second highest Silver plan in each county is used to help determine individual subsidies, and
is usually seen as the benchmark plan. To identify these benchmarks with SQL:
- Use the RANK() OVER function to rank the silver plans and find the second-highest.
DENSE_RANK accounts for ties and gives you consecutive rankings.
- You don’t want a rank of all plans across the country, though – you want a rank of all silver
plans in each locale. To group the rankings by state and county use PARTITION BY.
RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY FieldToGroupBy, FieldToGroupBy ORDER BY FieldYouareRanking)
AS Rank
- My code:
SELECT B.*
FROM (SELECT DENSE_RANK() OVER (partition by State, County ORDER BY
Premium_Adult_Individual_age_40) AS BenchPlan, *
FROM QHP_2015_Individual_Medical
WHERE Metal_level='silver' and Premium_Adult_Individual_Age_40>0) B
WHERE B.BenchPlan=2
State Exchange data: Thirteen states + DC have their own exchanges. This data should be available
through the state insurance commissioner offices.
Others collect this data, which often isn’t in the same format as the federal exchange data:
- McKinsey on Healthcare:

- Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s HIX compare (silver plans only):
http://www.rwjf.org/en/library/research/2014/03/breakaway-policy-dataset.html

Enrollment data: HHS puts out enrollment “snapshots” on its blog weekly during the enrollment period:
http://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/facts/blog/index.html

The Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation office puts out more detailed information
periodically, including (at times) zip-code and county-level enrollment data and end-of-theenrollment period reports: http://www.aspe.hhs.gov/
SHADAC collects state exchange reports. (SHADAC also has lots of data on insurance coverage,
health care access and costs at a state-by-state level and is willing to share with reporters)

Web developer Charles Gaba collects state and federal exchange enrollment data and includes
projections that are remarkably accurate: http://acasignups.net/

Who are the uninsured, and where are they?
The potential enrollee pool for ACA health coverage through the exchanges isn’t the same as the
American Community Survey’s tallies of the total uninsured population for a state or region. Potential
enrollees in the health care exchanges must be legal residents. They generally have to have incomes at
100% of the poverty level or above. They must not have access to insurance through their work.
Best potential enrollee data models:
By state - Kaiser Family Foundation State Health Facts: http://kff.org/health-reform/stateindicator/marketplace-enrollment-as-a-share-of-the-potential-marketplace-population-2015/
In smaller areas (zips, counties, MSAs) - Enroll America and Civis Analytics (you have to call and
ask but they are generally helpful): http://www.enrollamerica.org/blog/2014/10/updating-ourdata-model-to-find-the-uninsured/

The best think tank and research (and sometimes data) resources:
- Kaiser Family Foundation: http://kff.org/uninsured/
- Price Waterhouse Health Research Institute: http://www.pwc.com/us/en/healthindustries/health-research-institute/aca-health-reform.jhtml
- The Commonwealth Fund: http://www.commonwealthfund.org/topics/affordable-care-actreforms
- The Urban Institute: http://www.urban.org/health_policy/
