Get ready for your fire season well before the first fire trucks hit the road.
•

Know what resources are available to your firefighters and what kinds of commitments they have
towards other areas.

•

Learn the paper trail.
Most wildfire-fighting command centers are required to file daily incident reports with the US Forest
Service. These reports are known as 209 reports, they exist in electronic form. They summarize a fire’s
size, wind speed, growth potential, burning materials involved, personnel and equipment devoted to
the fire-fighting effort. These reports also record where the help came from and track additional
manpower and planes, bulldozers or other machinery.

•

Check if your state has a computer system tracking requests for fire-fighting resources.
California has such system. There has been a push to build a similar nationwide system. Check out
what resources your community has available. Where will it turn for help if a disaster strikes?

•

Find data and experts well before the first flares touch your turf.
