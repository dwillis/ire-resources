Washington Post: Capitol Assets
• Published in February
– Two part series
– Reporters: David Fallis, Scott Higham and Kimberly
Kindy, plus Bobbye Pratt (research)
• Exploring the intersection of public spending by
lawmakers and their private portfolios
– This installment: Earmarks benefitting themselves or
family members
– Note: Focused on earmarks secured prior to the “ban,”
which many contend has only driven practice
underground.

Main findings
• Overall: 49 lawmakers directed earmarks to
public works projects near their properties or
directed earmarks to groups employing family
members
• Included lawmakers who:
– replenished beaches in front of vacation homes they
owned
– overhauled streets in front of personal residences
– revitalized downtown around an office building
– steered funds to universities where spouses hold senior
positions
– directed money to nonprofits that employed children.

Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger’s condo at Ocean City, Md. where
beach replenishing was partly funded with his earmark.

Sen. Richard Shelby’s office building in downtown
Tuscaloosa. More than $100 million in Shelby’s earmarks
have revitalized the surrounding city blocks.

Rep. Hal Rogers home in Somerset, Ky. His
earmarks gave his street a major facelift.

Broader points
• The lack of transparency by Congress and that this
alignment of private interests and public activities is
permitted and legal.
• Ethics rules so narrow, lawmaker would have to build a
pool in backyard that no one else used.
• No disclosure mechanism to identify private interests when
seeking earmarks.
• Merits of some earmarks debatable, others clearly
worthwhile. We steered clear, however, of engaging on
that issue. The proximity – the hidden intersection -- was
the point.

The stories …
• Developed out of a very simple concept:
– Compare broadly the financial disclosure forms of all
535 members of Congress to the public record.
– What do lawmakers disclose vs. what does the full
public record show?
– Analyze each member’s disclosure forms for interesting
patterns.
– Knew we’d likely find things of interest: The forms are
an incomplete picture by definition
• Dollar value ranges only, not all assets, poor
descriptions of where property is located, etc.

Financial disclosure forms
• Easy to obtain and free.
– Available from opensecrets.org, legistorm and the
Clerk of House website (as .pdfs)
• Databases of information from the forms also available
– Center For Responsive Politics has keypunched and
makes available at opensecrets.org. Must register.
• We used both analog and digital versions.
– Could search across lawmakers’ holdings with the
computer records. Paper records, however, gave more
context, clues to broader holdings and information
overall.
– And, ultimately, the paper (.pdf) versons are the official
record signed by members.

Developed a records punchlist
• Of scores of items to check on every single
lawmaker when reviewing his or her
financial disclosure forms
• Included: Real estate, jobs held by family
members, court records, licenses, etc.
• This reporting relied heavily on LOCAL
public records available for FREE via the
Net from our desks.

Key resource: County real estate databases
– Assessor’s offices, tax collector’s offices & recorders offices
– The ability to search these remotely was critical. Could not have
done this project 10 years ago, prior to the widespread availability
of this level of detail at your desktop. Would have to fly all over
United States, work phones or send runners.
– Most of these databases are free to use (might require registration)
and they, unlike Nexis, are typically the up-to-date official record.
No middleman issue.
– Many have interactive maps, legal information, plat descriptions,
and pictures. In some cases, link to recorders’ indexes or the actual
filings including deeds and deeds of trust.
– Used record portals like BRB and Netronline to quickly identify
what was – and was not – available online in counties where
lawmakers owned property. Remember: Often rural, out-of-theway counties.

Tracking what we found
– Shared documents among the four of us
via Google docs and spreadsheets
– Basically building a database of our
findings.
– The red flags: Notes of what we found,
what to check further.
– All of us had different lawmakers.

What were we looking for?
• Anything and everything.
• No preconceptions.
• Mindful and alert to all the possible
ways officials duties might align or
overlap with their own personal
interests.

Holdings vs. Earmarks?
• As we compiled more and more addresses and properties
the lawmakers had interests in, began to vet these against
other sources.
• At some point, decided to vet against spreadsheets listing
earmarks that had been compiled by Taxpayers for
Common Sense and were available on the group’s website
for FREE.
• TFCS had keyed in earmarks for 3-4 fiscal years, primarily
from the Congressional record.
• Initial checks found proximities. We saw enough to know
it was worth reporting further.
• NOTE: The earmark “ban” not an issue for our reporting.
Most of our work pre-dated the ban.

The matching
• Had to be done by hand, given how data recorded.
• The TCFS data had geographic information on some of the
earmarks, but it was only as good as the lawmaker had
provided. In other words, often very poor and imprecise.
• Even when we found “matches” (two miles or less
generally), we had to go to state and local authorities to
confirm earmark locations. Required filing many FOIAs
with federal and/or state/local agencies spending the funds.
– Roads might be referred to generally, w/o any indicator
as to mile markers or nature of work, etc.
– Or work on a beach might be listed as “beach
replenishment, Maryland shore.” Had to report to know
exactly what beaches the earmark impacted.

We also expanded the scope …
• To include universities, nonprofits and other organizations
that the lawmakers had sent earmarks to.
• Found these groups employing family members of
lawmakers
– Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee earmarked millions of dollars
to University of Houston where her husband is
longtime senior administrator.
– Rep. Norm Dicks sent earmarks to an environmental
agency run by his son.
– Rep. Tim Johnson helped send earmarks to a Pentagon
program employing his wife.

Publishing
• Capsules of all our cases in addition to
those in stories.

• Maps of the earmarks near properties.
• Video narratives accompanying the
two days.
• Lawmakers main response: Proximity
was coincidental.

About that “ban”
• As earmarking increased, reporters and watchdog groups,
publicized dubious earmarks. The public backlash
eventually prompted Congress to make changes, beginning
in 2007. For the first time, lawmakers were required to put
their name next to earmarks they sought. Last year, as
criticism and scrutiny mounted, Congress imposed a twoyear moratorium on new earmarks. The Senate this year
extended the ban another year.
• Some contend the moratorium has just driven the practice
underground. Six months into the moratorium, Sen. Claire
McCaskill (D-Mo.) identified more than 100 special
spending provisions in a House defense bill that she said
were clearly earmarks.

Main hurdles?
• Time!
• The financial disclosure forms
– Opaque and fraught with misleading,
erroneous, unchecked information.
• They leave off, misidentify or only partly
identify property they own.
• Earmarks poorly described
– In the Congressional record.
– Much reporting to determine specifically where
and how the money spent.
