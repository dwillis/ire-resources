Military Mindset
When it comes to using databases and other computer-mined information to track trends
in the military, consider changing IRE to intelligence – instead of investigative –
reporting and editing.
That’s what we’re doing, we’re cribbing together bits and pieces, creating a mosaic using
our own efforts, to paint a picture that’s likely never been sketched before, or at least not
in the way we’re likely to do it. We’re looking at reports, data and information from
different vantage points – drilling down or stepping back – and stitching together a fabric
that we hope makes sense of it all and puts it into a perspective that readers will find
understandable, valuable and usable.
That’s much the same thing that intelligence officers do in the services and agencies we
cover.
Doing Recon
The military loves records. It keeps them on everything, and, best of all, it loves to put
them into databases.
Here are some things to keep in mind:
 Anytime the military wants to buy anything, there’s a record of it: a request for
bid, a contract, an agreement of understanding…
 The military often breaks down purchases by weapon systems, states – even
Congressional districts. The Pentagon does this so it can lobby to keep funding.
Reporters can use this to track funding, contracts, etc. fairly easy. A good place to
start: http://www.dior.whs.mil/peidhome/procstat/procstat.htm. Also try
www.defenselink.mil – navigate to the contracts page, which has a daily listing of
contracts and a searchable archive. For a longer-term look at major Pentagon
projects, try www.acq.osd.mil/ara/am/sar/.
 IRE has an excellent federal contractors database – try www.ire.org
 You may have to build your own databases, depending on the contracts you want
to analyze or deconstruct. There are some things the military services simply
don’t want to track.

 Look for small databases to build yourself. It’s a great way to see how databases
work, how they can be queried and how the information can be diced and
segmented.
 The U.S. Government Accountability Office, or GAO, publishes an annual
overview of every major weapon or weapon system – and with a thumbnail sketch
of issues and problems with each. Go to www.gao.gov
 The folks at globalsecurity.org also offer analysis of not only weapons, systems
but just about everything military – including bases, policies and issues. The site
is www.globalsecurity.org Another helpful organization for such analysis is the
Federation of American Scientists – www.fas.org

Tools of the Trade
There are some types of software that it will be essential to have and know how to use –
or to know someone in the newsroom who and knows how to use – to properly mine the
military data trove:
 a spreadsheet program like Excel;
 a database manager – most use Access now, but some old-timers like me prefer
FoxPro;
 a statistical program like SSPS (OK, this may not be essential, but I have found it
very valuable).

There are other tools that would be helpful. One is a electronic file organizer to keep
straight all of those reports, databases and sources. I like SourceTracker from newsengin.
And I also find digital cameras useful. I take shots of a scene the same way I would take
notes – and I take pictures of documents that I can’t copy for one reason or another.
Computer-Assisted Reporting
Remember, computers represent just another tool.
Too often, reporters rely on CAR to try to do all the work. They throw out graphs and
charts and numbers to impress everyone with all the work they’ve done – making the
readers perform a mental juggling act to keep it all straight and to relate to the story.
After you’ve found the right Web sites or squeezed the juice from the right database, find
the people behind the facts. You must tell readers what it means – and especially what it
means to them.
This is not a new concern. In his 1978 book Investigative Reporting and Editing, Paul N.
Williams, quoted CAR reporters at the time: “As the reporter works more regularly and
closely with computers…he is in danger of losing touch with the people and reality that
the people constitute.”
Often, it can be difficult to find the “people factor” in reporting about defense contractor
cover-up or state-of-the-art weapon. Reporters must find metaphors, anecdotes and other
means to help the reader, to make the readers think and act.

Look for ways to compare, to engage the reader – to have fun.

War Stories
Military databases abound for the those who want to find them. Here’s a short list of
some general ideas.
When the 3rd Infantry Division got ready to deploy for its return trip to Iraq, two Apache
pilots died in a in-flight training accident. I checked with the Army Safety Center at Fort
Rucker (http://safety.army.mil ) to get a handle on just how much of a problem Apache
accidents had become. I found that Apaches accounted for the some of the most costly
accidents in the service.
I sent a FOIA to the center for all of its accident records going back decades. I used
FoxPro and SPSS to slice, data and mine the data to show, among other things, that the
Army had suffered more accidents during peacetime than war years and that the biggest
accident danger were those who rode in land vehicles without seatbelts.
Along the same lines, I sent a FOIA to the Coast Guard and used the CAR software to
document the daily danger the service’s helicopter’s pilots faced – and those the aircraft
would try to rescue – because of underpowered engines.
FOIAs can be of little help when writing about the intelligence world. Most of the
material is classified and can be withheld.
But, using databases, we can give a peak into the kind of money spent for such programs.
I used the IRE federal contractors’ database to check through about 3 million records
going back to the end of the Cold War to trace the billions of dollars spent on classified
space satellite programs for a Defense News story. We also showed how the number of
classified contracts or modifications had tripled after the 9/11 attacks.
If you want to start smaller, you can build your own database using public sources.
For example, www.defenselink.mil can be used to trace contracts through its searchable
online text records. At Defense News we found every development contact for the $250
billion Joint Strike Fighter – the Pentagon’s most expensive project ever – and built our
own database we used to show the Defense Department had already spent or contracted
for $39 billon of the $40 billion the government had set aside to develop the plane. With
another six years to go, the program was sure to bust its budget and when we showed our
figures to analysts they agreed and we had a story.
In putting together the database, I opted for the simplest and most necessary fields –
contract number, modification number, what the change was for, the increase or decrease.
Mod-ern Methods
How could the costs go up, sometimes by hundreds of millions of dollars, for a ship,
plane or other piece of equipment?
Contract modifications.
In covering local government, they’re often called change orders – many are costs that
were “encountered” or “discovered” after an original contract was signed.

One key difference between a local government change order and a contract modification
on a multi-billion-dollar aircraft carrier is that, as strange as it seems, there’s a much
smaller level of scrutiny on the bigger-buck carrier.
Modifications often go unnoticed. Congress, once it approves even the largest of military
contracts, rarely keeps keen tabs afterward.
Recently, the nation’s only builders of rocket launchers announced a merger – basically
to a monopoly – to put the nation’s military satellites into orbit. They were doing this,
they said, to save the government money. The launch amount had doubled because the
commercial market had dried up – or so the Air Force and contractors said.
An online search and quick database search showed how the service and contractors were
telling only half the truth.
A GAO report showed other reasons for cost increases – like the hundreds of millions the
Air Force spent to switch a launch from one contractor to another after the first company
had been barred from defense work due to ethical violations.
Or the billions added on because the government had miscalculated inflation.
I went to www.defenselink.mil and typed in the launch program name. I found a contract
modification because of the ethics contract switch. I typed that number in the contractors
database and found in 2003 alone 15 modifications worth a quarter of a billion dollars.
Patience
Babe Ruth struck out nearly twice as many times as he knocked one out of the park.
It’s better to strike out – to let a story go that’s just not there – than to put something into
print that’s not quite right.
That’s especially true when reporting on defense contractors.
These companies do important work, but their major raison d’etre is to make money.
They could give seminars on how to fillet a reporter and even a newspaper if a story’s off
the mark by even a little.
Tread carefully. But do tread, with the proper low threshold of indignation. We have a
public duty to scrutinize these companies – and the military we pay for.
