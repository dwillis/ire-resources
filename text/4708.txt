Dana Williams & Rachel Schallom

Four Steps

1. Figure out what you want.
2. Figure out what you have.
3. Hold a training session.
4. Give feedback & thoughtful
communication.

Figure out what you want
● Does your newsroom need to pitch ideas earlier?
● Do you want more emphasis on data journalism?
● Do you want standalone interactives?

You might be tempted to say, “We want more of everything,” but
you will need to prioritize.

Figure out what you have
● What would it take to make what you want?
● Do you have the skills on staff? Can you develop new skills or
hire new people?
● Just about every beat will lend itself to data journalism, but
not every reporter will be interested in doing data work. Find
the ones who are.
● When you know what you are looking for and have the
capability of producing it frames what you ask for.

Hold a training session

You don’t have to train everyone — or everyone at once.
Show people what is out there and what can be done.
Use IRE/NICAR training resources.
Tell them what to look for.
Give lots of examples of different types of content.
Tell them what your time constraints are.

Give feedback & thoughtful communication
● Not every idea is going to be good. How you say NO is super
important to maintain the flow of ideas.
● Keep an eye out for variety.
● Take every opportunity to teach.
