Origin of the story: black homeownership
● Story on black homeownership in south Chicago
suburbs
● Followup: ​owning real estate has not panned out
for African Americans
Data: House Price Index data from Federal Home
Finance Agency (FHFA)
A look at raw data for zip code 60461
Row showing loss since 1990
Process: join to demographics from American
Community Survey five-year data by zip code, classify
by whether black-headed homeowner households are
a majority of homeowner households (“black
majority”) -- switch to 2000 base and classify by “lost

value” (index less than 100) or “doubled or more”
(index at least 200)
Conclusions
● Black-majority zips are nine times more likely to
have lost value since 2000 (18% of black-majority
zips vs 9% of other zips)
● Black-majority zips are also somewhat more likely
to have gained a lot of value since 2000 (17% of
black-majority zips vs 12% of other zips)
