FAIR WARNING: Don’t attempt undercover projects using hidden cameras or
microphones until you have consulted with news management and your lawyers. Laws
differ from state to state. They’re not always the same for video and audio recordings.
And different rules apply based on if you’re recording in what’s considered a public or
private or place. Know your limits.
Here are some other basics to remember:
PLAN CAREFULLY: Once you’ve established what’s legal, plan the details of the
shoot. Think strategically about your approach. What equipment best suits your
situation? Remember, good audio is often more important than the video. Think
seriously about your options if something unexpected happens. What are the
implications if something goes wrong?
BE REDUNDANT: Equipment can fail .. or a camera can be out of position or
temporarily blocked. Multiple angles also help you edit.
WATCH WHAT YOU SAY: Remember anything you say – even walking in or walking
out – can be used against you if the material is subpoenaed.
