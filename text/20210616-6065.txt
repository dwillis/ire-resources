We like using Google tools in these ways for our reporting
- Google Sheets source tracker; you can also make these in Microsoft Excel (here is a
template!).
- Dialogflow for building chatbots, including textbots. Here is the homepage. Here are
YouTube tutorials.
- Flyers (we use Google Docs to create them; you can also make these in Microsoft
Word). Here is a template.
Other non-Google tools
- Bit.ly is your friend for tracking link clicks.
Doorknocking best practices
- If there are only two questions you could ask a source to know whether you want to
continue the conversation about your particular story, what are those two questions?
- If you can only reach these sources one time, what is critical to ask?
- Make a Google Form to hold your question script — keep it to just the essentials. Fill it in
while you ask questions at doors. (If you’re lucky enough to have a second person, have
them take notes and record while you interview!)
- Trust us on this one. You’ll thank yourself for keeping organized notes.
- Stay in sync with everyone simultaneously door-knocking. We like Google Keep
for this. Here is what one could look like:

Textbotting/phone banking best practices
- Develop your script with experts (people who live in the community, academics who
study these kinds of communication or subject matters)
- Incorporate privacy language into the bot
- Don’t overwhelm your respondents
Phone bank best practices
- Find out their schedule, make sure to call when they’re not working
- Develop a script
- The more, the merrier
- Your colleagues
- People who sign up
