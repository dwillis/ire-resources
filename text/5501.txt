Ways your data can make you crazy
before you ever set eyes on it.

You sort of know what your editor wants you to get,
but you’re not really sure where to find it.
Or how to ask for it.

Find the Retention Schedules.
Connecticut’s are on the state library website.

Check out datasets on Data.gov.
Peruse them. They lay out a map of the data on your beat.
You’ll also learn government-speak, which will make the ask easier.

The Ask
** Do not forget the data dictionary.

Wait. Before you ask,

PREPARE. STUDY UP.

FOI. OPRA.
FOIA. ORA. FOIL.
What does your open records law say about electronic records?
Make sure you know that part of the law. At the federal level, DOJ
recently launched a (mostly) one-stop shop at FOIA.gov.

“... shall provide, to any person making a request… on paper, disk, tape or any other electronic
storage device or medium requested by the person, including an electronic copy sent to the
electronic mail address of the person making such request.”

The Ask
** Do not forget the data dictionary.

Keep templates of state and federal requests in your Dropbox or Google Drive.

Don’t forget the data dictionary.
Ask for the record layout and all relevant documentation for the dataset in your FOIA.

Crunch some numbers of your own.
Just a small spreadsheet for reporting, nothing fancy.
A simple spreadsheet sent me over the edge a couple years ago. I wasn’t
proficient enough to do it quickly, so I ended up grabbing a legal pad and doing
the math by hand.
It happens. It’s frustrating. It gets easier.

Evaluating what you have

Question #1 for your data

What’s wrong with you?
(Something. Always.)

Going big defect
hunting
Data problems
●
●
●
●
●

Entry errors
Not standardized
Nulls, blanks, zeros
Weird outliers
Etc.

Universe problems

●

Missing data
Duplicated info
Misunderstanding
the data
Shift in standards
Etc.

How: Sketching out your data’s background
Because the defects aren’t always inherently obvious.
Some other questions to potentially throw into the mix:
●

Why is it kept?

●

What do they do with it?

●

Do they keep any documentation
for it?

●

Who works with it regularly?

Best practices once you start working...
● Make and copy and stash the original somewhere
● Don’t overwrite fields; make changes in a new space
● Keep track of what you do
○

Memory refresher if you have to come back to a story at a later date

○

Showing your work makes it easier for someone to replicate

● Know your data

...And things to avoid while you’re working
(All things I have done over the years.)
●

Queries that unintentionally force double-counting
○

●

Bad joins
○

●

I sketch Venn diagrams!

Try doing them a few different ways (more Venn thinking)

Not sufficiently probing the unexplained
○

Forms of assumption — on a spectrum from “complete trust” to “global conspiracy”

...And things to avoid while you’re working
●

Overemphasizing small numbers in relative terms
○

And vice-versa

●

Spot cleaning when you need to deep clean

●

Getting too caught up in high-level summaries
○

When you overlook a potential story

Ways Excel will try to get you fired
Excel assumes your data is clean. It’s a messy world.
If you have blank rows, you have problems. If you have blank columns, you
have problems. If you try to sort when one row is highlighted, or a few cells,
you have big problems.
Solution: Control-A to select everything, or Control-* to see what’s contiguous

More ways Excel will get you fired
A number’s a number, unless it isn’t.
Like that time New England disappeared off your map, because all the 5-digit
ZIP codes beginning with 0s became 4-digit not-really-ZIP-codes.
Or that time Excel looked at a really big number, and rounded it off, and
suddenly none of your property tax parcel data worked.
Solution: Define your column types as text when you import.

Aim carefully
It’s awful easy to write a
formula in row 2 that
refers to row 3, or you
grab the wrong columns. If
you miss, you have a big
problem. Excel will
highlight what it’s using as
you type your formula.
Missing is bad.

Should you quit using Excel for complicated stuff?
Probably.

SQL is trying to make you crazy
Error messages have meaning. It’s not always immediately clear. Read them.
Slowly. And again.
Sometimes it’s as basic as an extra space, or you forgot to say “from
tablename.”

Jimmy can’t read, and SQL can’t count
Check your import statement results against an actual row count of your data.
Sometimes … half of it will go missing. Or an insert will fail entirely. (Line
endings are a problem, often.) wc -l is your friend. (Available for Windows, too)
Note that
select count(name) from mytable
is very different from
select count(*) from mytable

The best advice on bulletproofing stories …
...
Is
Not
Here.
See IRE’s web page, resources, tipsheets, search on bulletproof.
https://ire.org/resource-center/tipsheets/?q=bulletproof

But maybe we can help a bit.
Start with a smell test. Is the second-most popular dog name really likely to be
Mortimer? Is the congressman you sort of kind of didn’t know was in your
state likely to be the biggest vote-getter?
Some great stories come from data outliers. Some craptastic errors come
from data outliers that were dirty data.

2+2=…?
Leave the big grinding data analysis aside
for a moment. Does your stuff literally
add up?
Do the totals of your row-level data match
the totals the agency gave you?
Does your database have an identical
number of rows as the original data
source?

Did you spot-check your data?
Forget the data, even.
Does some old paper record match your app’s version of the data set?
Have you cross-checked the as-provided data and your processed data?

Reality has a well-known anti-deadline bias
Have you looked at the ground truth or other records to confirm?
Have you run your data by a beat reporter and sources?
Did you get the actual record layout, and verify the column headers mean
what you think they mean?

Stop and think again
Warning signs
include:
Confused experts
A trend contradicted
by other evidence
Something seeming …
off
