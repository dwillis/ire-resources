For a project to reach its full potential, dozens of things have to go right. This tip sheet examines what is
needed to build a successful investigation – from vetting ideas to building teams, framing stories to rocksolid fact-checking, devising a social media push and developing a follow up plan.

Vetting the idea









Write a proposal memo: Require a nut graph. It helps sharpen thinking and decision-making about
what you’ve got, where the holes are and whether the story is worth it.
What has been done before? Do an honest, aggressive search on the topic. What has been done on
this subject, and by who, in the past five years? If the topic has been written about, can you advance it
or tell it in a new way?
Weigh impact vs. effort: Is the story worth the effort? This can be hard to assess at the start.
Constantly assess – is the story getting better, the path getting clearer? If not, it may be time to pull the
plug.
Minimum vs. maximum: Don’t launch without knowing what the minimum story is. Ask: If we learn
nothing more than we already know, what do we have?
Evaluate data and sources: What is the data? Is it gettable? Is it existing data or build-your-own data?
Public records or private records? How much of this effort is documents, how much people?
Discuss visuals early: Make sure art, graphics, data visualizations are part of the pitch. These days a
story is not a text-only presentation. All elements should work together.

Building a team


Seek complementary skills: Match a graceful writer with a digger – someone who loves numbers and
documents.
 Include the beat reporter: They can accelerate the reporting, since they know the topic and sources. It
can also reduce friction in the newsroom.
 Round out the team: Include photo, graphics, digital, copy desk, production, etc. Everyone needs to feel
an ownership stake early in the process – not as a service function when everything is decided.
 Discuss how the story is best told: Can it be broken into distinct pieces? What information can stand
alone? How does it live in the various media – print, online, video, audio.

Reporting the story

Establish a rough (and realistic) schedule: Discuss what needs to be done by when. Set specific
benchmarks. Then add a few extra few days for each phase, and save time for legal review.
Reject the idea of a three-month project: Don’t let the reporting become a wilderness expedition.
Instead of a three-month project, think of it as 12 one-week projects, with specific goals for each.
Regular meetings: Meet with the team at least once a week. Early on, try to do this in an informal
setting, such as going out for lunch.
Check in even more often: Do this even on a daily basis. Listen to a reporter’s worries, cheer their
successes. Know the story (approximately) as well as they do.
Written progress reports: Along the way demand outlines, story summaries and bullets. They help
focus the brain on what’s important, what’s not and what’s still missing. Reporters should do this while
information and ideas are fresh. (As an editor, keep your own journal based on what you are hearing)
Discuss interview benchmarks. Decide your schedule for seeking interviews with the main subjects.
When do you first contact the main subject/s? How much more time before emailed questions?
Create one-sentence targets. For example: “The mill is dumping toxic waste in the creek.” “The mayor
is on the take.” What will it take to prove each assertion? Do you have the goods? Can you get the
goods? This can become a useful organizational tool in the writing process.
Start thinking early about characters, themes: Who are the people who can help the story come to
life? What are their best quotes, anecdotes, killer examples?
Be sure the reporter is reading. Clips, documents, reports … Read everything that is available. Do this
reading before the interviewing. Often reporters are too anxious to interview too quickly.
Be sure the reporter is writing: Write a top early, including nut graph and transition. Once you’ve
wrestled that to the ground, everything else becomes easier. This allows the reporter to test ideas,
rehearse what they want to say to readers.
Do the graphics early: This applies as well to data visualizations, motion graphics, etc. This allows others
to make progress and lets the writer focus on a cleaner, clearer story.
Recognize when the end is near: Are interviews becoming less fruitful and more redundant?

Editing the story


Do a structural edit first: Look for major organizational issues, flow, holes, etc. Is the furniture in all of
the right places?
Then do an aggressive line edit time: Examine the story section by section, paragraph by paragraph,
line by line for clarity, accuracy, fairness, polish.
Do a table read: Get everyone around a table and read the drafts out loud. You’ll notice gaps, stumbling
points. This will also give the full team freedom to weigh in on other aspects.
Get an outside perspective: Give it to someone to read who has not been involved, for a fresh eye in
terms of comments.
Manage the other pieces: Are the photos coming together? Videos and graphics? It’s not enough that
everything on the list gets done. Often things have to happen in a certain order.
Prosecute the story: Test the integrity of the story at all turns. How might subjects challenge it? Has
everyone been given a fair chance to make their case?
Leave adequate time for fact checking: Understand each reporter’s system, allow enough time for it.
Can they support every point, via a document or interview? Do they need to circle back to sources who
were talked to early? Never cut corners here.

Following up


Social media strategy: What is the audience for the piece? How do you get this story in front of them,
wherever they are?
 Follow up stories: Think beyond the immediate reaction follow. What are the next big pieces to be
told? The next two big stories to be told? Start work on them even before the initial story is finished (ie.
records requests, etc.)
 Save some things: You need to own the long after the initial investigation is done. Save a few stories for
after the big project runs, and parcel them out in the days that follow. Reporters may have kitchensinked it, and tossed in extra stuff. Can it be split off and stand alone?
