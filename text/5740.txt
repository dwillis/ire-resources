“Other cities are tackling
this problem with costeffective prevention
strategies… We'll tell you
exactly how these programs
work and what they might
cost. And we'll examine
what's keeping Cleveland
from adopting these smart
solutions as a way to
protect our children.”

MEASURE

SUCCESSFUL
CITIES

CLEVELAND

Inspection of
homes

Before children are
poisoned

After children are
poisoned

Testing of homes

Regularly after
inspectors notice
potential problems

Less than half the
time inspectors
noted problems.

Testing of
children

Widespread,
before symptoms
emerge

After symptoms
emerge

Protection of
children

Rental registry
records homes
with known
problems, prevents
rental to families
with young
children

Rental registry
exists, but is not
used

Consistent
remediation of
problem homes

Homes remediated
only about half the
time

Follow-through

The Plain Dealer
compared other
cities’ experience
with Cleveland’s.
Reporters found
far lower levels of
lead poisoning..
They found
common-sense
fixes that
Cleveland had not
implemented, and
that readers could
understand.

Impact
What happens when you
take away the excuses
• Cleveland’s health
department director
and 3 of 4 deputy
commissioners fired or
resigned
• City lead inspection
staff rose from 3 to 7
• City passed plan that
proactively inspects
rental homes for first
time, modeled on
program highlighted in
series
• State threatened city
unless it complied with
list of reforms
• State published list of
banned homes;
Cleveland now posts
warning signs on
affected homes

Solutions Journalism: How a
solution-based approach can
strengthen investigations

Why use a solutions component?
• Had done a lot about what was wrong with
the foster care crisis, children dying after
their families had been visited by CPS, the
state cutting services.

How to integrate it into problemfocused reporting
– In order to talk about the solutions, we had to remind
readers what the problem was and how we had gotten
here.
– We couldn’t talk about solutions without understanding
and investigating exactly where the problem was.

We decided to split the project into three
sections: Prevention, Intervention and
Reinvention in order to have the opportunity
to talk about the problem for each, use the
intro to highlight major findings and solutions
and then really go in-depth about solutions
proposed in different stories.

How to find and get solutions?
– Spent a lot of time talking with local experts and
stakeholders about what they were seeing
– Held roundtable discussions with foster care
experts, service providers and former foster kids to
get their take about what was wrong and what
could have made a difference.

– My colleague Emily Bregel put
together a spreadsheet with the
potential locations, the reforms
they had undertaken, the pros
and cons and statistics on their
progress
– For example, by talking to local
experts she discovered that one
of her locations actually
wouldn’t be a good fit because
income levels were so different.

•

The team tried to look at places that
had similar demographics,
government, child welfare system
where the solutions could
realistically apply.

•

For one of my stories, for example,
we had visited a place in California
during a fellowship with Annenberg
and when I came back I kept hearing
how one of the main issues was
groups not working together and so
I went back and did more reporting
on that group and presented as a
potential solution here.

What are some of the challenges?
– You have to know the topic incredibly well in order to
figure out whether it’s a good fit or not.
– You are proposing a solution to the problem, so you
have to make sure it’s not something that’s already
happening in your community or something that is not
applicable there.
– I was new to child welfare, so I had to rely a lot on my
colleagues and their sources. And even for me at the
end, I feel I was just getting started.
– You have to look at it as a work in progress.
– Even after you launch your initial investigations, the
work is far from over. You have to continue to report on
it and to hold people accountable.

How to fund this kind of work?
– The solutions component was critical to getting funding.
– We had seen that the Community Foundation of Southern Arizona
was already funding a foster care project with the Arizona Republic
so we approached them.
– We also applied for a fellowship with Annenberg for additional
support.
– Overall there’s no clear cut answer on what to do or not to do.
– What worked for us in this case was identifying a nonpartisan
nonprofit that was interested in this issue.
– Be clear from the beginning about what each side expects. No
editorial control.
– They asked us to pay upfront the travel cost and file expense
reports after.
– We invited them to our roundtable discussions and my editor sent
periodic updates to let them know what we were working on.

Impact
• Make practical changes the community and stakeholders
can implement.
• Think outside the box. Consider partnering with a
theater to produce a play. Hold community forums. Make
yourselves accessible to readers to explain the project.
• Continue reporting on the topic. It’s an ongoing process.
• With solutions journalism in some ways it’s planting the
seed and it takes a while for people to get onboard with
what you are proposing. So for us this is just the
beginning. Maybe not as in-depth as what we have just
done but more consistent focus on this very complex
issue.
