Datawrapper
Based in Germany, hence the .de ccTLD in the URL
It’s free, unless you want it customized for your newsroom
Great for making very standard charts and tables; not so
great for things like bar + line hybrid charts
Pretty gentle learning curve
Excellent way to standardize your organization’s visual
style guidelines without ever hav to say that phrase to
non-design savvy staff like reporters and editors

Let’s make some charts!

We already made you an account

NICAR2017!

122%

NOTE: Respondents were
asked about the news
they got on their main
topic in each instance.
Numbers add to more than
100% because respondents
could report using more
than one pathway in each
survey.

How to get reporters excited about, well ...
doing more work
Photos (i.e., images of charts) drive engagement on social media. It is known.
Making a chart is a form of data analysis and therefore part of the reporting
process. If you wouldn’t report a story by proxy, you shouldn’t outsource the
creation of a chart to another department.
Practice makes perfect. The learning curve can be conquered with persistence!
Overall data literacy enhances a reporter’s bullsh*t detector.
Set aside time for 5-10 min. refresher courses for people who want to make
their own charts, but have forgotten how to do it.
