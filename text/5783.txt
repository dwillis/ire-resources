Sell it before you tell it. Promoting the story ahead of time:
1) What social media will you use to promote the story?
2) Find at least three pictures or graphics to put on social media ahead of your report.
3) Are there any influencers who could help spread the word about the upcoming report?
(PTA members, mommy groups, professional association members, etc.)
4) Have you scheduled your social media ahead of time?
5) If you promote the story on your news organization’s Facebook page, take time to read
and respond to comments.
The story itself:
1) If your primary story is in the newspaper, on the radio or on TV, what is your best push
to your online story?
2) What is your web script headline? Did you select words people would use in a Google
search?
3) What internal links can you use to other stories on your website?
4) What external links can you use?
5) What breakout elements do you have for the online presentation? (Chart, interactive
map, timeline, etc., police dashcam video, etc.) You’ve spent time on the data, this is
where you can show it.
After the story:
1) Post the link to the story on social media so people can find it.
2) What follow-up opportunities do you have to continue the investigation?
3) Look for opportunities to back-sell the story when possible. Investigative stories have the
longest shelf life of news on the web, so when there’s a reason to link to the report
again, make sure you do it.
