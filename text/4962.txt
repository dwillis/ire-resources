THE ART OF THE INTERVIEW
Landing 3 Types of Interviews We Often Need:
-The Victim/The Family/The Protagonist
-The Insider or Key source
-The Reluctant or Obstructionist Official

THE ART OF THE INTERVIEW

Getting “The Victim”/ “The Family” /“The
Protagonist”

THE ART OF THE INTERVIEW
The Steps We Take:
-Before you pickup the phone: it’s homework
time

THE ART OF THE INTERVIEW
The Steps We Take:
-People take you more seriously if you show
them you will work hard to understand the issue

THE ART OF THE INTERVIEW
The Steps We Take:
-Whenever possible get in front of people in
person

THE ART OF THE INTERVIEW
Three notes on meetings:
-Don’t Overpromise
-Pledge to tell their story fully, truthfully accurately –
nothing more
-If you are going to meet with the victim in advance of
an interview consider whether you would offer hat to
the other side as well

THE ART OF THE INTERVIEW
When you talk:
-Address reluctance head-on
-Ask: “You seem hesitant. Tell me why?”
-Explain why they should talk to you. “People need to
hear your story because….”
-Be upfront about the topics you plan to cover

Getting “The Insider” or Key Source

THE ART OF THE INTERVIEW
Getting “The Insider” or Key Source
-With insiders many of the same techniques
used with victims/families apply
-But their reluctance may be greater because of
potential fallout.

THE ART OF THE INTERVIEW
Getting “The Insider” or Key Source
-Address the risks/concerns head-on
-Figure out what motivates them

THE ART OF THE INTERVIEW
Getting “The Insider” or Key Source
Appeal to their sense of right and wrong by asking questions that
focus them on right and wrong:

-Don’t you think you’re in a unique positon to tell this
story?
-it seems like you have information few other people have?
-If you don’t share this who will?
-How long will this injustice go unheard if someone doesn’t
speak out?

THE ART OF THE INTERVIEW

Getting “The Reluctant Official”

THE ART OF THE INTERVIEW
Getting “The Reluctant Official”
-Get officials on camera
-Develop “anti-written statement” policy
-NBC 5 position: You work for us (taxpayers) you talk to us (when it’s a serious issue of public
safety or public trust)

THE ART OF THE INTERVIEW
Getting “The Reluctant Official”
-Be transparent
-Be nice. Even when they’re not.
-Repeatedly call and e-mail (and document the
calls and e-mails)
-If there’s no response or a negative response….
time for “THE LETTER”

THE LETTER

THE LETTER
-If no response, we sometimes contact their boss and request
an interview.
-Or, we show up to talk to them just as we told them we
would in “THE LETTER”.
-We shoot unscheduled interviews only after getting an ok
from our news director
-We try to avoid unscheduled interviews as much as possible .
It’s typically much more fascinating/insightful/informative if
you can get the subject to sit down
-If you have the goods that will become very apparent in a sitdown interview more – more than if you are chasing someone
through a parking lot.

CONDUCTING THE INTERVIEW
FIRST STEPS
1. GET THE RECORDS

2. GET THE GUIDELINES/STANDARDS/RULES/LAWS

CONDUCTING THE INTERVIEW
STEPS BEFORE THE INTERVIEW
HOMEWORK/RESEARCH:
Laws, applicable standards, internal rules, best
practices, policy manuals, etc.

How to Use FOI Laws and Overcome Request
Roadblocks

CONDUCTING THE INTERVIEW
STEPS BEFORE THE INTERVIEW
COMPARE AGENCY/COMPANY/SUBJECT’S RECORDS
TO THE APPLICABLE STANDARDS

DURING THE INTERVIEW
During interview see if the interview subject
will agree to the existence of the
law/standard/rule first – or if they will agree to
a certain standard of conduct/performance.
VIDEO EXAMPLES:
WTU
ZIKA

DURING THE INTERVIEW
BE PREPARED FOR THE UNEXPECTED!
When they throw you a curve ball – or say
something off the wall – start by repeating back to
them what they said. This buys you a minute to regroup – and often times by restating what they said
in a neutral way - they will go even farther with
their claim
