Be Wary of the Horse Race
Journalists tend to differ when it comes to assessing the newsworthiness of election polls
(See “Dewey Defeats Truman”). Consider the source of the poll, the size and makeup of the
sample (actual voters vs. nonvoters) and the specific questions asked. Don’t just go with a
press release from the campaign or the polling organization: ask for the complete report or
rundown of the responses.
It may seem elementary, but the rate at which ballots are counted on Election Night doesn’t
mean much. The more homework you’ve done, the more the ballot count will mean
something if you know what precincts or counties those ballots came from.

The Money: Follow It
Thanks to the Internet and computer spreadsheets, tracking the flow of campaign cash has
become steadily easier. Official and non-government Web sites alike contain valuable
campaign finance information:
• Federal Elections Commission: www.fec.gov/
• Association of State Election Directors: www.nased.org
• National Association of Secretaries of State: www.nass.org
• Center for Responsive Politics: www.opensecrets.org
• PoliticalMoneyline: www.tray.com
• National Institute for Money in State Politics: www.followthemoney.org
• Public Interest Research Group: www.pirg.org
Besides the candidates, keep an eye on their political parties, the special interest groups
that mount “independent campaigns” and the PACs that give the most.
