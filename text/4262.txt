Federal Databases


EPA’s Toxic Release Inventory (1.usa.gov/1jMNHzD)
 tracks the release (including spills), transfer, recycling of

certain toxic chemicals
 manufacturing, mining, coal, hazardous waste
management
 covers federal facilities of a certain size and type
 annual release numbers, self-reported

TRI Explorer

Harris County, TX, Petroleum sector:
benzene, HF, H2S

Toxicology/Environmental Health
Ambient air and water quality
 After accidents (pipeline ruptures, refinery
accidents, West Virginia MCHM, etc)
 Guidance on safe exposure levels
 Numbers based on animal experiments and some
human testing (mostly worker exposure studies)
 Parts per million (ppm), parts per billion (ppb)


Resources
EPA’s IRIS database
 National Institute for Occupational Safety and
Health (NIOSH—part of CDC)
 Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry
(ATSDR—part of CDC)
 Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA)
 Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment
(OEHHA—California EPA)

Few Federal Standards


Agencies have different guidelines, with various
caveats
 to protect workers or the general public?

 length of exposure—1 hr? 24 hrs? 2 weeks? a year?
 enforcement power?
 is cancer risk included?

Pipeline Accidents
PHMSA (Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety
Administration)
 General statistics and report (1.usa.gov/1oTH0QW)
 Data on pipeline spills 1980’s to present (updated
monthly), .csv files (1.usa.gov/1A5kOqV)


 oil pipelines, gas pipelines, jet fuel, etc
 self-reported company data
 details on how the spill was discovered, fatalities, cost of

remediation, etc
 requires cleaning

State Databases
Oil and gas regulations mostly left to the states
 Every state is different: air permits, water permits,
waste permits, multiple agencies, scattered
databases
 Find a guide

Community/Other Databases


skytruth.org and fractracker.org
 maps, satellite images, reports, charts



wellwiki.org
 inspections, violations, waste, production numbers
 regulatory data on each well, plus user-generated

content


publiclab.org
 balloon mapping

 DIY spectrometer
 DIY hydrogen sulfide monitor
