8 documents for investigating prescription painkillers
Eric Eyre
Charleston Gazette-Mail
IRE Phoenix 2017

1. Lawsuits (Ask plaintiffs where did they get pill/prescription #s alleged in
complaint? Ask for the supporting documentation from both sides. Get depositions
after suits settled).
2. Suspicious drug order reports (Drug wholesale distributors sometimes flag
pharmacies that order large quantities of controlled substances; 11 states require
such reports; DEA also but agency won’t release; the reports help identify possible
problem pharmacies).
3. State pharmacy board annual reports (many track opioid prescriptions by year; Get
to know the staff member who oversees the prescription monitoring database).
4. State health statistics center/office of drug control policy (for info on fatal
overdoses by drug type, naloxone administrations).
5. Board of Medicine disciplinary reports on doctors who overprescribe.
6. Search warrants (see PACER) for ‘pill mill’ docs and pharmacists
7. Pain clinic inspection reports (state health facility license boards have started
inspecting pain clinics)
8. UCC lien filings with Secretary of State or state Corporation Commission (to find
connections between drug distributors and specific pharmacies) and bankruptcy
filings in federal court (wholesalers listed as creditors after rouge pharmacy gets
shut down).
