possible to find some interesting material, such as interviews with Bin Laden
from publications in the Arabic countries

WHAT TO DO WHEN THE PAGE YOU´RE LOOKING FOR IS NOT
LONGER AVAILABLE
Access to public information has been restricted or temporarily suspended from
several web sites after the events of September 11th. There are ways, however,
to retrieve those once free-access records and documents.
• Way Back Machine: http://mail.archive.org/index.html
The Internet Archive and Alexa Internet have created the Way Back
Machine. The Way Back Machine offers snapshots of the Internet and
millions of web pages. Type in the URL you want to take a look at, and then
pick from the dates on which the site was archived. The Way Back Machine
stores not only homepages, but all levels within the website has been
captured. This is a great resource for finding a document for which you now
get an Error 404--Not Found message.
• Google Cache: http://www.google.com
Google is not only a great search engine; it can be useful in other ways, too.
Google saves a copy of all the web pages in its index. This means, if the
page you are looking for is unavailable because a website is down or busy,
or if it has simply disappeared, it can be found instead in Google´s cache
archive.
For example: an Energy Department Report on the dangers of liquified gas
has been password protected but can be found on Google´s cache.

For more information: OMB Watch is keeping a list of information
removed from government websites and of changes in public access to
government information since the September 11 terrorist attacks.
