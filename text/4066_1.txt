A few of my favorite (health data) things

The volume of public data on our health care system keeps growing and growing. Here are some of my
favorite data sets:
A good place to start is
https://data.medicare.gov/. This includes
information about hospitals, nursing homes,
doctors, dialysis facilities and home health care
companies. Data includes demographic
information (names, addresses, phone numbers),
as well as quality and satisfaction measures.
ProPublica used the emergency room quality
measures to power its ER Wait Watcher app
(https://projects.propublica.org/emergency/).
The federal government has also started making
available online its deficiency reports for health
facilities. It currently does so for nursing homes
(http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Provider-Enrollment-and-Certification/CertificationandComplianc/FSQR
S.html, scroll down under “related links”) and for hospitals
(http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Provider-Enrollment-and-Certification/CertificationandComplianc/Hosp
itals.html, scroll down to downloads).
The
friendly
done

Association of Health Care Journalists has created a
interface for hospital reports
(www.hospitalinspections.org) and ProPublica has
something similar for nursing homes
(http://projects.propublica.org/nursing-homes).

An underappreciated data set explores
geographic variation in health care—how
different parts of the country use health
services at very different rates. The Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services makes
several years worth of data available online
at
http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-G

eographic-Variation/GV_PUF.html.
Finally, some other places to look:
Medicare cost reports:
http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Files-for-Order/CostReports/index.html.
The website American Hospital Directory (www.ahd.com) is a good resource for reporters on
cost-report data.
Hospital inpatient/outpatient charge data:

ovider-Charge-Data/index.html
Healthcare.gov data on Obamacare plan premiums and copays:

Incentives paid to physicians for electronic prescribing:
