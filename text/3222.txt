Bubble maps
• Show differences in magnitude
• Good for finite data sets
• Works for serious and fun projects
• Figure out how many variations, set up an
icon for each size (use PHP to automate)

Icon clustering
• We use ClusterMarker
• Combines overlapping points into one
• Cuts down on memory for large data sets
• Offers other smart features:
– Zoom map to show all points (fitMapToMarkers)
– Can show/hide groups easily
– Has built in triggering of point from outside map

Polylines/Polygons
• Display of non-point data is a weakness of
Javascript API
• A few works well, but many slows things way
down
• Somewhat buggy in Internet Explorer on Windows
• Do any testing related to polygons on server side
to increase speed

Encoded polylines/polygons
• We don’t use it much, but can cut down on
string length, download time for complex
polygons

KML overlays
• Allows most points, polylines, polygons that
are displayed in Google Earth to be used in
Google Maps, but not as interactive
• Bug when clicking on KML-generated
polylines for Windows Internet Explorer
• Can inherit or overwrite styles

Ground overlays
• Not very interactive in Javascript API
• Can use 3rd-party methods to use WMS as
ground overlays, though -- super cool if it
works

Google Earth videos
• Uses pro version of Google Earth ($500/year)
• Can draw lines, boxes directly in Google Earth (not
as professional-looking)
• Can add overlays (vector images that you can
resize work best) from other programs
• New historical data fills in some gaps
• Export video, slice it up, then use video editor for
final edit

Flash Google Maps API
• Why it’s great: Because Javascript polygons
mostly suck, Web interface has limits
• Can have arsenal of maps, overlays ready
• Take advantage of Flash’s strong points for a
better user experience
• Can use MovieClips as ground overlays
• Very exciting: May be able to use shapefiles as
ground overlays
