Short changed
In desirable areas homeowners are
much more likely to salvage their credit
record by getting their bank to approve
a short sale, which allows them to sell
their house for less than they owe on
the mortgage. In high‐poverty areas
most financially strapped owners have
no such option, so when banks
foreclose on them, their credit is
damaged for years.
Records:
