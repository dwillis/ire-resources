Livable Netherlands
• Kicked out by party board after an
interview in de Volkskrant
• Founded his own party: List Pim
Fortuyn

Camp? What camp?
• Former social democrat
• Anti-immigration, not antiimmigrant
• Blend of left and right
• Openly homosexual
• No connections to ‘classic’ extreme
right

Prime minister?
• Potential winner of elections
• Potentially biggest party
• Assassinated week before elections
• His party became second party
and joined the cabinet

Shift? What shift?
• Huge shift in votes
• But what do voters think?

Bringing in the voters
• Many interviews (600)
• Good sampling
• Structured data acquisistion
• Thorough briefing of reporters

Questions
• Past voting behaviour
• Voting intention
• Views on politicians
• Successes and failures of current
cabinet
• Urgent problems politics should do
something about

Remarkable results
• Stable views over the years
• Shifting votes
• Impopular social democrat leader
• No particular anti-immigrant
atmosphere

After the assassination
• They called him ‘Pim’
• Popular, but controversial
• No mourning votes
• No extreme right tendencies

Conclusion
• Media linked Fortuyn to the
extreme right
• Voters did not
• No change in political views
• Radical change in voting behaviour
• ‘Supply-side politics’

Lesson learned
• Electoral results are determined by
politicians and voters
• Media give much more attention to
politicians than to voters
• Understanding voters is essential
for understanding election results
• So … Bring in the voters
