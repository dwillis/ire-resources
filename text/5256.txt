Ten of the
Most Important Things I’ve Learned
Stephen Stock Tipsheet
1) Don’t give away the farm to interview subject
(go away, step outside, talk on phone, arrive late, put on makeup – do
anything but sit there while photographer sets up)
1a) Rarely –if ever— start with the hardest/toughest question
2) Send your sources birthday and holiday cards (Byron Pitts)
2a) But never get too close with your sources- always remember as a
journalist you aren’t “friends” and can find yourself in an adversarial
position and have to hold accountable
3) Honey, I love you …
Triple check everything!!!
(if your spouse tells you she loves you, get two more sources)
3a) Trust no one without verification
4) Stuck writing?
You can always report your way out of a writing block
4a) Write to video – think about pictures when the words won’t come
and the prose will flow
5) Be OVER prepared
Before the interview or the shoot or the writing
5a) Always ask at least one “smart question” that shows you know as
much or more about a subject than the person you are interviewing

6) What was that? (Chris Clackum)
When you hear a good soundbite, suddenly go deaf or hard of hearing
6A) Have a silent signal system set up with your photog or your team
7) Feed your crew
Take care of them as if they were your family or best friends
(because – hint hint – they are!!)
7a) Learn to manage UP as well
8) Drop gold coins and surprises throughout your writing
(Al Tompkins)
8a) What makes good writing is not what you put in but what you
leave/cut out
9) Do not start your package with best video
End with your best video (Bob Dotson)
(and almost never start package with a soundbite)
9a) Leave them with a memorable thought or video – leave them
wanting just a little bit more (Michael Williams)
10) Tell story in THREE WORDS (Jon Franklin)
Every STORY SHOULD BE SUMMED UP IN THREE WORDS:
NOUN – VERB - ADJECTIVE
10a) Three words focuses everything
from planning, to shooting, to interviews to writing– keeps you out of
‘rabbit holes’
