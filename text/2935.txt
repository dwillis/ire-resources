UNLESS THERE IS A REAL REASON FOR SURPRISE (THE PERSON YOU
ARE TRYING TO REACH IS A CRIMINAL, YOU KNOW THERE IS NO
CHANCE OF A SIT-DOWN INTERIVIEW, THERE IS A HIGH RISK OF
FLIGHT) CALL, E-MAIL, WRITE FIRST…IN GENERAL CONFRONTATIONS
REALLY SHOULD BE A LAST RESORT AND NOONE SHOULD BE
SURPRISED TO SEE YOU OR KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT YOU ARE THERE
TO TALK ABOUT.

•

PLAN, PLAN, PLAN…WRITE DOWN YOUR FIRST QUESTION ON A LITTLE
PIECE OF PAPER…THE FIRST TEN SECONDS MAY BE ALL YOU
GET…AND IT MAY ONLY BE YOUR QUESTION…
BUT, HAVE ALL YOUR DUCKS IN A ROW – YOU COULD END UP
DOING A FULL FLEDGED INTERVIEW ON THE SPOT

•

AT ALL COSTS BE FAIR, COURTEOUS AND CALM – WALK UP TO A
PERSON GENTLY - DON’T BE BELIGERANT OR MEAN OR VINDICTIVE –
MAKE SURE WHATEVER YOU SAY IS A “CLEAN HIT”
BUT…
TOUGH IS GOOD – IT WILL MAKE THE PERSON RISE TO THE
CHALLENGE
DO NOT BE SHRILL –YOU CAN EASILY COME OFF BITCHY OR
WHINY
“IN YOUR FACE” AMBUSHES JUST DON’T WORK-- IT IS EASY TO
COME OFF ARROGANT – TIMES HAVE CHANGED
GOOD STARTERS: “EXCUSE ME SIR, I AM XXX FROM XXX AND WE
WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT XXX” OR …”I AM XXX, FROM
XXX MAY I TALK TO YOU FOR A MOMENT ABOUT XXX”…OR…”HI, I
AM XXXX FROM XXXX AND WE WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT
XXX”

•

KNOW THE PROPERTY YOU ARE STANDING ON – TRY TO GET THE
PERSON TO MEET YOU ON PUBLIC PROPERTY SO YOU AREN’T FORCED
TO LEAVE BECAUSE YOU ARE TRESPASSING

•

DON’T HOUND A PERSON, DON’T FOLLOW THEM AROUND AND
AROUND, CHASE THEM INTO ELEVATORS, ETC. – DISCUSS
BEFOREHAND WHEN YOU ARE GOING TO LET IT GO AND TURN OFF
THE CAMERA.
KNOW YOUR COMPANY’S RULES. SOME STATIONS AND
NETWORKS REQUIRE YOU TO TURN OFF THE CAMERA AS SOON
AS SOMEONE ASKS YOU TO, OTHERS ALLOW YOU TO KEEP
SHOOTING UNTIL YOU HAVE LOST CONTACT
IF YOUR COMPANY ALLOWS IT – YOUR CAMERA CAN BE YOUR
BEST RECORD AND IT CAN PROTECT YOU. A GOOD TECHNIQUE
MIGHT BE TO SAY, “IF YOU ARE ASKING ME TO LEAVE, I’LL
LEAVE, BUT OUR CAMERAPERSON IS NOT ALLOWED TO TURN
THE CAMERA OFF” SOMETIMES THAT ALSO BRINGS THEM
AROUND TO TALKING TO YOU.

•

DON’T TAKE A GANG – A PARADE SCARES AWAY EVEN THE MOST
WILLING TO TALK
A COUPLE OF POSSIBLE – IF APPROPRIATE - SCENARIOS:
IF YOU DON’T WANT TO SCARE SOMEONE - USE THE CAMERA IN
THE TRUCK TECHNIQUE… BUT WEAR A MICROPHONE IN FULL
VIEW AND TELL THE PERSON FIRST THING WHO YOU ARE…”HI, I
AM XXX FROM XXXX AND I AM RECORDING FOR BROADCAST”
USE A HIDDEN CAMERA TO GET PAST THE FRONT DOOR AND
INTO A PLACE WHERE THE PERSON IS…BUT TELL THE PERSON
AS SOON AS YOU SEE THEM YOU ARE WEARING A HIDDEN
CAMERA AND THEY ARE BEING RECORDED

•

KEEP YOUR QUESTIONS SHORT – SHORTER QUESTIONS ALLOW YOU
MORE CHANCES TO ASK MORE QUESTIONS AND GET MORE ANSWERS

•

GIVE ANYONE SOME ROPE – ALLOW THEM SOME SPACE TO GIVE YOU
ANSWERS – IT NEVER HURTS FOR YOU TO BE A BIT CONFUSED ABOUT
THEIR ANSWERS – THEY MAY TRY AGAIN WHICH GIVES YOU ANOTHER
SHOT
GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO UNDERESTIMATE YOU – MOST DON’T THINK
YOU KNOW AS MUCH AS YOU DO

•

TAKE A CLAMSHELL VIDEO WITH YOU TO SHOW THEM WHAT THEY
SAID – MOST ARE INTRIGUED AND WANT TO SEE WHAT YOU HAVE –
THEY CAN’T DENY WHAT THEY SEE

FINAL THOUGHTS:
-LET THE CONFRONTATION HELP TELL THE STORY—DON’T MAKE THE STORY
ABOUT YOUR CONFRONTATION.
-LEAVING VIEWERS WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT YOU ARE A BULLY IS NOT
WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO GET ACROSS IN YOUR STORY. LET THE FACTS
TELL THE STORY AND ALLOW THE SUBJECT TO ANSWER TO THOSE FACTS.
