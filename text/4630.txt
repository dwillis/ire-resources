You can see the final scatterplot here: http://chriscanipe.com/nicar/scatterplotnicar-2016 along with some added functionality we didnâ€™t get to in the session.
You can also clone or download the repository for this exercise along with
thorough documentation here: https://github.com/chriscanipe/nicar-d3-2016
Things we covered in this session:
1) Using global `width`, `height` and `margin` variables to define our working
space.
2) Defining x and y scales to return pixel values for each data point in our set.
3) Defining the `range` (available pixel space) and `domain` (lowest and highest
values`) for our scales based on our data.
4) Using the `d3.svg.axis()` method to build super-sexy x and y axes.
5) Drawing svg elements (circles) to the page based on a set of data.
Please see the repo README file and the documented `index.html` and
`solution.js` files for a thorough step-by-step.
After session update:
EXTRA SUPER ADDED BONUS CONTENT!!!
The `js/solution.js` file contains a fully-documented version of the script we built
in class plus some extra functionality we didn't quite get to. You can see the
[fully-functional chart here](http://chriscanipe.com/nicar/scatterplot-nicar-2016/),
and find the full code in the [project repo](https://github.com/chriscanipe/nicar-d32016).
