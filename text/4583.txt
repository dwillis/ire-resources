What is DocumentCloud?
● Upload documents
● Research text, entities
● Collaborate
● Annotate key portions
● Publish docs, notes, pages

Our workspace lets you
organize your documents into
projects. Here, you also find
tools for editing, analyzing
and publishing.

Drag and drop files to upload
or choose some from a folder.

Explore entities extracted from
the text. People, organizations,
places, phone numbers and
more.

Explore a timeline of dates
extracted from the text.

Annotate key portions of the
text. You can later embed
these separately.

Search across your documents.
“Within minutes, I found all the
times CVS or its pharmacists had
been punished for prescribing the
wrong medication – which is
what my story was about. What
would have taken days took,
honestly, about a half hour of my
time.”
-- Tisha Thompson
NBC4 Washington
