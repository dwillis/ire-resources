AVIATION BASICS
*Two categories: Military and civil (everything non-military)
*Two civil categories: scheduled (passenger and some cargo flights) and general aviation
(everything non-scheduled: corporate jets, personal airplanes, gliders, hot-air balloons,
agricultural sprayers, skydiving)
*Three FAA operational categories
--Part 91: general aviation
--Part 121: large air carriers
--Part 135: scheduled flights with fewer than 20 seats (commuter flights)
General aviation is type of flight operation, not an aircraft.
*Accident/incident: an accident involves death, serious injury or substantial aircraft damage

THE NTSB
*Independent board run by five presidential appointees; five-year terms; up to three members
may be from same political party
*NTSB shall “establish the facts, circumstances and cause or probable cause of” accidents in:
-Civil aviation (must investigate all accidents)
-Highway (NTSB selects accidents in cooperation with state)
-Maritime (involving a public vessel or casualty)
-Pipeline (involving fatality, substantial property damage, substantial environmental damage)
-Rail (involving passenger train; or a fatality or substantial property damage)
*Recommends safety improvements to anyone: federal agencies, manufacturers, associations,
state governments, etc.
*Cannot adopt regulations – wields the power of persuasion
*Blames pilots for ~75% of general-aviation crashes, though many investigations are shallow

BREAKING THE CODE
Each NTSB investigation has a unique 10-character case number. For example: CEN13LA118
The first three characters refer to the NTSB region handling the investigation
*ANC: Alaska Region (Anchorage)
*WPR: Western Pacific Region (Seattle)
*CEN: Central Region (Denver)
*ERA: Eastern Region (Ashburn, VA)
*DCA: Washington, D.C., headquarters office
The fourth - fifth characters are the fiscal year in which the incident occurred
The sixth character is the type of investigation
*M: Major – done for crashes involving scheduled flights; general-aviation flights with

roughly five or more deaths, or that involve someone high profile. NTSB sends a team to the
crash site and extensively investigates numerous factors such as aircraft components, flight
conditions, pilot background, air-traffic control.
*F: field – typically done for fatal general-aviation crashes, particularly those with at least
two-three deaths. An NTSB investigator often will go to the crash site, conduct interviews and
may test aircraft components, review flight conditions, air-traffic control.
*L: limited – typically done for non-fatal general-aviation crashes, or GA crashes with one or
two deaths. NTSB investigators often do not go to the crash site and use information provided by
the FAA and local authorities.
*C: delegated – typically done for non-fatal general-aviation crashes. Fact-gathering is
delegated to the FAA, but NTSB still determines probable cause.
The seventh character is the transportation mode
Aviation; Highway; Marine; Pipeline; Rail
The eighth – tenth characters are a unique code
An 11th character (A, B, C, etc) distinguishes aircraft if more than one is in an accident

QUERYING THE AVIATION ACCIDENT DATABASE
To narrow a search by NTSB region, investigation type or multiple-aircraft accidents, enter
relevant letters in the “Accident Number” slot.
*To query accidents in a single NTSB region, type the three-letter code
*To query by investigation type, type five underline spaces and then the letter for the type of
investigation you want to query. For example, _____M will retrieve all “major” investigations
*To query all multiple-aircraft accidents, type 10 underline spaces and then the letter “B.”
Typing _________B will retrieve all investigations with at least two aircraft (A and B)

INVESTIGATING THE INVESTIGATORS
Accident dockets created since 2009 (and some earlier ones) are on the NTSB website under
the “Investigations” tab at the top and center of ntsb.gov. On drop-down, click “Accident
Dockets,” then “Search,” then enter search terms and click “Find” on right. Earlier dockets can
be requested on line – follow up on your request, or go through public affairs.
*How extensive was an investigation? What components were tested, factors considered,
interviews conducted, factual reports filed? How many people worked on the investigation?
*Were manufacturers involved? Look for a “Statement of Party Representatives to NTSB
Investigation,” which shows companies assigned to investigation, usually to test components.
*What do survivors or their relatives say about probable-cause finding? Have they filed a
lawsuit? What documentation is in the case file?
*Has the NTSB done a special investigation on the type of aircraft or aviation operation
involved in the crash?
*How often has the NTSB blamed pilots for general-aviation crashes in your coverage area?
How thorough were those investigations? How often were manufacturers involved?
