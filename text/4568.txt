Data Reporting on U.S.
Infrastructure: Key Sources
Presented at NICAR 2014, Baltimore
Joe Davis and Liz Lucas

Data Makes Good Stories
• Data describes life-or-death issues, problems, and decisions
• Infrastructure is key to everybody’s lives
• Lots of great infrastructure data out there. Online. Downloadable.
• Data gives stories factuality, scope.
• Too few reporters actually doing data reporting.
• You have to ask the right questions.
• Once you have data, you have to do old-time shoe-leather reporting.

Many Kinds of “Infrastructure”
(we won’t cover it all)

• Dams and Levees (featured today)
• Pipelines
• Drinking Water Systems
• Sewage and Wastewater Systems
• Petroleum Refineries and Chemical Plants
• Electric Power Plants
• Ports
• Waterways
• Bridges ... To name just a few

Dams, Levees, & Water Control Structures
• A key tool is National Inventory of Dams
• Fuller list of databases at SEJ website.
• In the news: coal-ash impoundments (Dan River NC spill)
• In the news: levees around New Orleans (post-Katrina)
• In the news: Heather Duncan series on N. Georgia dam issues
• Feds, States, hide some dam data. You can get it.
• Story is neglect, incompetence, and politics. They say terrorists.
• Link for shared NID

Dams & Levees: Ask This
• Which dams could threaten lives or property if they fail?
• Are the dams in safe condition?
• How many of the risky dams have “Emergency Action Plans”?
• Is your state’s dam safety agency doing good enough inspections?
• How good is progress on Emergency Action Plans?
• How good is funding for dam safety?
• Are dams serving their purpose? (Hydro, irrigation, flood control, etc.)
• What environmental impact does the dam have?
• What are the politics, economics of specific dams?
• Fuller list of story ideas on SEJ site.

Pipelines
• Pipelines carry crude, gas, gasoline, hazardous liquids
• They leak, blow up regularly, often killing people
• DOT’s Pipeline & Hazardous Materials Safety Admin kinda docile
• PHMSA keeps much info secret, esp. when it shows lax regulation.
• In the news: 2013 Mayflower, Ark. pipeline spill
• Data: PHMSA Pipeline Mapping System
• Data: Pennwell ($) maps , GIS data

Drinking Water Systems
• Most communities, all sizes, key to public health
• Pollution a bigger risk than most know
• Law (SDWA) requires info to be public
• In the News: Jan.2014 crisis in Charleston, WV
• Data: EPA Envirofacts
• Data: EPA SDWIS

Sewage Collection & Treatment Systems
• Often a source of water pollution
• Pollution often worsened by big storm overflows
• Often old, crumbling
• Data: EPA PCS-ICIS

Petroleum Refineries & Petrochemical Plants
• Serious pollution threat: toxic inhalation hazard
• Serious hazmat threat: fires and explosions
• Data: EPA AFS
• Data: EPA ECHO
• NAICS Code: Search on group 29

Electric Power Plants (Coal, Gas, Oil)
• Present in many communities. Lights on.
• Economics, fuel, permits, politics, pollution.
• Many coal plants closing now.
• Data: Energy Inf Admin Form EIA-860 detailed data
• See also EPA air permit data
• Data: USGA Wind Turbine Database and Press Kit
• Data: for Nukes, start with NRC list

Transportation Facilities
• DOT National Transportation Atlas Database
• Data: Corps of Engineers Ports Database
• Data: Corps Navigable Waterway Network
• National Bridge Inventory (avail from NICAR)
