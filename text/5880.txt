YOUR REPORTING
(AND YOUR LIFE)

Why me?

Why me?

THERE IS NO ONE WAY
OF STAYING ORGANIZED

How do I do it?

Extensively use Google Drive

How do I do it?

Extensively use Document Cloud

How do I do it?

I create my own tip sheets

How do I do it?
■ Take good notes during interviews, including notes to yourself of items
you want to follow up on.
■ Try to record interviews, particularly key ones. Use Trint, Otter.ai or Rev
to transcribe them.

■ Encourage sources to contact you via Signal.
■ Write methodologies.

How I do it?
■ I keep a written list of things I need to do every day.
■ I use my Outlook calendar for reminders to follow-up on items at
particular intervals.
■ I copy myself on FOIA requests.
■ I keep paper folders for each project.
■ I send follow-up emails after important calls or meetings listing my
understanding of what took place and next steps.

EVEN “UNPLANNED”
INTERVIEWS REQUIRE
PLANNING!!

How can you organize your time
and your day to maximize results
for your investigations?

How to Organize Your
Reporting (and your life)
Plan Your Day
● Plan Your Investigation
● Keep track of records/rolling investigations
●

PLANNING YOUR
DAY

PLANNING YOUR DAY

●

●
●

Schedule shoots/interviews ahead of time
Schedule specific days for logging and writing if possible
Use a cloud based calendar to keep track of shoots (especially for
entire team)
○ Our photogs shoot all special projects, so scheduling is important
○ We submit requests to chief photog, who adds them to calendar
(this way we can all keep track of what’s happening and
determine if we need to go through the desk for assistance)

PLANNING YOUR DAY

●

●

●

Set aside specific time during the day (early, lunch, late)
for phone calls, emails, FOIAs
Make a short to-do list (Keep it handy on phone via
app/notes. I still like sticky notes on my desktop and
visual/paper notes)
Set mental deadlines before your real ones (This includes
shoot times and tasks)

PLANNING YOUR
INVESTIGATION

PLANNING YOUR INVESTIGATION

●

●

●
●

Map out investigation/storyboard (See IRE website for
example)
File PRRs/FOIAs
Make a list of everything you need, including video
Have discussion/brainstorming session ahead of time with
photog (also loop in others like producers, EPs, gfx dept,
web/social at a certain point)

PLANNING YOUR INVESTIGATION

●

●

●

Schedule interviews
Set aside EXTRA TIME for any unplanned interviews and
additional shoots (THINGS CHANGE...so plan for it!)
Communicate with EP/AND, have reality check/update on
progress (this will help with deadlines)

PLANNING YOUR INVESTIGATION
●
●
●
●
●
●

Consider logging/transcription service to save time
Upload video/audio
Auto transcription with timecodes
Playback in editor, allows highlighting (Doesn’t just spit out transcript)
Can download to Word/PDF, share
Can record on app while in field, record phone calls, then transcribe

PLANNING YOUR INVESTIGATION

●

●

●

●
●

Block out specific time for writing/re-writing (Be honest with yourself
about time)
Be specific when ordering graphics (send email, meet ahead of time
to discuss vision)
Make specific notes on script/send final “here’s what you need email”
to photog, make sure cloud or e-folders are updated with all docs,
pics
Give photog as much time as possible
Use time on back end for web/social

Keeping track of records/rolling
investigations
●
●
●
●

Copy/scan all paper documents (Your photog will thank you later!)
Get scanner app
Invest in portable scanner
Create electronic folders (or cloud-based) for all important documents, pictures, extra stuff
○
○

○

Update it when you get new records, label everything
This puts everything in one place for the photog and for you (My photog will drag over
electronic folder right before editing
This also makes it easy to share with others if you ever have to hand off a story

Keeping track of records/rolling
investigations
●
●
●
●
●

●

Consider using color-coded folders for specific projects and records
Maintain a separate file for basic, ongoing projects
Create email folders for correspondence on investigations (this will help you keep track and share)
Date calls/notes
Create Excel, Google sheet with FOIAs/PRR list (topic, need to file, date, complete, can color code as
data returns)
Set alerts on phone (or use app or paper calendar) to keep track of FOIA deadlines

Keeping track of records/rolling
investigations
●
●
●
●

Use Word, Excel, Google Sheets for story ideas
Use Google Sheets for project sharing
Use Word or Excel to keep track of hotline calls
Include callers’ names, numbers and details so you can call back or share with team/desk

Keeping track of records/rolling
investigations
●
●
●
●
●

When pieces air, file away records you don’t need (I do a post-sweeps clean up and move paper items
to filing cabinets)
Use other tools to assist in big projects (dry erase boards, flip charts, large calendars, binders, other
visual tools
Consider organizational apps (See Brian’s presentation!)
Keep thumb and external hard drives handy for storage
DO WHAT WORKS FOR YOU!!
