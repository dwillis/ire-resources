California’s Historic Criminal Justice
Reforms
IRE Annual Meeting, June 22, 2017

Magnus Lofstrom

Poor prison conditions as a result of overcrowding
forced California’s historic reforms
 Dramatic growth in prison population from 1970s to 2006
– Prison population grew more than sevenfold 1980 to 2006
– Corrections share of state budget tripled
 Prison population grew faster than capacity; overcrowding

led to lawsuits
 Federal three-judge panel 0rdered the state to reduce
prison population to 137.5 percent of design capacity (2009)
 Several reforms since then, most significant are
– Public Safety Realignment (2011)
– Proposition 36 (2012)
– Proposition 47 (2014)
– Proposition 57 (2016)

Relationship between reforms and crime is of
critical concern
 Now ample data to draw lessons from realignment
– Added about 18,000 offenders on the street
 How can we measure realignment’s effect on crime trends?
– Need to estimate what crime trends would have been if
realignment had not been implemented
– Identify states with pre-realignment crime trends similar to
California’s and compare post-realignment trends

Role of Prop 47 on crime remains to be seen
 Crime rates increased in 2015
– Violent crime by 8.4%
– Property crime by 6.6 %

 Both violent and property crime rates went up in 2012
– But only evidence that realignment had an impact is on auto
theft
 Nonetheless, 2015 data indicate that compared to other

states, California’s increase in property crime stand out
more than its increase in violent crime

California has lower incarceration and low crime
rates, but on the horizon…
 California still has about 200,000 inmates in jails and prisons, with

state spending at nearly $12 billion
 Need to identify programs that reduce recidivism
 Prop 57 provides CDCR a tool to keep prison population below federal
mandate
– But challenge to meet increased demand for effective rehabilitative
programming
 Counties ability to successfully adapt to reforms and changing

correctional populations
 Questions of effects of Prop 47 need further study
 Court mandate likely to play little or no role in future criminal justice
reform debates in California
– Continued growth in corrections spending
– Cost ineffectiveness of incarceration - alternative strategies?
– Social inequalities, rising tensions
