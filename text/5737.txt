No technical skills are needed for this workshop, though a little bit of comfort with math and
some perseverance will help. You can probably do more with the data if you have some skills in
data fusion or have taken other data workshops.
Please comment here if you have something specific you’d like me to discuss in the workshop.
Or if you have a questions after the workshop. I’ll get notifications about comments.

Please also comment and let me know if you use these resources!
Here’s what you need to know about the scale of our immigration system:
There are some 320 million people in the US. 43 million of them were born abroad. About 11
million people are undocumented and over 5.1 million children have one or more undocumented
parent. ​2.3 million people regularly check in with immigration agents​. 860,000 people have
applied for temporary legal status because they are undocumented but were brought to the US
as children. Over 500,000 people are waiting for their cases to be heard in immigration courts.
Some 270,000 people in the US came as refugees. On any given day, about 40,000 people are
in immigration detention.
The numbers surrounding immigration can often be daunting and, sometimes, hard to track
down. In this session, we’ll go through some of the most useful data sets available — and talk
about some of the data that’s a bit tougher to find. We’ll talk about how to use that data to get
leads on local and national stories — and what to do when the government is not providing data
about its immigration actions.

(I wrote much of this chunk of numbers in part for a project at Global Nation. ​Check it out​!)
These numbers came from a lot of places and many of them were hard won, sometimes by
journalists but mostly by attorneys trying to represent their clients, and open government
advocates.
Data about immigration has never been easy. It’s not centralized. And, in our immigration
system, there aren’t the checks and public records of the criminal justice system. Many of the
battles that folks have won in the Obama administration, ​are now being fought a second time in
the Trump administration​. The Trump administration is stripping ICE of its reporting capacity,
and replacing any transparency they did have with at best incomplete reports, and at worst,
reports that are full of errors​ or are misleading.
(​Here’s a question I asked the Trump administration as part of a project we did at PRI in the first
100 days of his presidency​.)

With that preamble, let’s get started.
Children at the border. ​What happens to them? Let’s follow their journey through the US
immigration system.
Customs and Border Protection; their statistics are often used as a proxy for undocumented
immigration, particularly on the southern border. Remember that their numbers don’t include
everyone who crosses the border.

Terms: Apprehensions, Unaccompanied Minors (UAC), Family Units, Inadmissables
“Inadmissibles refers to individuals encountered at ports of entry who are seeking lawful
admission into the United States but are determined to be inadmissible, individuals presenting
themselves to seek humanitarian protection under our laws, and individuals who withdraw an
application for admission and return to their countries of origin within a short timeframe.”
“Apprehensions refers to the physical control or temporary detainment of a person who is not
lawfully in the U.S. which may or may not result in an arrest.”

Next, adults are arrested. ​Any criminal justice reporters here? Where would you go?
TRAC: Immigration prosecutions
Which court should I go hang out in? Where are these cases being prosecuted? Are the number
of convictions increasing?

Annual and quarterly reports to Congress are really telling. And one just came out on Thursday!
Who is getting contracts to care for families and children? How many children are released to
sponsors?
Now are they in foster care? Are they being reunited with parents ever? ​These are big
questions going forward. If they arrive alone, reuniting families isn’t always possible. But if the
government separates them and puts them on a UAC track, what are the mechanisms to bring
them back together?
Here’s one story of a boy that had a sponsor and ended up in the foster care system:

Do their cases end up in family courts? ​That’s the next step. Your state courts might have
data. The National Center for State Courts has aggregated information and data, and they are
very responsive to journalists who need help navigating things. In the past, family courts at the
state level have adjudicated immigration cases for juveniles, but now will there be custody
issues?
