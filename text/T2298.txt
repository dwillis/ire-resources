WASHINGTON’S PUBLIC DISCLOSURE ACT
The people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies
that serve them. The people, in delegating authority, do not give
their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people
to know and what is not good for them to know. The people insist on
remaining informed so that they may maintain control over the
instruments that they have created. The public records subdivision
of this chapter shall be liberally construed and its exemptions
narrowly construed to promote this public policy.
RCW 42.17.215.
Washington’s Public Disclosure Act (“PDA”) was adopted in 1972 by a direct vote of the people
of Washington and provides for broad rights of access to public records. The law requires all
records to be made available unless there is a specific exemption authorizing nondisclosure. The
burden of proof is on public agencies to demonstrate why a record should not be made available.
RCW 42.17.340(1).
The Washington Supreme Court described the PDA as follows:
It is a strongly worded mandate for broad public disclosure. While
mindful of the right of individuals to privacy and of the desirability
of the efficient administration of government, full access to
information concerning the conduct of government on every level
must be assured as a fundamental and necessary precondition to
the sound governance of a free society. The provisions of the act
are to be liberally construed to promote full access to public
records so as to assure continuing public confidence in
governmental processes, and to assure that the public interest will
be fully protected.
Spokane Police Guild v. Washington State Liquor Control Bd., 112 Wn.2d 30, 33 (1989). The
court further held that “[w]ithout tools such as the Public Records Act, government of the
people, by the people, for the people, risks becoming government of the people, by the
bureaucrats, for the special interests.” Progressive Animal Welfare Soc’y v. Univ. of
Washington, 125 Wn.2d 243, 251 (1995) (“PAWS”).
Despite this mandate, Washington’s record on access to public information is mixed.
Washington received an overall grade of C+ in a 50-state study on access to public records.

http://www.ire.org/fo1/bga/foiatable.html. In a 2001 statewide audit, dozens of employees at
local agencies violated state law by withholding documents the PDA says they must release.
Paula Lavigne Sullivan, “Open Access? Statewide Audit Finds Citizens May Have Difficulty
Accessing Information To Which They’re Entitled,” The Tacoma News Tribune, Oct. 21, 2001
(reprinted in Tri-City Herald “Your Right to Know” supplement, at 4 (December 2001)). In
certain instances, such as requests for information about property crimes, agencies illegally
denied requests for public documents more than 50 percent of the time. Id.
A.

WHAT RECORDS ARE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC?

The PDA applies to all state and local agencies. RCW 42.17.020(1). It does not apply to court
records; common law governs access to court records. Whether an entity is an “agency” is
determined by a four-factor test: “(1) whether the entity performs a governmental function;
(2) the level of government funding; (3) the extent of government involvement or regulation; and
(4) whether the entity was created by government.” Telford v. Thurston County Bd. of Comm’rs,
95 Wn. App. 149, 162 (1999).
A public record includes “any writing containing information relating to the conduct of
government or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function prepared, owned,
used, or retained by any state or local agency regardless of physical form or characteristics.”
RCW 42.17.020(36). A “writing” means any form of recorded communication or representation.
RCW 42.17.020(42). This includes electronic records. The definition of writing includes
“diskettes” and “existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or
translated.” RCW 42.17.020(42). If an agency is asked to produce an entire database, certain
material may be redacted to avoid releasing exempted material. The statute is not clear on how
agencies are to make data contained in an electronic record available, nor have the courts yet
provided guidance on this issue.
B.

HOW CAN ONE REQUEST A RECORD?

The PDA requires no particular form of request, though a person should “state the request with
sufficient clarity to give the agency fair notice that it ha[s] received a request for a public
record.” Wood v. Lowe, 102 Wn. App. 872, 878 (2000). Requests can be made in person or by
fax, phone, mail or e-mail. Making the request in writing helps provide a record of the request.
There is no need to show cause for a request. RCW 42.17.270; Mercer Island Sch. Dist. No. 400
v. Seattle Times Co., 28 Media L. Rep. (BNA) 2405 (King Cty. 2000). Agencies are not
permitted to distinguish among requesters. RCW 42.17.270.
Agencies are allowed to adopt reasonable procedures relating to records requests, but those
procedures must “provide for the fullest assistance to inquirers and the most timely possible
action on requests for information.” RCW 42.17.290. Public records must be available for
inspection during the agency’s regular office hours. RCW 42.17.280. If an agency is not

5-3

regularly open at least 30 hours a week, the records must be made available from 9 a.m. to noon
and 1 p.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Id.
Agencies are required to maintain an index of public records and provide this index upon
request. RCW 42.17.260. It is the agency’s responsibility to determine which records can be
legally withheld. RCW 42.17.340(1). Once an agency receives a request for a public record, the
agency has five business days to produce the record, deny the request or provide a reasonable
estimate of the additional time it will need to respond to the request. RCW 42.17.320. If a
requester asks to inspect a document and the agency has to make a copy so the requester can look
at it, the agency must bear the copying costs. If a person asks for a copy of a document, the
agency is required to either make a copy or provide copying facilities; the agency can charge for
the actual copying costs. RCW 42.17.260(7), .270. Agencies are required only to make existing
records accessible to the public; they are not required to explain public records or create records
that do not already exist. Smith v. Okanogan County, 100 Wn. App. 7, 12-14 (2000). If a
request is made for a public record that is scheduled for destruction, the agency may not destroy
the record until the request is resolved. RCW 42.17.290.
C.

WHAT IF AN AGENCY DENIES A REQUEST?

If an agency denies a request for public records, it must cite a specific legal exemption and
explain how that exemption applies to the request. RCW 42.17.310(4). If only a part of a record
contains information that is exempt from disclosure, the agency must produce everything that is
not exempt and must specifically identify what is being withheld and the legal reason why it is
being withheld. RCW 42.17.260(l), .310(2). An agency cannot deny disclosure based on the
fact that the requester can get the record by other means. Limstrom v. Ladenburg, 136 Wn.2d
595, 615 (1998) (plurality opinion) (citing Hearst Corp. v. Hoppe, 90 Wn.2d 123, 132 (1978)).
After an agency denies a request, it must conduct the most prompt possible review of the denial.
RCW 42.17.320. This review shall be deemed complete after two days and shall constitute final
agency action for the purposes of judicial review of the decision. Id. If a state agency denies a
request, the requester can appeal the denial directly to the Washington State Attorney General,
which will provide a written opinion about whether the record is exempt. RCW 42.17.325. An
Attorney General’s opinion is not binding on the state agency or the requester and does not
preclude a court appeal.
In response to a denial or unreasonable delay by an agency, the requester may file a lawsuit in
the Superior Court of the county where the record is located. RCW 42.17.340(1), (2). The
burden is on the agency to prove the record is exempt or that the delay in producing the record
was reasonable. Id. If the requester prevails in court, the agency must pay all of the requester’s
costs in connection with the legal action, including attorney’s fees. RCW 42.17.340(4). The
PDA also establishes a penalty of $5 to $100 per day for each day the agency denied the
requester the right to inspect or copy a public record. Id. The fine is for each record requested.
5-4

The statutory penalty must still be awarded even if the agency acted in good faith. King County
v. Sheehan, 57 P.3d 307 (Wash. App. Ct. Div. I, 2002). Delay and lack of “fullest assistance to
inquirers” alone justify an award of fees and statutory penalties. Doe I v. Washington State
Patrol, 80 Wn. App. 296, 303 (1996).
A court may order the nondisclosure of public records if such protection is requested by an
agency or a person named in the record. RCW 42.17.330. To issue such an order a court must
find that disclosure of the information is not in the public’s interest and release will substantially
and irreparably damage a person or vital governmental functions. Id.
D.

EXEMPTIONS TO THE PDA

Agencies are required to make all public records available for inspection or copying “unless the
record falls within the specific exemptions of subsection (6) of [42.17.260], 42.17.310,
42.17.315, or [some] other statute which exempts or prohibits disclosure of specific information
or records.” RCW 42.17.260(1). In addition to statutory exemptions permitting nondisclosure,
agencies are not authorized to “give; sell or provide access to lists of individuals requested for
commercial purposes ....” RCW 42.17.260(9). Although “commercial purpose” is not defined in
the PDA, the restriction in RCW 42.17.260(9) has been read broadly and interpreted to apply to
situations other than ones in which the requester intends to directly solicit individuals on the list.
AGO 1998 No. 2 (basing a broad reading of “commercial purpose” on the court’s broad reading
of RCW 42.17.310(1)(d) in Newman v. King County, 133 Wn.2d 565 (1997)). The restriction in
RCW 42.17.260(9), however, applies only to names of people, not corporations or other entities,
in list form. AGO 1975 No. 15.
Because the public policy behind the PDA is to favor disclosure, all exemptions are to be
narrowly construed. RCW 42.17.251; Hoppe, 90 Wn.2d at 128. The agency bears the burden of
proof to show that its refusal to allow access to public records “is in accordance with a statute
that exempts or prohibits disclosure in whole or in part of specific information or records.”
RCW 42.17.340(1).

EXEMPTIONS UNDER RCW 42.17.310

Counting the exemptions added in the 2002 legislative session, there are now 56 specific classes
of public records that are exempt under RCW 42.17.310(1). These exemptions are for the most
part permissive and not mandatory,1 thus an agency may waive an exemption if it chooses to do
so as long as no person’s privacy is violated by the disclosure. AGO 1980 No. 1. An agency
1

Specific exemptions that appear to be more mandatory than discretionary include RCW 42.17.310(1)(oo), dealing
with proprietary financial and commercial information submitted in connection with an antitrust exemption under
RCW 43.72.3 10, and 2002 Wash. Laws c. 224 § 2(aaa), which deals with the discharge papers of veterans of the
U.S. armed forces.

5-5

cannot be held liable “for any loss or damage based upon the release of a public record if the
[agency] acted in good faith.” RCW 42.17.258.
If an agency refuses to allow access to a public record, in whole or in part, the agency’s response
must point to the specific exemption that authorizes withholding the record and must include an
explanation of how the exemption applies to the record. RCW 42.17.310(4). None of the
exemptions allows an agency to withhold any statistical information that is “not descriptive of
any readily identifiable person or persons.” RCW 42.17.310(2). Furthermore, if information,
“the disclosure of which would violate personal privacy or vital governmental interests,” can be
redacted from a public record, then the agency must release the rest of the record after redacting
that information. Id.; Hoppe, 90 Wn.2d at 132. A person’s privacy is “invaded or violated only
if disclosure of information about the person: (1) Would be highly offensive to a reasonable
person, and (2) is not of legitimate concern to the public.” RCW 42.17.255 (codifying the
standard adopted in Hoppe, 90 Wn.2d at 135-36) (emphasis added). The agency must meet both
prongs of this test in order to withhold a record based on a claim that disclosure would violate a
person’s privacy. See Dawson, 120 Wn.2d at 797.2
No court decision has provided guidance on when a government interest is “vital” enough to
justify withholding a public record. However, agencies should not lose sight of the fact that the
Legislature chose the word “vital,” as opposed to “important,” an obvious alternate choice.
AGO 1976 No. 47.
Because RCW 42.17.310(1) contains 56 exemptions, not all of the exemptions are discussed in
this overview. What follows is a review of those exemptions that often arise in the context of
agency responses to PDA requests.
a.

Clients of State

RCW 42.17.310(1)(a) exempts from public inspection and copying:
Personal information in any files maintained for students in public
schools, patients or clients of public institutions or public health
agencies, or welfare recipients.
Although this exemption is not conditioned on a violation of anyone’s right to privacy, this is a
very narrow exemption. A patient cannot be denied access to his or her medical records held by
a public health care facility. Oliver v. Harborview Med. Ctr., 94 Wn.2d 559, 567 (1980).
Property owners who contract with a city for federal HUD funding are not “clients” of the city,
and their names and addresses are not “personal information.” Their names and addresses must

The test for “personal privacy” as codified in RCW 42.17.255 is discussed in greater detail in the section analyzing
RCW 42.17.310(l)(b).

be disclosed. Walla Walla UnionBulletin v. Walla Walla City Council, 7 Med. L. Rptr. 1858
(Walla Walla Cty. 1981). Furthermore, a retirement system created to benefit a group of public
employees is not a “public institution” because its services are not for the benefit of the general
public. Seattle Fire Fighters Union, Local No. 27 v. Hollister, 48 Wn. App. 129, 133 (1987),
rev. denied 108 Wn.2d 1033 (1987).
b.

Personal Information of Government Employees

RCW 42.17.310(1)(b) exempts from public inspection and copying:
Personal information in files maintained for employees,
appointees, or elected officials of any public agency to the extent
that disclosure would violate their right to privacy.
As with any exemption conditioned on the violation of a person’s privacy rights,3 this exemption
must be read in conjunction with RCW 42.17.255. Thus, this exemption only authorizes
withholding “private information” that “(1) would be highly offensive to a reasonable person,
and (2) is not of legitimate concern to the public.” RCW 42.17.255 (emphasis added). It is not
enough that disclosure of such personal information “may cause inconvenience or
embarrassment to public officials or others.” RCW 42.17.340(3).
Under RCW 42.17.255, “the use of a test that balances the individual’s privacy interest against
the interest of the public in disclosure is not permitted.” Dawson, 120 Wn.2d at 795 (citing
Brouillet v. Cowles Publ g Co., 114 Wn.2d 788, 798 (1990)). For disclosure to be of “legitimate
concern to the public” it must be reasonable. Id. at 798. A determination of whether disclosure
would be reasonable involves a balancing of “public interest in disclosure against the public
interest in the ‘efficient administration of government.’” Id. (citing RCW 42.17.010(11)). The
burden is on the agency to show that public interest weighs in favor of withholding the public
record. See Id.
It is not necessary that the information come from the employee’s personnel file in order for
personal information to fall under (1)(b). See Tacoma Pub. Library v. Woessner, 90 Wn. App.
205, 216-17 (1998). The focus is on whether the information is normally maintained for the
employee’s benefit and whether disclosure would violate the employee’s right to privacy. Id.
at 217.
Courts have not explicitly listed what information is covered by Exemption (1)(b). There are
specific, separate exemptions for public employees’ residential addresses or residential telephone
numbers, RCW 42.17.310(1)(u), and resumes, RCW 42.17.310(1)(t). Courts have held that
Social Security numbers should not be released. PAWS, 125 Wn.2d at 254. Names of applicants

Other such exemptions include RCW 42.17.310(1)(c) & (d).

5-7

for public employment are exempt, RCW 42.17.310(1)(t), but names of those actually employed
as public employees are not exempt. Sheehan, 57 P.3d 307; see also Tacoma Pub. Library v.
Woessner, 90 Wn. App. 205, 224 (1998).
Information concerning intimate details of the public employee’s private life may satisfy the first
part of the two-part test to determine whether disclosure would violate a person’s right to
privacy. Yakima Newspapers, Inc. v. City of Yakima, 77 Wn. App. 319, 327 (1995). “Sexual
relations, for example, are normally entirely private matters, as are family quarrels, many
unpleasant or disgraceful or humiliating illnesses, most intimate personal letters, most details of
a man’s life in his home, and some of his past history that he would rather forget.” Hoppe, 90
Wn.2d at 136 (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts § 652D (1977)); see also Tiberino v.
Spokane County, 103 Wn. App. 680 (2000) (exempting personal e-mail messages sent from
work). Information related to an employee’s disability would not be highly offensive to a
reasonable person and thus not exempt, unless it is of a humiliating or disgraceful nature. Seattle
Fire Fighters Union, 48 Wn. App. at 135-36.
“[D]isclosure of performance evaluations, which do not discuss specific instances of misconduct,
is presumed to be highly offensive within the meaning of RCW 42.17.255.” Dawson, 120
Wn.2d at 797. This, however, only goes to the first prong of the two-prong test under
RCW 42.17.255. Thus, if the records are of legitimate public concern, then the public record is
not exempt. See Spokane Research & Defense Fund v. City of Spokane, 99 Wn. App. 452, 457
(2000) (requiring disclosure of an evaluation of the City Manager carried out by the Spokane
City Council because “the City Council used this information in making its determination to
retain the City Manager,” thus making the evaluation of legitimate public interest). Disclosure of
public records that discuss specific instances of misconduct does not violate a public employee’s
right to privacy. See Columbian Publ’g Co. v. City of Vancouver, 36 Wn. App. 25, 29-30 (1983)
(police officers’ comments regarding specific complaints about the police chief are not exempt).
Unsubstantiated claims may not rise to the level of specific instances of misconduct. City of
Tacoma v. Tacoma News, Inc., 65 Wn. App. 140, 148-49 (1992). However, “information about
public, on-duty job performances should be disclosed.” Ollie v. Highland Sch. Dist. 203, 50 Wn.
App. 639, 645 (1988).
c.

Taxpayer Information

RCW 42.17.310(1)(c) exempts from public inspection and copying:
Information required of any taxpayer in connection with the
assessment or collection of any tax if the disclosure of the
information to other persons would (i) be prohibited to such
persons by RCW 84.08.210, 82.32.330, 84.40.020, or 84.40.340 or
(ii) violate the taxpayer’s right to privacy or result in unfair
competitive disadvantage to the taxpayer.
5-8

This provision does not exempt disclosure of information related to the market value of property
used by the Assessor’s office since disclosure would not be highly offensive to a reasonable
person. Hoppe, 90 Wn.2d at 138.
d.

Investigative Information

RCW 42.17.310(l)(d) exempts from public inspection and copying:
Specific intelligence information and specific investigative records
compiled by investigative, law enforcement, and penology
agencies, and state agencies vested with the responsibility to
discipline members of any profession, the nondisclosure of which
is essential to effective law enforcement or for the protection of
any person’s right to privacy.
This exemption applies only to specific intelligence information and specific investigative
records that are compiled by investigative, law enforcement or penology agencies or state
agencies charged with disciplining members of a profession and then only if the agency can
demonstrate that withholding the records is essential to effective law enforcement or to protect
someone’s right to privacy.
Public records are “`specific investigative records’ if they were ‘compiled as a result of a specific
investigation focusing with special intensity upon a particular party.’” Dawson, 120 Wn.2d at
792-93 (quoting Laborers Int’l Union of North America, Local 374 v. City of Aberdeen, 31 Wn.
App. 445, 448 (1982)). The investigation “must be ‘one designed to ferret out criminal activity
or to shed light on some other allegation of malfeasance.’” Dawson, 120 Wn.2d at 793 (quoting
City of Vancouver, 36 Wn. App. at 31). But see Cowles Publ’g Co. v. Pierce County
Prosecutor’s Office, 111 Wn. App. 502, 507-08 (2002) (mitigation package submitted to the
prosecutor’s office as part of the prosecutor’s investigation into whether to seek the death penalty
is an investigative report even though it was not designed to “ferret out” criminal activity). The
investigation need not be one leading to criminal sanctions. Ames v. City of Fircrest, 71 Wn.
App. 284, 294 (1993) (internal investigation of law enforcement officer by law enforcement
agency).
This exemption applies only if “nondisclosure ... is essential to effective law enforcement or for
the protection of any person’s right to privacy.”4 RCW 42.17.310(1)(d); Cowles Publ’g Co. v.
State Patrol, 109 Wn.2d 712, 728 (1988). It applies only to ongoing investigations. Ashley v.
Washington State Pub. Disclosure Comm’n, 16 Wn. App. 830 (1977). However, “names of
persons reflected on the record of [completed] internal investigations” may be withheld because
the internal investigation process is essential to effective law enforcement and officers may be
4

See the subsection on RCW 42.17.310(1)(b) for a discussion of the right to privacy.

5-9

less than candid without the promise of confidentiality. State Patrol, 109 Wn.2d at 733. If the
identity of the officer who was the subject of the internal investigation is known from other
sources, nondisclosure is not essential to effective law enforcement, and the exemption does not
apply. Ames, 71 Wn. App. at 296; cf. State v. Jones, 96 Wn. App. 369, 381-82 (1999) (allowing
the defendant in a criminal trial access to a police department’s internal shooting review board
report because it was not “the public at large” that had requested the internal file and because
public disclosure of the report could be prevented “through the imposition of appropriate
discovery control”).
If the investigation is open and is leading toward enforcement proceedings, then all parts of the
investigative file compiled by law enforcement agencies may be exempt, without consideration
of whether the records are available elsewhere. Newman v. King County, 133 Wn.2d 565, 57273 (1997). “In determining if an investigation is leading toward an enforcement proceeding, the
... courts examine (1) ‘affidavits by people with direct knowledge of and responsibility for the
investigation . . .’; (2) whether resources are allocated to the investigation; and (3) whether
enforcement proceedings are contemplated.” Id. at 573 (citing Dickerson v. Dep’t. of Justice, 992
F.2d 1426, 1431-32 (6th Cir. 1993)). Newman should not be read, however, as a categorical
exemption of all `open’ police investigations. Cowles Publ’g Co. v. Spokane Police Dep’t, 139
Wn.2d 472, 477 (1999). The Newman court was “concerned both with the difficulty police
would have segregating information in unsolved cases, and with the propriety of charging courts
with the responsibility of determining whether nondisclosure was critical to solving the case ....”
Spokane Police Dep’t, 139 Wn.2d at 477. However, if “the suspect has already been arrested
and the matter referred to the prosecutor for a charging decision ... the risk of inadvertently
disclosing sensitive information that might impede apprehension of the perpetrator no longer
exists,” and thus the exemption would not apply. Id. at 477-78.
e.

(h) Research Data

RCW 42.17.310(l)(h) exempts from public inspection and copying:
Valuable formulae, designs, drawings, computer source code or
object code, and research data obtained by any agency within five
years of the request for disclosure when disclosure would produce
private gain and public loss.
This exemption is designed “to prevent private persons from using the Act to appropriate
potentially valuable intellectual property for private gain.” PAWS, 125 Wn.2d at 255. The PDA
“protects recently acquired intellectual property from being converted to private gain.” Id. In
order for this exemption to apply, the agency must show that disclosure would lead to both
private gain and public loss. Spokane Research & Defense Fund v. City of Spokane, 96 Wn.
App. 568, 576 (1999) (citing Servais v. Port of Bellingham, 127 Wn.2d 820, 823 (1995); PAWS,
125 Wn.2d at 255). Where an agency fails to show that any public loss would flow from
5-10

disclosure, records are not exempt under Exemption (1)(h). Spokane Research & Defense Fund,
96 Wn. App. at 576-77.
f.

Deliberative Process

RCW 42.17.310(l)(i) exempts from public inspection and copying:
Preliminary drafts, notes, recommendations, and intra-agency
memorandums in which opinions are expressed or policies
formulated or recommended except that a specific record shall not
be exempt when publicly cited by an agency in connection with
any agency action.
The purpose of this exemption is to protect an agency’s deliberative process, and this purpose
“severely limits its scope.” Hoppe, 90 Wn.2d at 133. In order for intra-agency documents to be
exempt:
an agency must show that the records contain predecisional
opinions or recommendations of subordinates expressed as part of
a deliberative process; that disclosure would be injurious to the
deliberative or consultative function of the process; that disclosure
would inhibit the flow of recommendations, observations, and
opinions; and ... that the materials covered by the exemption reflect
policy recommendations and opinions and not the raw factual data
on which a decision is based.
PAWS, 125 Wn.2d at 256 (citing Columbian Publ’g Co., 36 Wn. App. at 31-32).
This exemption affords protection “only until the policies or recommendations contained in the
requested documents have been implemented.” Dawson, 120 Wn.2d at 793; see also PAWS, 125
Wn.2d at 257. The Washington Supreme Court has “specifically rejected” the argument that this
exemption applies “to all documents in which opinions are expressed. ...” PAWS, 125 Wn.2d at
256. Records are not exempt unless the opinions expressed in those records relate to policy
formulation. Id. at 256. Records that concern implementing policy instead of making policy are
not exempt. Brouillet, 114 Wn.2d at 790.
The exemption does not apply to facts or raw data. Factual data, even if contained in a record
otherwise exempt under RCW 42.17.310(1)(i), must be released. Hoppe, 90 Wn.2d at 133. If an
agency treats subjective opinions as factual material then those opinions are not exempt. Id. at
134; see also Overlake Fund v. City of Bellevue, 60 Wn. App. 787, 794 n.5 (1991) (evaluation of
property site was not exempt under (1)(i) because it was not part of the city’s policy-making
process and appeared to “contain a certain amount of factual data”).

Work-Product

RCW 42.17.310(1)(j) exempts from public inspection and copying:
Records which are relevant to a controversy to which an agency is
a party but which records would not be available to another party
under the rules of pretrial discovery for causes pending in the
superior courts.
This exemption allows an agency to withhold information that it would be able to withhold from
discovery under the civil rules for superior courts, CR 26, even if the request is for records
created in a criminal proceeding. Limstrom, 136 Wn.2d at 609; cf. O’Connor v. Department of
Soc. & Health Servs., 143 Wn.2d 895, 906-07 (2001) (looking to CR 26 in a civil case).
“[P]ublic records from a public agency available to litigants against the agency by discovery
under the Civil Rules are not exempt from the [PDA] under RCW 43.17.310(1)(j). The Civil
Rules do not conflict with the [PDA].” O’Connor, 143 Wn.2d at 910. In particular, “records
[are] not exempt if they are available to another party under superior court rules of pretrial
discovery.” Id. at 912.
Under CR 26, documents that contain “the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal
theories of an attorney or other representative of a party concerning the litigation” have absolute
immunity. These documents may always be withheld under RCW 42.17.310(1)(j). However,
other trial preparation material is discoverable “upon a showing that the party seeking discovery
has substantial need of the materials in the preparation of his case and that he is unable without
undue hardship to obtain the substantial equivalent of the materials by other means.” CR 26.
Thus, if any party to litigation against the agency would be able to meet this test and discover the
material, then the agency cannot rely on this exemption to withhold the material.
The work product must relate to a specific “controversy,” which is “defined as completed,
existing, or reasonably anticipated litigation.” Dawson, 120 Wn.2d at 791. It is not necessary
that the person seeking public records be a party to the completed, existing or reasonably
anticipated litigation. If a party to litigation against the agency could discover the public record
sought, the agency must release it to anyone, including the litigant, making a request for public
records under the PDA. See, e.g., O’Connor, 143 Wn.2d at 912.
h.

Response Plans and Vulnerability Assessments

RCW 42.17.310(1)(ww) exempts from public inspection and copying:
Those portions of records assembled, prepared, or maintained to
prevent, mitigate, or respond to criminal terrorist acts, which are
acts that significantly disrupt the conduct of government or of the

5-12

general civilian population of the state or the United States and that
manifest an extreme indifference to human life, the public
disclosure of which would have a substantial likelihood of
threatening public safety, consisting of.•
(i) Specific and unique vulnerability assessments or
specific and unique response or deployment plans,
including compiled underlying data collected in preparation
of or essential to the assessments, or to the response or
deployment plans; and
(ii) Records not subject to public disclosure under federal
law that are shared by federal or international agencies, and
information prepared from national security briefings
provided to state or local government officials related to
domestic preparedness for acts of terrorism.
The Legislature approved an earlier version of this exemption before the events of September 11,
2001. The final version reflects revisions made in the wake of September 11.
2.

OTHER EXEMPTIONS CONTAINED IN RCW 42.17

Although the exemptions in RCW 42.17.310(1) are the most commonly cited exemptions to
disclosure under the PDA, there are 25 other specific exemptions included in RCW 42.17.312 .31917. These exemptions cover a variety of documents, ranging from gifts to universities to
proprietary information provided to the insurance commissioner.
Of these exemptions, the only one with any developed case law is RCW 42.17.314. This
exemption prohibits law enforcement agencies from requesting inspection of a person’s electrical
utility records without a written statement that the agency suspects that the person has committed
a crime and that access to the records will help the agency determine whether the suspicion is
true. It does not prohibit a public utility district from voluntarily disclosing information to law
enforcement agencies. State v. Maxfield, 125 Wn.2d 378, 392 (1994).
3.

EXEMPTIONS UNDER OTHER STATUTES

Through RCW 42.17.260(1), the PDA incorporates “other statute[s] which exempt[] or prohibit[]
disclosure of specific information or records.” Among these statutes are those addressing:
a.

Criminal Records

State and local agencies can release conviction records. RCW 10.97.050(1). Records relating to
investigations not leading to a conviction may be disclosed for certain criminal justice and
5-13

research purposes but may not be retained or reproduced by individuals unless it is to challenge
inaccurate information. RCW 10.97.050,.080. The Court of Appeals has held that all state
agencies—not just criminal justice agencies - are prohibited from disseminating non-conviction
information. Beltran v. Department of Soc. & Health Servs., 98 Wn. App. 245, 260-61 (1999).
It is important to note that while RCW 10.97.080 prohibits retaining or mechanically
reproducing non-conviction data, the statutory language does not preclude viewing such
information. Hudgens v. Renton, 49 Wn. App. 842, 844-45 (1987).
b.

Jail Records

Each officer responsible for a jail is required to keep a jail register open to the public with each
inmate’s name and time and cause of confinement. RCW 70.48.100(1). Records of a person
confined in jail are to be held in confidence, however, except for certain uses by criminal justice
agencies. RCW 70.48.100(2). Booking photographs can be used in conducting investigations of
crimes or disseminating information about sex offenders but otherwise cannot be released by a
jail or other law enforcement agency. RCW 70.48.100; Spokane Police Dept., 139 Wn.2d at
480-81.
c.

Traffic Accident Reports

RCW 46.52.0801 provides that “required accident reports” will be for the confidential use of the
prosecuting attorney, law enforcement officials and people having a proper interest in this
information, such as the drivers, injured persons or their representatives. The Washington
Supreme Court has interpreted this statute to mean that accident reports prepared by people
involved in the accident are exempt from public disclosure but that reports prepared by law
enforcement officials are still subject to public disclosure under RCW 42.17. Guillen v. Pierce
County, 144 Wn.2d 696, 714-715 (2001), cert. granted, 122 S. Ct. 1788 (2002) (No. 01-1229).
Even accident reports exempt from public disclosure may still be subject to discovery under the
Rules of Civil Procedure. Id. at 702.
d.

Medical Records

The Health Care Information Access and Disclosure Act generally prohibits health care
providers from disclosing a patient’s health care information without the patient’s authorization.
RCW 70.02.020. The statute defines health care information as “any information, whether oral
or recorded in any form or medium, that Identifies or can readily be associated with the identity
of a patient and directly relates to the patient’s health care.” RCW 70.02.010(6). Exceptions to
the prohibition on disclosure are for health care, research or administrative reasons if the
information is safeguarded from further disclosure. RCW 70.02.050. An attorney seeking
discovery of health care information must give the health care provider and the patient 14 days
notice before service of a discovery request or compulsory notice. RCW 70.02.060.

5-14

Few cases have interpreted the act and its relation to the PDA. In Doe v. Group Health
Cooperative, the Court of Appeals found that a jury could find that disclosure in a training
exercise of an employee’s name, consumer number and mental health treatment history
constituted disclosure of protected health care information. 85 Wn. App. 21:3, 218-19 (1997).
It is noteworthy that the medical privacy provisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) preempt state law except where the state law privacy
provisions are more stringent than federal law. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-191, Aug. 21, 1996, 110 Stat. 1936);,46 C.F.R. § 160.202-.205.
Exceptions are allowed for state provisions that meet certain criteria. Id. The recently enacted
HIPAA privacy rules prohibit dissemination and publication of any individually identifiable
health information regardless of the public interest in that information.
e.

Trade Secrets

The Washington State Uniform Trade Secrets Act defines a trade secret as information that
derives independent economic value from not being generally known and is the subject of
reasonable efforts to maintain its secrecy. RCW 19.108.010(4). The information has to be novel
and not readily ascertainable from another source, and the party claiming the exemption has the
burden of proving that the information is a trade secret. Spokane Research & Defense Fund, 96
Wn. App. at 577-78. While the Supreme Court described the PDA as an “improper means to
acquire knowledge of a trade secret,” the court also held that “in the event of a conflict between
the [PDA] and other statutes, the provisions of the [PDA] govern. PAWS, 125 Wn.2d at 262
(citing RCW 42.17.920).
Given these guidelines, courts have been hesitant to exempt trade secrets. In Confederated
Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation v. Johnson, Washington’s ‘Supreme Court held that records
relating to contributions under tribal state gaming compacts contained information that was
already ascertainable through other means and that the information did not derive “independent
economic value” from not being generally known. 135 Wn.2d 734, 749-50 (1998). Similarly, a
lease, pro formas and other documents used to perform credit and financial analysis were not
considered novel - and thus not trade secrets - especially when created for a public entity.
Spokane Research & Defense Fund, 96 Wn. App. at 578; see also Buffets, Inc. v. Klinke, 73 F.3d
965 (9th Cir. 1996).
ACCESS TO RECORDS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
By Bruce E. H. Johnson
A.

Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) – Summary

5-15

1.
You should try to obtain federal records in formation informally, but if you are
refused or if the agency requests that you use its regular procedures, you should use the FOIA,
5 U.S.C. § 552, to obtain access to federal government records.
2.
The FOIA applies to “federal agencies,” which includes any entity in the
executive branch, the military departments, government corporations or any independent
regulatory agency, i.e., the FCC or the ICC. It requires those agencies to show you their
“records” and allow you to copy them. “Records” include tapes, microfilm and, broadly, any
means of collecting information (although access to computer data is debatable). All records
which the agency possesses or controls (even if it didn’t prepare them) are covered.
3.
The agency can refuse to provide “records” if the records are “exempt” from
disclosure under at least one of nine specific exemptions, but it must provide to you “any
reasonably segregable portion” of the record which remains after the “exempt” portion is
removed.
4.
The FOIA provides a series of deadlines which the agency must meet in
responding to your request. By law, federal agencies have 10 business days in which to respond
to public records requests. As a practical matter, however, long waits for federal public records
are commonplace. The Clinton administration has directed federal agencies to concentrate on
reducing the backlog of requests and filing requests within a 10-day period. Unfortunately
certain agencies are still notorious for delays. The FOIA gives you rights of appeal, both within
the agency and to the courts.
B.

Requesting Information Under the FOIA

1.
Find out as much as you can about the records you are seeking and the agency
procedures before you make a formal written request. Most agencies will have a FOIA “officer”
who will be the best source of information on FOIA request procedures, the costs of search and
copying and the filing system of the agency. You can speak to that officer without specifying in
advance the nature of your request, or look in the Federal Register or regulations at the public
library for the agency’s procedures. Following the agency’s FOIA rules will speed up the
response to your request.
2.
Be as specific as possible when you make your request. Your request must
“reasonably describe” the records you seek. Being specific will expedite the handling of your
request.
3.
You don’t have to give the agency any information about who you are or the
reason for your request, although you may wish to do so because your status will determine how
much the agency can charge you. Federal agencies charge non-media, non-academic requestors

5-16

search fees in addition to copying costs. If the disclosure you seek is “primarily benefiting the
public,” the agency has discretionary power to grant a waiver of search and copying costs.
C.

Agency Refusal to Disclose Under the Exemptions
Any agency may refuse to give you either all or a part of the following:

1.
Records specifically authorized under certain criteria established by an executive
order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and must be in fact
properly classified pursuant to such executive order;
2.

Records related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency;

3.
Records specifically exempted from disclosure by statute, provided such statute
requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion
on the issue, or establishes by particular criteria the types of matters to be withheld;
4.
Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and
privileged or confidential;
5.
Inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be
available by law to a party in litigation with the agency;
(a)

An agency document may lose its internal status and hence its FOIA exemption
by its use in external dealings with the general public or regulated groups.

(b)

Agency attorney “work product” materials (i.e., materials prepared by an attorney
in anticipation of litigation or trial) are exempt.5

6.
Personnel and medical files and similar files, the disclosure of which would
constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;

5
6

(a)

A tape recording of voice communications (as opposed to typewritten transcript)
aboard the space shuttle “Challenger” prior to its explosion is private;6

(b)

With regard to records relating to the performance by government employees of
their official duties, recent cases have indicated that the public interest in
monitoring the behavior of public officials outweighs personal privacy interest
when the records sought reveal individual abuses of official positions, but not

FTC v. Grolier, 462 U.S. 19 (1983).
U.S. Dept. of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989).

5-17

when the records pertain to positive performance evaluations of government
employees.7
7.
Investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the
extent that the production of such records would
(a)

interfere with enforcement proceedings,

(b)

deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication,

(c)

constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy (release of FBI rap sheets
is unwarranted invasion of privacy because computers can store and accumulate
information that would otherwise be forgotten;8 but disclosure of the names of
individuals in corporations receiving “notice letters” as part of the EPA’s
Superfund hazardous-waste cleanup program, and which concerned recipients’
possible responsibility for hazardous-waste material, is not unwarranted invasion
of privacy or exempt for any other reasons),9

(d)

disclose the identity of a confidential source and, in the case of a record compiled
by a criminal-law-enforcement authority in the course of a criminal-law
investigation or by an agency conducting a lawful national-security intelligence
investigation, confidential information furnished only by the confidential source
(for example, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that unsworn confidential
statements made to Air Force air crash safety investigators are exempt under
FOIA),

(e)

disclose investigative techniques and procedures, or

(f)

endanger the life or physical safety of law-enforcement personnel.

8.
Reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the
regulation or supervision of financial institutions; or
9.

Geological and geophysical information and data, including maps, concerning

wells.
7

Compare Stern v. FBI (name of high-level FBI employee who was found to have participated, deliberately and
knowingly, in withholding of damaging information in investigation of illegal FBI activities not exempt), with
Ripskis v. Department of Housing & Urban Development, 9 Media L. Rep. 1996 (D.D.C. 1983) (names and other
identifying information of department employees receiving “outstanding” performance ratings, exempt to protect
personal privacy).
8
Cohen v. EPA, 575 F. Supp. 425 (D.D.C. 1983).
9
U.S. v. Weber Aircraft Corp., 465 U.S. 792 (1984).

5-18

Attorney General Janet Reno had instructed federal agencies not to invoke these
exemptions unless disclosure will result in a “foreseeable harm.” (Her Bush Administration
successor, Attorney General Ashcroft, has taken a very different attitude since October 2001 –
and has adopted the standard that exemptions from disclosure should be claimed if there as a
“sound legal basis” for doing so.)
If you believe, based on your informal contacts, that the agency may refuse to give you
records based on one or more of these exemptions, you should contact your lawyer for help in
drafting the request in order to prepare for later appeals. If an agency does, in fact, refuse to
disclose records, you should contact your lawyer for help in preparing the appeal.
A refusal to disclose is to be accompanied by an explanation of the basis for refusal and
the agency’s internal procedures for review.
The FOIA provides for extensions of the 10-day response period if records must be
collected from separate offices or are voluminous, or if the agency must consult with another
agency on your request. The agency must give you its reason for this extension.
D.

Appeal From an Agency Refusal

1.
If the agency does not respond within the 10 days, you may consider your request
denied and begin an appeal. However, this probably will not help unless you know already that
the agency intends to refuse or “stonewall” your request. The agency may merely explain that it
is exercising due diligence, and you may create unnecessary antagonism. If the agency delays, a
good approach would be to write a letter asking the appropriate person (perhaps the FOIA
officer) to tell you when you will receive a response. Mention your right of appeal.
2.
If the agency refuses your request or if it is apparent that it will not answer, you
may appeal to an internal agency tribunal. This step is a necessary prerequisite to filing suit. An
agency denial of your request will tell you how long you have to appeal, usually less than a
month. If you are serious about pursuing your request, you should involve your lawyer at this
point to help prepare an adequate basis for appeal to court. Again, you should follow carefully
the agency procedures or forms for appeal and should point out the exemption being relied upon
and the greater public benefit that would outweigh the harm from disclosure. The agency
tribunal must make a determination of your appeal within 20 business days.
3.
If the agency denies your appeal, you may want to appeal to the courts. You
probably already will have worked with your lawyer by this time, so you should be ready to file
a court complaint quickly challenging the agency denial. Another option would be to negotiate
with the agency for an acceptable alternative, such as an excerpt, summary or interview. You
should make the agency aware that you will go to the courts; you might even show the agency a
copy of your complaint and supporting memos to convince its staff of your position.

5-19

4.
You may file your complaint in a federal district court where you reside or do
business, in the district where the records are located or in the District of Columbia.
A court may award you reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs of litigation if you
have “substantially prevailed.” However, a court will grant such relief only if it believes you
have acted reasonably and for the public benefit. Careful documentation of all your actions in
letters sent to the agency will help you show your reasonableness and the agency’s unnecessary
delays.
ACCESS TO MEETINGS OF
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
A.

The Sunshine Act -- Summary

1.
The Sunshine Act, codified at 5 U.S.C. § 522b, requires agencies to give notice of
their meetings to the public and to hold open meetings unless the agency decides a meeting
should be closed under one of the exemptions defined by the act.
2.
The act applies only to executive department agencies or to their subdivisions. It
is narrowed further to apply only when a quorum of the agency body is present and when that
body has the power to conduct or decide official agency business, and is doing so. Practically,
only formal, policy- or decision-making meetings are covered, and an informal or advisory group
meeting need not be open.
3.
Notice of meetings must be published at least one week in advance in the Federal
Register. This may be of some help if you read the Register every day, but you would be better
advised to contact the agency information officer or other relevant personnel to keep apprised of
meetings that are important to you.
Always check to see if you will need a particular document for reference at the meeting
and move to obtain the document informally and quickly. Otherwise, some meetings will be
meaningless.
B.

When the Agency Closes the Meeting

1.
The agency must follow specific procedures if it wants to close a meeting, part of
a meeting or a series of meetings covered by the act. A majority of the members in charge of the
meeting must vote to close the meeting. The voting record of those members, an explanation for
closing the meeting and the list of people who were expected to attend must be published the
next day.
2.
The agency may decide in advance to close the meeting, or it may be closed upon
the motion of an agency member or a participating party. You may object to closure if you
5-20

believe closure is occurring for the wrong reasons, or if the agency follows incorrect procedures.
If possible, make sure the vote and reasons for it are recorded.
3.
The act has 10 exemptions from the requirement for open meetings. Seven of the
exemptions apply to the same subject matters as for the FOIA. The others:
(a)

An agency meeting to accuse someone of a crime or formally censure someone;

(b)

An agency meeting which would prematurely disclose information that would:

(c)
C.

(i)

be likely to lead to financial speculation in currencies, securities or
commodities or significantly endanger the stability of any financial
institutions; or

(ii)

be likely to significantly frustrate implementation of proposed agency
action, i.e., by warning someone of action that will affect him or her
adversely.

An agency meeting specifically concerning issuance of a subpoena, participation
in a civil or foreign judicial proceeding or a formal agency adjudication.

Limits on Closed Meetings

1.
exemption.

The agency may not close all of a meeting if only part of the meeting fits an

2.
The agency must keep transcripts of closed meetings and must give you copies of
the transcript with appropriate deletions for the exempt portions. You may have to make an
FOIA request for such a transcript.
3.
You may challenge closure immediately in federal district court if improper
procedures were followed in deciding to close the meeting or if the meeting did not come under
one of the 10 exemptions. You should consult your editor and lawyer immediately if you believe
either has occurred.
(a)

If a decision to close is made before the meeting, the court may stop the meeting.

(b)

If the meeting has been held, you may challenge closure and obtain the copy of
the transcript without deletions if the meeting was improperly closed.

(c)

The court may award you attorneys’ fees and costs if you prevail. On the other
hand, the court may assess the government’s fees and costs against you if you
initiated the lawsuit “for primarily frivolous or dilatory purposes.” Thus you
5-21

should consult your lawyer fully and carefully investigate the closure before you
bring such a lawsuit.
(d)

The challenge may be filed in the federal district where the meeting was held,
where the agency has its headquarters, or in Washington, D.C.
