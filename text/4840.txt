Many cases involve minor charges that did not
result in a conviction.
Scores of cases do not mention an arrest.
NYPD nearly always starts cases with request for
ex parte closing order.
Judges signed them more than 70% of time.
Allegations were, on average, six months old.
Occupants often agreed to move out or ban
specific family members for life.
Occupants often agreed to police surveillance,
further erosion of due process rights, etc.

Advantages to collecting my own data:
●

NYPD terrible about
public records requests.

●

They didn’t track what I
wanted to track.

●

Gained a deeper
understanding of a
complex area of law. Saw
patterns I might have
otherwise missed.

●

Found shocking
examples for my story.

Had experts on call. Did
a significant portion of

●

Enter birthdays instead of age.
Enter whole dates, then run calculations on the dates.
Enter addresses very neatly and create separate columns
for unit numbers.
Don’t leave blanks, enter “Unknown” or “N/A”.
Make separate columns for each thing you want to track.
Do not combine multiple factors into one column (i.e.
lists).
Create columns for notes, sources, to-dos.

Data validation and proofing:
●

●
●
●
●

Verification is optimal but not always possible due to
time and budget constraints.
Proofed every field and blurb that would be displayed to
readers multiple times.
For fields that would only be shown as aggregated
results, I did random proofing and validation.
Sent both spreadsheets to the NYPD well in advance of
publication.
Made data public.
Published methodology.
