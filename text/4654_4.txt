Csvkit on your own machine
If you're installing this library onto your own linux, OSX or virtual machine then here are some instructions to help get you
going.
For those of you who would like to install and run csvkit on their own machines, you can install it easily for linux or OSX
operating systems.
If you run windows, never fear, you can install virtual box and run a linux enviroment from there.

Getting going
You need python 2.7 or 3.3 installed.
You can install csvkit using the following commands, depending on what package manager you're using:
$ pip install csvkit
or
$ conda install csv
or
$ sudo apt‐get install csvkit
If you have any problms check out csvkit's documentation at https://csvkit.readthedocs.org/en/0.9.1/install.html

Navigating and reading in data
So unlike python anywhere you need to be able to make folders on the command line
Open a terminal and type pwd to make sure you're in your home directory
Now we need to make a new folder to contain our work ‐ type: $ mkdir csvkit
The next move is to navigate into the folder, to do this we use cd which lets us change directory
$ cd csvkit
To check the folder is empty we type ls this checks the contents of a folder.
