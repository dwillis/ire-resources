THE BASICS
 Federal contracting spending more than
doubled to about $541 billion from fiscal 2001
to 2008.
 Spending leveled off under Obama, and then
plunged last year.

 In fiscal 2013, the federal government spent
$460 billion on contracts.
 Most of that is military spending.

BEFORE THE AWARD..
 A contracting officer for the agency generally
puts out a Request for Proposal (an RFP).
 And then companies compete for the work.

FBO.GOV

CLICK BOTH “ACTIVE” & “ARCHIVED”

SMALL BUSINESSES
 The government has a goal of awarding 23%
of contracts to small businesses per year.
 Sometimes contracting officers set aside
contract money for small businesses or
minority small businesses. These set-asides
generally require less competition.
 If you want to look up small business
contractors by state or industry:

THE LOSERS

PROTESTS
 Direct agency protests (Most opaque, usually
requires FOIA)
 Government Accountability Office (GAO)
protests (GAO.gov)

 Lawsuits at the Court of Federal Claims
(PACER)

GAO PROTESTS,
GAO.GOV

THE LOSING BIDS

SUSPENSION/DEBARMENT
 System for Award Management (SAM):
https://www.sam.gov/portal/SAM/##11

 Suspended contractors cannot win new
contracts.
 However, they can continue work on existing
contracts.

STATE AND LOCAL
 There is no comprehensive, centralized
database of state and/or local contracts.
