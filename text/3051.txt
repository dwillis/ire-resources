OVERVIEW
Reporters wishing to obtain transportation data in Canada do not have the same
ease of access to raw data that is available in the United States. Canada’s main
aviation regulator, Transport Canada, has been reluctant to provide access to the
many datasets it keeps, many of which contain essentially the same information
available online from such U.S. sources as the FAA and Bureau of
Transportation Statistics. That said, creative reporters can obtain much of the
data they need. Here are some sources.
INCIDENT DATA
After a four-year battle with The Hamilton Spectator that ended on the steps of
the federal court, Transport Canada relented and allowed access to its CADORS
database of aviation incidents, similar to the U.S. accident and incident data. The
database is based on preliminary reports of incidents in Canadian airspace and
Canadian-controlled oceanic airspace involving Canadian and foreign aircraft. It
also records incidents that occurred on the ground, such as failures of navigation
equipment. Most of the reports originate with Nav Canada, the non-profit
company that runs the air traffic control system in Canada. Other reports come
from airlines, the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, the public and other
sources. It is important to realize that the data are preliminary and may contain
some errors. As the dataset is incident-based, it should not be considered to
provide a comprehensive picture of any issue. That said, this is a rich dataset
that was the basis for the joint Spectator/Toronto Star/Record of Waterloo Region
series Collision Course (http://blogs.ukings.ca/carincanada/2006/06/14/collisioncourse/).
CADORS is available online at
http://www.tc.gc.ca/aviation/applications/cadors/splash.htm in a searchable
format that returns an html report. It becomes tedious to use if you are searching
for a great many incidents. You can also obtain the raw dataset from King’s;

SERVICE DIFFICULTY REPORTS (SDRs)
Service difficulty reports are, according to the Canadian Aviation Regulations
“any defect, malfunction or failure of an aeronautical product, component,
equipment or part affecting, or that, if not corrected, is likely to affect, the safety

of the aircraft, its occupants or any other person.” Air operators are required to
report SDRs to Transport Canada. The system mirrors that in the United States.
Transport Canada provides clunky web-based access at
http://www.tc.gc.ca/wsdrs/ Specific search parameters have to be entered.
The easiest way to get the SDR data in bulk is to go to the FAA’s SDR website,
at http://av-info.faa.gov/dd_sublevel.asp?Folder=%5CSDRS, and download the
data there. Canadian SDRs are included pursuant to a cooperation agreement
between the FAA and Transport Canada. The usual caveats apply to SDR data
in that reporting is likely incomplete, and some SDRs indicate issues discovered
during routine maintenance. Therefore, you should be careful in interpreting SDR
data. SDR data is also available from IRE/NICAR.
TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD
The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is considered to be the official
source of transportation safety data in Canada. It maintains its own aviation
occurrences database that largely mirrors CADORs and records incidents in
other modes as well. If you contact TSB media relations at (819) 994-8053, staff
will provide chunks of the data reflecting specific time periods or incident types in
Excel and pdf format. You need both files to get the complete picture. Contact
me at Fvjones@dal.ca for more information.
The TSB provides summary statistics on air, rail, highway, marine and pipeline
incidents and at http://www.tsb.gc.ca/en/stats/index.asp?section=3.1
OPERATIONAL INFORATION
Transport Canada considers information on actual flight hours and flight legs to
be confidential, proprietary information of the airlines. It argues that it would allow
requesters to figure out carriers’ competitive strategies and capacity plans. The
fact that the same information is freely downloadable in the U.S. appears not to
matter. Information on flights to and from the United States can be obtained,
however, from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Look for the T-100
international market and international segment tables at

%20Statistics%20%28Form%2041%20Traffic%29%20All%20Carriers&DB_Short_Name=Air%20Carriers
Statistics Canada provides high-level air carrier statistics, including number of
passengers carried and kilometres travelled at

landings from larger Canadian airports at
