IRE Conference 2018

Starting out:
• Where is the pressure on the rental and real
estate market and what’s causing it?
• What neighborhoods are in transition or crisis?
• How is the housing safety net breaking down?
• Are the people who need it the most being
poorly served or taken advantage of?
• Is there public $ involved?

Seattle’s housing problem in 2 graphics
*In 2013, the # of people living on
the streets and in cars in the region
was 2,736. Today, it’s 6,320

*Recent study based on 2016

data study shows an affordable
housing gap of about 60K units

Rental Assistance
To address the problem, authorities are pouring millions into
rental assistance programs designed to prevent and limit
homelessness
• How to find them:
• State corrections department
• City, state and local human services departments (ex. Rapid Rehousing)
• Local Continuum of Care
• Veterans Administration (VASH rental voucher for homeless vets)

What we found
• Starting with a tip from a
source, we found records
showing clients of those
programs ended up in
dilapidated and unsafe
homes, some owned by a
landlord whose rental
properties have racked up
hundreds of health and safety
violations
• The Wash. gov’t agencies that
oversee them do not require
checks of code violation
records before clients move in

Challenges
Getting the goods:
• Public agencies vs.
private contractors
• Hundreds of housing
agencies and
landlords operating in
35 cities
• Following the $
• Cutting through LLC’s
to ID bad landlords

Key Documents
• To pinpoint where the money was flowing, an we obtained over 1,000 pages
of records:
1. Vendor rosters
2. Payment records (check registers, invoices, contracts)
3. Code violations (Seattle databases of previous cases, paper records
detailing inspections and tenant complaints)
4. Federal, state and city lawsuits
5. Construction permit applications
6. Seattle police incident reports
7. Seattle Fire Department inspection records
8. Eviction enforcement logs from law enforcement)
9. Land use records to get details on LLC’s (online databases)
10.Federal tax filings (990’s)

ID the landlord
After establishing that rental
assistance recipients had stayed
at his properties, we built a
profile of our landlord using
hundreds of records:
• Property tax payment
invoices
• Corporation registrations (He
operates at least 17 LLC’s)
• Federal bankruptcy petitions
• Civil lawsuits
• Seattle code violation records
• Emails from City of Seattle
employees

Neglect and Disrepair

• You may be forced to hand-build your
own databases. Spreadsheets help
organize diffuse data.

• Pivot tables will allow
you to draw conclusions
and save time.
• Search functions are
life.

Takeaways
• Find time to chase down tips
• Often the people who use rental assistance programs
have no other options and have lives complicated by
substance abuse, homelessness, mental illness and
trauma. Take care in using them as sources
• The people working on these complicated problems
often have good intentions. Hold them accountable
for failures, anyway.
