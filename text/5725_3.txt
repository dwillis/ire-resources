Obama: Congress should let
panel set Medicare payments

WASHINGTON - In the struggle over legislation to overhaul the health

system, President Barack Obama is asking Congress to do something
it has rarely done - voluntarily give up some of its power.
While trying to expand health care coverage but curtail costs, Obama
is urging lawmakers to largely turn over their hands-on role in setting
Medicare payment policy to a panel of experts.
Though overshadowed by arguments over the government option of
health insurance, an independent panel could help Obama wring out
of Medicare the hundreds of billions of dollars in waste and savings
that he says will pay for most of the $900-billion cost of the overhaul.
"It could be huge," said economist Len Nichols of the nonpartisan
New American Foundation, who supports the idea.
Yet many lawmakers on both sides of the aisle in Congress take a dim
view of ceding their power to set reimbursement rates for suppliers
and care providers.

The American Ambulance Association, for example, has
depended on many champions in Congress over the years.
When Republicans ruled Congress it turned to Sen. Trent
Lott (R-Miss.), said its lobbyist, Tristan North. Now
that Democrats are in charge, it relies on Sen. Charles
Schumer (D-N.Y.).
After a GAO report found Medicare fell about 6 percent
short in covering ambulance costs, and an upstate New
York ambulance owner complained, Schumer acted.
Last year he passed a bill raising ambulance reimbursements
by $170 million over two years and in May he proposed a
permanent 6 percent hike, worth $310 million in its first year
alone.
The ambulance trade group was grateful. As it did with Lott,
it named Schumer its legislator of the year, and earlier this
year its members gave $37,300 to his campaign fund.
