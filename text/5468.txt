ATFs research in the late 1990s revealed that about 1.2 percent of the then 80,000+ dealers in
the nation sold nearly 60 percent of the crime guns. Significant policy and enforcement
ramifications.

There were more than 140,000 FFLs in fiscal year 2014. This includes firearm licenses for
dealers, manufacturers, importers, and collectors. During that time, ATF conducted 10,429
firearms compliance inspections and sought revocation of firearms licenses on 74 occasions.

Data you should try to get:
Local gun recovery – data or paper
Location data can be helpful to show where MOST guns are being recovered.
Ask for your Shotspotter contract and associated data, which despite what your city may tell
you, *is* a matter of public record
Some states include gun sales info to the public
Look for gun trafficking cases in local and federal court
FOIA for Nspect/Nforce database
