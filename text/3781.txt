used to hide proceeds of corruption
• Excessive layering or complexity
• Use of offshore jurisdictions, especially multiple
jurisdictions
• Same addresses or nonexistent addresses
• Address is a post office box or is in same
building as real owner
• Directors are “professional nominees”
• Law firms used specialize in secretarial or front
companies
• Directors do not have the capacity to invest –
e.g. secretaries
