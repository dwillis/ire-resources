Tip Sheet for the Art of an Interview
Getting the interview
If there’s competition to get the interview find a different approach
Show what they gain by talking to you such as balance and a voice in the story
If they refuse, approach them with just a face-to-face meeting to explain the story
If they refuse try again in a couple days
Be genuine

Preparing
Write down questions and thoughts
Play the interview in your head, including the cadence of it
Research their background personally and professionally
Bring documents and interviews for reference

Conducting the interview or “The Dance”
Dress appropriately
Find a commo n bond: hobbies, kids the same age, etc.
Take the coffee that’s offered, you’ll become a guest rather than an intruder and
they feel like a host
Mentally prepare for the interview, adjusting to their mood. If they are
melancholy don’t be bubbly.
Silence can be your greatest strength – the person being interviewed will feel the
need to break the silence
Step out of your comfort zone
Take mental snapshots of your surroundings: colors, styles and collections
Develop a sense of when to ask the tough questions, when to push it and let up
Exit interview letting them know you may be calling to ask additional questions
or if they have questions to call you

Post interview
Write down any new or remaining questions to ask them or someone else
Review your notes and make any additional notes to yourself
If you recorded the interview, transcribe as soon as possible
Summarize the interview in a couple paragraphs, including highlights,
discrepancies and the overall thoughts or findings
