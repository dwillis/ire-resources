Why social media data?

Digital footprint of the average
office worker is 5GB. As we
conduct more and more parts of
our lives online this digital
footprint is only going to expand.
These trails can serve as primary
documents for our stories.

Why social media data?

Officials, government institutions
and other organizations may make
newsworthy statements on social
media

Why social media data?

Sometimes, a handful of
individual tweets can be at the
heart of a story.

Why social media data?

Other times, looking at social
media data in bulk can allow you
to understand larger issues.
In this example, a data scientist
did an analysis of the devices
used to tweet from
@realDonaldTrump to find our
which tweets were likely from
him and which from his
campaign.

Why social media data?

Given how prolific President
Donald Trump is on Twitter, it
may be worth asking what kind
of information and/or news did
he tweeted during his
presidential campaign.

Why social media data?

Some other stories take plae
online. For instance, what does it
feel like to be trolled? Social data
can help recreate the moment
trolling starts and potentially
convey an individual’s
experience.

What kind of data is
out there?

Let’s break down a tweet.

Laugh a little.
Then tell me what kind of data
this tweet may yield.

How do I get it?

How do you get the data? APIs
or Application Program
Interface*
*fancy word for a stream of data in
a format that robots/computers
can understand
http://bit.ly/nicar2017-social-data

How do I get it?

You write a script that accesses this
data stream and collects the
information you want and puts it into
a spreadsheet (.csv file).
Often, for popular APIs, there will be
a wrapper that exists in the language
of your choice.

Hooray, we already did that for you!

Things to look out for
Authentication: Different for each
company (Instagram requires app,
Twitter and Facebook don’t).
Rate limits: How often you can grab
data from an API per minute.
Scope: The kind of access you’re
getting to the data. You should read
up on their documentation. For
example, Twitter’s historical
searches go back 7 days, Facebook
mostly allows you to get your own
data and data from public groups.

Your turn!

Authentication!
https://apps.twitter.com/

http://bit.ly/nicar2017-social-data

Your turn!

Authentication!

http://bit.ly/nicar2017-social-data

Your turn!

1.) Open up your Terminal and go to the folder where you want to clone this
repository of code using the cd bash command.
git clone https://github.com/lamthuyvo/social-media-data-scripts.git
cd social-data-scripts

2.) Then install all the dependencies, i.e. the Python libraries we are using for these
scripts by running the following command:

Setting up
https://github.com/lamthuyvo/so
cial-media-data-scripts

pip install -r requirements.txt

3.) Make a secrets.py file that is modeled after the secrets.py.example file by going
into the scripts directory and running these bash commands
cd scripts
cp secrets.py.example secrets.py

Now you have a secrets.py file! Open it up in a text editor of your choice (like
Atom or Sublime Text!) and fill the credentials you created earlier. Don't forget to
save it!

Any caveats?

Get some context as to who uses
what.

http://bit.ly/nicar2017-social-data

Any caveats?

Be wary of the tyranny of
the loudest!

http://bit.ly/nicar2017-social-data

Any caveats?

Of all the people who
watched this live stream
only 3% actually
commented.

http://bit.ly/nicar2017-social-data

Any caveats?

People may not be who they
say they are…!

Is it a burger or is it a cat?
