Companies attach copies of material agreements like employment contacts to their SEC
filings. Some of these contracts include home addresses or other obscure information for
the signers. The Rocky Mountain News used an executive's home address in an SEC
filing to connect the dots with a campaign-finance database to confirm that a donor was
affiliated with the recipient of a controversial government contract.
In this era of increased disclosure of joint ventures and other subsidiaries and
investments, chances are better that financial information about a governmental project
might creep into an SEC filing. For example, certain federal contracts might be given to a
private company that is mum, but one of its owners may be a "reporting company" with
the SEC - and disclose financial information or risks from the project in their own filing.
Disclosure of stock ownership and sales by executives is difficult to read and understand
-- it takes practice. Don't expect an easy and fast answer to a simple question like, "How
much money will this executive make from the merger?" Read footnotes carefully and
note that the dates and time periods in an annual proxy statement vary, making your math
all the more challenging.
A company's fullest disclosure comes when it registers stock or debt for sale, typically in
an S-1, S-3 or S-4 filing. Because the forms are designed to educate and warn investors,
they include a lengthy set of "risk factors" including lawsuits and investigations. But read
several companies' risk factors to learn what's typical. Corporate lawyers are telling
clients to go overboard with warnings, so many companies include language about how
they might run out of money - even if they're relatively healthy.
