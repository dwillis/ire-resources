ARIZONA PROJECT LEGACY – PROTECTING JOURNALISTS FROM NEW THREATS
INVESTIGATIVE REPORTERS & EDITORS CONFERENCE 2017
Description: Journalists face a myriad of threats as they pursue truth in dangerous places with
dangerous people. Protecting information and sources, and protecting one’s own skin - all are
complicated. The journalist must think like a spymaster, and we will examine cases from
journalism, from business espionage, and from the world of counterintelligence to identify
some best practices.
10 SECURITY TIPS FOR JOURNALISTS
This presentation is dedicated “to the reporter who is willing to stand when others will run,
who will press on with questions when others have been cowed into silence.”
