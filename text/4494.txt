Some of the resources I’ve used in reporting on special life support units in California
Nursing Homes:
A searchable database of the health status of nursing home residents.
http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Computer-Data-andSystems/Minimum-Data-Set-3-0-Public-Reports/Minimum-Data-Set-3-0-FrequencyReport.html
Finding this data set was like winning the lottery. Nursing home providers have to
answer a series of questions about their residents at regular time intervals no matter
who is paying for care. And they give all that data to CMS. The questions range from
whether a resident has dementia to whether they have a feeding tube.
2. Get the form - know what is being asked. In the case the CMS searchable
database, the data is based on a 40-page questionnaire - Minimum Data Set (MDS)
- Version 3.0
Resident Assessment and Care Screening Nursing Home Comprehensive Item Set

3. Health care facilities come with many regulations. For example, in a nursing
home, the minimum distance between beds is regulated by a state agency. In
California, they can be just three feet apart. It was a poignant detail when describing
daily life for the residents of the nursing home. Get the regs from the state agency
that oversees nursing homes or hospitals for the specific area you are reporting on.
Those details can help tell the story.
4. It’s all about the money. Every medical procedure has a code, and every code
comes with a price tag. There is more than one way to track down the codes and
cost but below is one searchable database that allows you to look up code and cost
depending on the region.

5. Ask families to ask their provider for medical records. This is a great way to fact
check (often families get some of the details of their medical condition and
procedures confused) and provides good detail for story telling.
6. http://www.medpac.gov
MedPac - The Medical Payment Advisory Committee - this committee advises
Congress and has lots of data and analysis. I found their data book extremely useful
in reporting on skilled nursing facilities.
