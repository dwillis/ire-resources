 A blessed continent
- Africa is resource rich, blessed with natural

resources like diamond, gold, coffee, crude
oil etc.
- Its projected GDP by 2050 IS $29 trillion

Population
Africa’s1.2 billion people provides a
huge market that is courted by
producers around the world.

A continent of the wealthy
The 67th richest man in the world, Aliko
Dangote is Africa’s richest man. The 57
year old Nigerian who wants to buy Arsenal
football club is worth $15.6 billion

Kibera, Africa’s largest urban slum
where 1,300 people share a toilet

Right next door to Kiberia is Karan,
a posh neighbourhood for the rich
and affluent

Africa’s biggest challenges
1. Corruption
2. Terrorism/Insurgency – Boko Haram in Nigeria, El Shabab in
Somalia and Kenya
3. Misgovernance/Inept governments
4. Development issues lack of infrastructure – schools, healthcare
facilities, roads, pipe borne water, electricity, housing etc.

 The African media is generally free

 Exceptions are in Ethiopia, where several

journalists have been tried and jailed on
bogus charges, Somalia where there is
virtually no free Press, The Gambia where
journalists are routinely tortured and
murdered and where many reporters are
still missing
 Media as part of the problem – corruption in
the African media
 Capacity/training challenges

 About 70 per cent of the Nigeria media is

owned by corrupt politician, politically
exposed persons and their fronts and
associates
 Many media houses are owing salaries of up
to 12 months
 Journalists are expected to use their
work/beat to earn a living
 Bribing of journalists to influence a story is
rampant – brown envelope syndrome
 Capacity/training deficiency
