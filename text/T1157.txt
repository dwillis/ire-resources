Tips for speaking
Thanks for agreeing to speak at the IRE national conference in New York. The amount of
experience of each speaker varies, but we have found these tips (some from us, some
from Roy Peter Clark at the Poynter Institute) to be good reminders for new and veteran
panelists. Please don’t hesitate to call us if you have any questions.

1. Be prepared. Go over your material until you are comfortable with it. Know how long
it will take and adjust your presentation to fit the time you're allotted.
2. Call your co-panelists right away to plan who will cover what and in what order.
Check for overlapping topics in other panels as well.
3. Prepare a one- or two-page tipsheet. Our members appreciate having something to
take home. We also want to post it on our Web site.
4. Use teaching materials creatively and please have some visual presentations.
5. Keep your presentation straightforward and offer five to 10 useful tips.
6. Stay away from long war stories. If you talk about a story, make sure it is a good
short example of what you are trying to teach.
7. Work with your co-panelists to leave 15 minutes for questions. Stick to the agreedupon time limits.
8. When you’ve finished your panel, head for the hallway right away and hang around
to chat. Each chat is a workshop. And please do go to the hallway so the next panel
can get set up.
9. Make participants feel like they are members of your club.
10. Remember that your words are being recorded for the ages and that IRE conference
tapes are widely distributed. Avoid such things as casual profanity or slander or
anything else you wouldn’t want your family to hear.
