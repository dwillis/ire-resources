When
correlation is
causation

"Correlation is
not causation"
has become a
meaningless
disclaimer

"Correlation is not causation, but here is more
evidence rejecting the view that world
globalization means wider gaps between rich
and poor countries."

"Correlation is not causation but the plunge
began just as The SEC voted in favor of highspeed trading firms being registered with
FINRA."

"Correlation doesn't imply causation. But these
statistics suggest that at the very least
technology hasn't helped much in our war on
calories."

"Of course correlation is not causation, but these
studies, at the very least, suggest that high
scores on AP tests are an important predictor of
success in college."

...

But if correlation
is not causation,
then what is it?

random error

confounding

selection bias

measurement
error

judgment error

Random error

100 timeseries
4950 pairs
1:99 odds

99% chance of
finding at least
34 of these
correlations!

The scientific file

random error
The file drawer problem has led to scientific
breakthroughs such as
• Daryl Bem: extrasensory perception
• Amy Cuddy: power pose
• Travis Carter: the mind-altering effects of the
American flag

random error
• what is the margin of error?
• if there's a "significant effect", how big is it?
• is the study very small or very large?
• statistics be damned, is the conclusion at all
plausible?
• might there have been a fishing expedition?
• are the numbers cherry picked?

Randomization

confounding
• stained teeth cause lung cancer
• there's no risk in being a firefighter
• poor people are stupid

confounding
• are there alternative explanations?
• can you think of a common cause of treatment
and outcome?
• when comparing two groups of people
according to one criterion, are those groups
equal on all other counts?
• what about age, wealth, time?
• was the study observational or was it an
experiment with random assignment?

Selection bias

Berkson's bias

selection bias
• is the data a representative sample of the
population?
• what are the selection criteria for admission to
the population?
• are people with poor outcomes or good
outcomes consistently measured, or do they
become invisible?

Measurement

Regression to the mean
"On many occasions I have praised flight cadets
for clean execution of some aerobatic maneuver,
and in general when they try it again, they do
worse. On the other hand, I have often screamed
at cadets for bad execution, and in general they
do better the next time."

measurement error
• how was everything measured?
• was the data self-reported?
• when adjusting for a confounder, does the
way the confounder is measured capture the
full extent of the phenomenon?
• what is the proposed causal pathway; are
there alternatives?
• was the research limited to the best or worst
cases?

Judgment error

judgment error

Immigration and

judgment error

Story time!

judgment error
• what claims are being made?
• what was actually tested?
• does the conclusion logically follow, or is it
just one explanation among many?
• if we expect long term effects, would the data
be able to show those?

recap
• random error
• confounding
• selection bias
• measurement error
