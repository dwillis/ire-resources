 QGIS is a powerful, open-source GIS software that is free to use. It is useful for data exploration and creating data maps for publication. This guide is a set of instructions for a workshop on QGIS, held at the NICAR 2017 conference. It includes a worked example for using QGIS to map fatal road traffic accidents in Florida in 2015, using a shapefile of county boundaries and a CSV file of accident data. It covers the basics of adding and styling shapefiles and data, as well as joining data to a shapefile using a common ID. It also covers adding point data using Lat Long coordinates and styling the data using symbols and categorical variables.

Here are some key points and tips from the guide:

* A shapefile is a collection of files that includes the geometry drawing file (.shp), a database file with text-based information (.dbf), an index file (.shx), and a projection file (.prj).
* To add a shapefile to QGIS, click the button that looks like a V with dots on it and browse to the shapefile.
* To add data to QGIS, use the "Add delimited text layer" button and browse to the CSV file. Make sure the first row has column headers, and that the headers are short and use underscores instead of spaces.
* To join data to a shapefile, use a common ID field and double click on the shapefile layer in the Layers panel to open the Layer properties. Go to Joins and click the green plus to add a new join. Choose the data file and the join field (e.g. FIPS) and the target field (e.g. GEOID) and click OK.
* To style an area layer, open the Layer properties and choose the Style tab. Choose a graduated color ramp and set the number of classes.
* To style point data, open the Layer properties and choose the Style tab. Choose a categorized symbol or a single symbol and set the size by a field value.
* To change the color of a layer or a symbol, double click on the color in the Layers panel or in the Layer properties>Style menu.
* To add transparency to a layer, use the transparency slider in the Layer properties>Style menu.
* To identify features on a map, use the "Identify Features" button and click on a feature. The Identify results panel will open and show the information attached to the feature.
* To look at the attribute table of a shapefile, right click on the layer in the Layers panel and choose "Open Attribute Table".

In summary, QGIS is a powerful and free GIS software that is useful for data exploration and mapping. This guide covers the basics of adding and styling shapefiles and data, as well as joining data to a shapefile and styling the data using symbols and categorical variables. It provides a detailed, step-by-step example of how to use QGIS to map fatal road traffic accidents in Florida in 2015.
