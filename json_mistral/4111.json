 The First News App is a step-by-step guide to publishing a simple news application, with hands-on experience in writing Python, HTML, and JavaScript, and recording the development process in Git's version control system. The tutorial guides users through building an interactive data visualization from a structured dataset, resulting in a published work on the World Wide Web. The guide was prepared for training sessions of Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) and the National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting (NICAR) by Ben Welsh.

Users will create an interactive database and map about the more than 60 people who died during the riots that swept Los Angeles for five days in 1992, using data from a Los Angeles Times application. The code repository is available on GitHub, with a demonstration available at <http://ireapps.github.io/first-news-app/build/index.html>. Documentation is available at <http://first-news-app.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>, with issues tracked on GitHub.

To begin, users need to have a command-line interface, a text editor, Git version control software with a GitHub account, Python version 2.7, and pip and virtualenv environment managers for Python installed. The tutorial starts by creating a new development environment with virtualenv and initializing a Git repository. Users then connect their local repository to a new public repository named first-news-app on GitHub and push their commits up to GitHub.

Next, users install Flask, a Python "microframework," and configure it in app.py. Templates are stored in a separate directory, and a basic HTML file is created as index.html. A test server is run, and users can access the site at <http://localhost:8000> or <http://127.0.0.1:8000>. Users commit their work to their Git repository and push the changes up to GitHub.

The tutorial then explains how to access CSV data, use it in app.py, and pass it to the template, index.html. HTML is used to create a table that lists all the data, which is then expanded to include more information. Users commit their work and push the changes up to GitHub.

In the final steps, users create a unique "detail" page dedicated to each person, using Jinja, a templating language, to sculpt the data. Users commit their work and push the changes up to GitHub, resulting in a published news application.
