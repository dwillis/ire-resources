 This is an Excel functions and tricks handout for cleaning and analyzing data. The content is divided into several sections including date functions, dealing with time, string functions, other text functions, IF statements, SUMIF, COUNTIF, lookups, and miscellaneous. The handout also includes a Tableau Reshaper and a link to download matching practice data. Some of the functions and tricks discussed include YEAR, MONTH, DAY, WEEKDAY, DATEVALUE, DATEDIF, WEEKNUM, Pivot Tables, LEFT, MID, SEARCH, LEN, IF, SPLITTING NAMES, and creating a JSON object.

Date Functions:

* YEAR, MONTH, DAY: These functions extract the year, month, and day from a date field.
* WEEKDAY: This function returns the day of the week as a number (1 for Sunday, 2 for Monday, etc.).
* DATEVALUE: This function converts a date in text format to a valid date format.
* DATEDIF: This function calculates the difference between two dates in a specified unit (such as years, months, or days).
* WEEKNUM: This function returns the week number of a specific date.

Dealing with time:

* TIME: This function extracts the time from a date/time field.
* Converting time to seconds: This can be done by multiplying the TIME function by 86400 (the number of seconds in a day).
* Dealing with calls that run across midnight: This can be handled by checking if the "receive date" and "arrive date" are on the same day or not.

String Functions:

* LEFT: This function extracts a specified number of characters from the left side of a string.
* MID: This function extracts a specified number of characters from a string starting at a specified position.
* SEARCH: This function searches for a specified character or string within another string.

Other Text Functions:

* LEN: This function determines the length of a string.
* IF: This function performs a logical test and returns one value if the test is true and another value if the test is false.

IF statements:

* IF ELSE: This function performs an action if a certain condition is true and a different action if the condition is false.
* IF ELSEIF: This function performs different actions based on multiple conditions.

SUMIF, COUNTIF:

* SUMIF: This function calculates the sum of cells that meet a specified criteria.
* COUNTIF: This function counts the number of cells that meet a specified criteria.

Lookups:

* VLOOKUP: This function searches for a value in the leftmost column of a table and returns a value in the same row from a specified column.
* HLOOKUP: This function searches for a value in the top row of a table and returns a value in the same column from a specified row.
* INDEX MATCH: This function is an alternative to VLOOKUP, it first identifies the location of the data using INDEX and then returns the value using MATCH.

Miscellaneous:

* Tableau Reshaper: A tool used to reshape or pivot data before importing it into Tableau.

Tricks:

* SPLITTING NAMES: This trick separates first, middle, and last names into different columns.
* Creating a JSON object: This trick creates a JSON object with specified keys and values based on the contents of a text.

Additionally, the handout also encourages the readers to ensure replies promote fairness and positivity, avoid harmful, unethical, prejudiced, or negative content, and to use utmost care and respect while responding.
