 Welcome to the QGIS workshop tutorial based on the NICAR 2018 session by Christine Jeavans and John Walton from the BBC Data Journalism Team. This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a map of licensed tattoo parlors in Illinois overlaid on demographic data using QGIS, an open-source GIS software.

You can download the required data and shapefiles from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-cNLURVoUu7L66WyOoU06G-Ndc6xZOdH?usp=sharing).

This tutorial consists of the following steps:

1. **Opening QGIS**: Download the appropriate version of QGIS (2.14 Essen or later) from [here](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) for Windows or [here](http://download.osgeo.org/qgis/windows/) for older versions. For Mac, download older versions from [here](http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/archive).
2. **Finding your way around**: Learn about the main interface of QGIS, including the map canvas, layers panel, and toolbars.
3. **Adding a shapefile**: Learn how to add a shapefile to QGIS, which will serve as the base map for your data. In this tutorial, you will use Illinois county boundary files.
4. **Finding your way around the shapefile**: Understand how to navigate and customize the appearance of the shapefile.
5. **Adding data**: Add demographic data (CSV file) to QGIS and join it with the shapefile based on a common ID.
6. **Styling the area data**: Learn how to style the joined data using graduated colors to create a choropleth map.
7. **Adding point data**: Add point data (tattoo parlors) using Lat Long coordinates and style the points based on the registration status.
8. **Scaling the points**: Scale the points based on the number of (invented) customers.
9. **Labels**: Add labels to your county map for better readability.
10. **Saving as image and exporting**: Export the map as an image or PDF for publication.

By following this tutorial, you will be able to create a map like this:

Remember to save your project regularly to avoid losing any progress. Feel free to experiment with different styles, breaks, and colors to create a map that best suits your needs. Happy mapping!
