 This GitHub repository contains the NPR visuals team's opinionated project template for client-side applications, called "app-template." It is a collection of tools, scripts, and configurations that facilitate the development, building, and deployment of web applications. The template is under the MIT open-source license and aims to simplify the process of creating projects for NPR visuals.

The template assumes you are using OSX, Python 2.7, have virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper installed, and have NPR's AWS credentials stored as environment variables. It also provides various features such as rendering HTML from data, compiling LESS into CSS, deploying to S3, installing cron jobs, and copy-editing via Google Spreadsheets.

To create a new project based on this template, you need to follow these steps:

1. Clone the template into a new repository on Github.
2. Replace placeholders with your new project's name.
3. Create a new virtual environment and install the required packages from the `requirements.txt` file.
4. Run the `app_template_bootstrap` Fabric script to set up the new repository.

The template includes a `bootstrap_issues` Fabric script that can automatically set up your Github repository with default labels and tickets. After completing the setup, you can use the app-template to develop, build, and deploy your web application.
