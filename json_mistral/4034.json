 This repository, titled "Python mini boot camp at NICAR 2014 in Baltimore," contains the course materials for a Python training session held by Tom Meagher. The course is designed to teach journalists how to use Python for data analysis and cleaning. The repository includes a schedule, project files, and a guide for setting up Python on the trainees' personal machines.

The projects covered in the course include:

* Project #1: An introduction to Python types and variables, with a focus on working with CSV files.
* Project #2: An exploration of dictionaries, using a baseball player salary dataset.
* Project #3: An introduction to web scraping, with a focus on getting data from the web and writing it to a CSV file.
* Project #4: An exploration of APIs and JSON, and how to use them in Python.

The final goal of the course is to give trainees the tools and knowledge they need to start thinking about solving problems using Python. The course includes a guide for setting up Python, version control, and virtual environments on trainees' personal machines, as well as a list of helpful libraries and resources for further learning.

In addition, the repository also includes a sample JSON file with the following keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The JSON file is a summary of the text, with the id set to 4034. The authors are listed as a list of individual elements with the attributes: name, email, and affiliation. The description is a 1-2 sentence summary of the text, while the conference is listed as either IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed. The keywords are a list of no more than five terms excluding the conference and authors. The JSON file does not include any explanation or notes outside of the JSON object.
