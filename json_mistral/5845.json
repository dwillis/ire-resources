 Welcome to the IRE 2019 conference! I'm excited to share 30 investigative story ideas in various topics including schools, crime & police, transportation, workplace, and health & medical. I have ensured that the ideas promote fairness, positivity, and avoid harmful, unethical, or prejudiced content. Here's the first part of the list:

1. **Missing & Mis-reported School Bullying Data**
- Investigate the accuracy of bullying data reported by schools in your area, as Indiana law requires public and charter schools to report bullying incidents to the State.
- Look for trends in the data and involve concerned parents and local PTO groups in your reporting.

2. **School Rainy Day Funds**
- Analyze the financial records of school districts to determine if they have amassed large "rainy day" funds or budget surplus accounts while still raising property taxes.
- Focus on taxing authority, financial documents, and following the money to answer the question: Is anyone watching those who tax us?

3. **School Tornado Shelters**
- Investigate the availability and compliance of tornado shelters in schools in your area, especially in the Chicago region.
- Analyze the standards of the National Storm Shelter Association and the International Code Council for storm shelter certification.

4. **Violent Classrooms**
- Focus on elementary schools and request staff injuries caused by students for the last three to five years to gather hard data on verbal, physical, and violent outbursts in Oregon classrooms.
- The Oregon Education Association report can be used to show the significance of the problem.
