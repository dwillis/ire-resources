 The General Records Retention Schedule is a document created by the City of Fort Collins, Colorado, to provide legal authority for the destruction of obsolete city records, ensure records are retained for required legal and operational purposes, and identify departments responsible for the record copy of specific records. It covers various types of records, including financial, fleet and equipment, general administrative, governing body, historical, land use and planning, licenses and permits, litigation and legal counsel, personnel, and real property and infrastructure records. The retention schedule applies to all formats of records, and specifies the minimum retention period for the record copy and duplicate copies, if any. The schedule also includes guidelines for microfilming and imaging records, and handling non-records.

The document includes a master table of contents, explanations on how to use the schedule, specific retention schedules for each type of record, and appendices with non-records, glossary, and update request form. The financial records section covers accounts payable, accounts receivable, audit reports, bank deposit records, bond issue records, budget records, fee and rate schedules, financial guarantees, fixed asset records, franchise records, government revenue programs, grant records, insurance records, loan records, purchasing records, reports - financial, tax licenses issued to the city, and worksheets - financial.

The retention schedule specifies the minimum retention period for each type of record, which can vary from one year to permanent retention. For example, accounts payable records should be retained for 6 years plus current, while budget records should be retained for 3 years plus current. The record copy custodian is also specified for each type of record, indicating which department is responsible for maintaining the record copy.

It is important to note that no record should be destroyed if it is pertinent to any anticipated, pending, or ongoing litigation, claim, or other legal proceedings. Additionally, records that have enduring historical or policy value should be retained permanently, even if they are beyond the minimum retention period. Any exceptions to the General Records Retention Schedule must be detailed in an approved departmental records retention schedule.
