 D3, R, and VR are data visualization tools or techniques. D3 stands for Data-Driven Documents and is a JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive visualizations. R is a programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. VR stands for Virtual Reality, which is computer-generated experiences that simulate reality. DVR, on the other hand, is a Digital Video Recorder, a device that records television shows for later playback.
