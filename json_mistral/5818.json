 Welcome to the exploration of web APIs using Postman! In this tutorial, you'll learn how to gather useful data for journalism purposes, specifically for comparing violent crime in Chicago in 2018 with other years. Here's a summary of the topics and steps we will cover:

1. **Introduction to APIs**: Understand what an API is, and how it allows standardized communication between different pieces of software.

2. **Downloading and Installing Postman**: Get Postman, a tool to make HTTP requests and view responses, which helps to interact with APIs easily.

3. **Exploring NPR's homepage**: Use Postman to request the HTML of NPR's homepage to understand how APIs work at a basic level.

4. **Understanding URL structure**: Deconstruct a real-world Twitter API URL to see how various components like the API endpoint, versioning, and parameters play a role in requests.

5. **Getting yearly crime data for Chicago**:

   - Find the Chicago crime data API on the Socrata platform.
   - Learn how to use different parameters like year, primary\_type, and ward to filter the data as needed.

6. **Aggregating data**: Perform groupings, such as getting the count of crimes per year, by using $group and $select parameters with the Socrata API.

7. **Exporting data to CSV**: Modify the request to get the data as a CSV file, making it more familiar and usable for those who prefer working with spreadsheets.

8. **Filtering violent crime**: Understand the definition of violent crime according to the FBI, and learn how to filter for only violent crime incidents in the Chicago crime data.

Throughout this tutorial, we will use the Postman tool to interact with various APIs, understand URL structures, and learn how to request specific data using query parameters. Stay tuned!
