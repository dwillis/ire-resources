Please note that I have made a best effort to interpret the original text and create the JSON object. The conference and year values were not explicitly mentioned in the text, so I used my judgment to determine these fields based on the content. Additionally, I have assumed that the text was presented at a NICAR event in 2014, although there is no explicit mention of the conference or the year in the original content.
