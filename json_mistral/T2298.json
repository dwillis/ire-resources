 The passage you provided discusses the Public Disclosure Act (PDA) in Washington State, which provides for broad rights of access to public records. The PDA applies to all state and local agencies, and the burden is on public agencies to demonstrate why a record should not be made available. The law does not apply to court records, and whether an entity is an “agency” is determined by a four-factor test. A public record includes any writing containing information relating to the conduct of government or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function. Requests for records can be made in person or by fax, phone, mail, or e-mail, and agencies are required to provide reasonable assistance to inquirers and respond to requests in a timely manner. If an agency denies a request, it must cite a specific legal exemption and explain how that exemption applies to the request. The requester may file a lawsuit in the Superior Court of the county where the record is located if the agency denies the request or unreasonably delays its response. There are 56 specific classes of public records that are exempt under RCW 42.17.310(1), and these exemptions are to be narrowly construed.
