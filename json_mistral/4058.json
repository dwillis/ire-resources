 The First News App is a step-by-step guide to publishing a simple news application, created for training sessions of Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) and the National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting (NICAR) by Ben Welsh. This tutorial teaches individuals how to build an interactive data visualization from a structured dataset using Python, HTML, and JavaScript while utilizing Git's version control system. The app demonstrates an interactive database and map about the more than 60 people who died during the riots in Los Angeles in 1992, repurposing data from a Los Angeles Times application.

Prerequisites for this tutorial include:

1. A command-line interface
2. A text editor
3. Git version control software and a GitHub account
4. Python version 2.7
5. pip and virtualenv environment managers for Python

The tutorial walks users through the creation of a Git repository, connecting it to GitHub, and setting up a new development environment with virtualenv. Users learn how to install Flask, a Python micro-framework, and create a basic web page that pulls data from a CSV file listing the people who died during the L.A. riots. The data is displayed in an HTML table using Jinja, a templating language. The tutorial also demonstrates how to create a detail page for each person and construct a JSON file containing information about the text.

The First News App documentation provides all necessary instructions, code repositories, demonstrations, documentation, and issue tracking, allowing users to learn and build the app in a clear and structured manner.
