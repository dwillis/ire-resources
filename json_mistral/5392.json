 Welcome to the First Python Notebook Documentation, Release 1.0! This step-by-step guide will teach you how to analyze data using Python and the Jupyter Notebook. By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to use Python and pandas to work with structured data for an investigation of money in politics using data from the California Civic Data Coalition.

This document is divided into chapters, each focusing on a specific aspect of the data analysis process. Here's a brief overview of the chapters:

1. **What you will learn**: Learn about the goals of this tutorial, what you will learn, and how it is structured.
2. **Who can take it**: Review the prerequisites and ensure you have the necessary tools installed and working on your computer, such as a command-line interface, Python, pip, virtualenv, a code compiler, Git, and the Jupyter Notebook.
3. **Hello virtualenv**: Learn how to use virtualenv to create an isolated corner of your computer for this project, ensuring no conflicts between different versions of Python libraries.
4. **Hello Jupyter**: Install the Jupyter Notebook and create your first notebook, a browser-based application for writing and running code.
5. **Hello pandas**: Learn how to use the pandas library to work with structured data in your Jupyter Notebook.

Let's get started!

Chapter 1. What you will learn
=============================

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to analyze data using Python and the Jupyter Notebook. The primary focus will be on using the pandas library to work with structured data for an investigation of money in politics using data from the California Civic Data Coalition.

Here's what you'll learn:

- Essential Python concepts, such as variables, functions, and data structures like lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
- How to use the pandas library to read, filter, join, group, aggregate, and rank structured data.
- How to record, remix, and republish your analysis using the Jupyter Notebook.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a solid foundation for data analysis using Python and pandas, allowing you to explore and analyze various datasets.
