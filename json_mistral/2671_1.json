 Sure, I can help you with that! Here are the steps to install Jupyter Notebook and Agate on your computer:

1. Download and install Anaconda on your computer from this link: <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>. Make sure to install the version for Python 3.5.
2. Open your terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows) and type `conda list`. If a big stream of text goes by, you've got Anaconda installed.
3. Update Anaconda by typing `conda update` in your terminal and say yes to the installation.
4. Create a new environment for Jupyter Notebook and Agate by typing `conda create --name homework python=3 jupyter` in your terminal and say yes to the installation.
5. Activate the new environment by typing `source activate homework` on a Mac/Linux or `homework activate` on Windows.
6. Install Agate by typing `pip install agate` in your terminal.
7. Check if Jupyter Notebook is installed correctly by typing `notebook` in your terminal. A browser pops up with stuff in it.
8. Open the notebook in the browser, create a new Python 3 notebook, and test if Agate is working by typing `import agate` in a cell and running it.
9. Create a JSON file with the following keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id should be 2671\_1. The authors is a list containing individual elements with the following attributes: name, email, and affiliation. The description should be a 1-2 sentence summary of the text in direct, simple language. The conference will be either IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed. If the year of the event is not clearly identified, the value of year is Not Listed. The keywords are a list of no more than five terms excluding the conference and authors.

Here is an example of what the JSON file could look like:
```json
{
    "id": 2671_1,
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": "John Doe",
            "email": "johndoe@example.com",
            "affiliation": "Example News Organization"
        }
    ],
    "conference": "IRE",
    "year": 2022,
    "title": "Example Conference Title",
    "description": "A summary of the conference.",
    "keywords": ["example", "keyword", "1", "keyword", "2"]
}
```
Make sure there is no other text outside the JSON file.

10. Deactivate the environment by typing `deactivate` on a Mac/Linux or `deactivate` on Windows.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
