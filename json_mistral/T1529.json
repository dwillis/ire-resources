Note: The text provided appears to be a table listing crime statistics for various cities in 1999. The data is presented in a disorganized manner, and no title or author is clearly identified. However, the source of the data appears to be the St. Louis Police Department, so that has been listed as the affiliation for the author. The description is a summary of the data provided in the table. The keywords were chosen based on the topics covered in the table, including crime rates, cities, vandalism, disorderly conduct, race, and adults/kids.
