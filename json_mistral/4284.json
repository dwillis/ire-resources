 TechRaking is a program focused on using technology to aid investigative journalism, coined by Chris Bosh. The program emphasizes automating repetitive tasks, scaling up to tasks that humans can't do, making processes repeatable and well-documented, and avoiding reinventing the wheel. One key aspect of TechRaking is the use of virtual machines and open-source software.

In this context, a virtual machine is a simulated computer that runs inside your actual computer. It allows you to run an operating system without removing your existing one. VirtualBox is a popular virtual machine software. Ubuntu is an open-source Linux operating system known for its ease of use and portability. Participants in TechRaking events receive a virtual machine with Ubuntu 14.04 pre-installed, along with various open-source software such as the GeoDjango stack, QGIS, a Python scientific computing toolkit, Atom and Sublime Text editors, Tor browser, and Ruby.

To use these powers, participants need to understand how to update and install software. Apt-get is a powerful command-line tool that works with Ubuntu's Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) to make installing and maintaining software easy.

For example, to install MySQL server, you can use the command `sudo apt-get install mysql-server`. To upgrade a package, use `sudo apt-get upgrade <package-name>`. To find the right package, use `apt-cache search <package-name>`.

Regarding Python software, pip is like apt-get but for Python. To install a pip package, simply use `pip install <package-name>`. You can also install multiple packages, specify versions, and force upgrades.

For instance, to install the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk), a great collection of natural language processing tools for Python, first check if it's already installed by using `python` and then `import nltk`. If it's not installed, exit the Python shell and use `pip install nltk`. Then, test the installation by importing nltk again in the Python shell.

Lastly, participants need to understand basic command-line navigation. Using `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, and other commands, they can navigate their file system and interact with their virtual machine effectively.
