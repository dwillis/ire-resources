 It seems like you've shared a collection of tips, strategies, and an example related to using the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to access public records and documents. Here's a summary of the information:

**Three Strategies for Crafting Public Records Requests:**

1. Narrow request: Ask for specific documents or information.
2. Ask for everything: Make a broad request and negotiate later.
3. Make regular requests: As part of beat coverage, ask for calendars, emails, audits, and inspection reports.

**Tips for Finding and Using Documents:**

1. Be aware that documents can be electronic and may contain errors.
2. Don't be discouraged by stonewalling; file FOIAs and request FOIA logs.
3. Get government retention schedules and request the same records from multiple departments and agencies.
4. Triangulate records by comparing them with each other and with other sources.

**Where to Find Documents:**

1. Federal, state, and local government websites
2. FOIA.gov
3. Courthouses, online dockets, and state sunshine laws
4. Archives, such as Archivegrid or the National Archives
5. Search Google by filetype .pdf

**Preparing for a FOIA Request:**

1. Determine what you're looking for and whether it exists elsewhere.
2. Exhaust other avenues, such as checking websites and agency e-reading rooms.
3. Do your homework by learning about the records and the law on which they're based.

**Example of a FOIA Request and Follow-up:**
The example shows a FOIA request for Melania Trump's travel documents and the subsequent correspondence between Dow Jones and the Air Force FOIA office. Dow Jones persisted in their request over several months, escalating the issue until the Air Force finally provided the requested documents.

Additional resources, FOIA generators, and guidance were provided in the original text, which I've excluded from this summary to save space.
