 This is a tip sheet for journalists on "Cultivating Whistleblowers" by Sharyl Attkisson, a CBS Evening News Investigative Correspondent. The tip sheet includes several tips and resources for journalists to consider when working with whistleblowers. Here are the tips and resources included in the tip sheet:

Tip #1: Consider the Power & Reach of the Net

* Post your email address and a paragraph asking for information from whistleblowers on your company's website and on websites of public interest groups related to your topic.
* Be specific in your paragraph about the type of information you are looking for and how sources can contact you.
* Search the web and Nexis under your topic and "whistleblower" or "lawsuits" to find articles, websites, and lawsuits with valuable public information.

Tip #2: Resources

* Contact Congressional investigators and attorneys who specialize in qui tam cases.
* The following groups may be willing to put you in touch with whistleblowers: Project on Government Oversight, Government Accountability Project, Whistleblowers Center in Washington, Taxpayers Against Fraud.

Tip #3: A Few Words on "Disgruntled Employees"

* Whistleblowers may be disgruntled for various reasons, but that doesn't mean their information is not credible.
* Check the whistleblower's credibility and information thoroughly.
* Address any potential "warts" or inconsistencies in the whistleblower's story.
* If the whistleblower is not willing to go on camera, consider using their information and quotes in your story without identifying them.

Tip #4: Dealing With Whistleblowers

* Have a "No Surprises" Policy: ask the whistleblower to come clean with anything someone could use to attack their credibility.
* Make him his own worst critic: ask the whistleblower to tell you the best arguments against their claims and who's likely to make them.
* Get the physical goods: get all the supporting documentary proof from the whistleblower.
* Avoid the Bamboozlement Factor: don't hesitate to address inconsistencies in the whistleblower's story and don't hesitate to abandon the story if the whistleblower is not credible.

Tip #5: Examples

* Six example scripts are included in the tip sheet showing varying uses of whistleblower types in different stories.

The tip sheet also includes a sample paragraph that journalists can use when soliciting information from whistleblowers. The paragraph includes an example of an investigative story on the Enron scandal and asks for current or former employees who might have information, documentation, and/or proof of misspending from employee benefits accounts. The paragraph also includes instructions for sources on how they can contact the journalist and assures them that their contact information will be kept confidential.
