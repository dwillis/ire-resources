 It seems like you're looking for information and tips on making public records requests for data, specifically in the context of health care and education data, and ensuring that the requests are made in accordance with applicable laws and regulations such as HIPAA and FERPA. Here are some key points to consider:

1. Before making a request, do your homework. Research the agency or organization you're requesting data from, as well as any relevant laws and regulations that may apply.
2. Be clear and specific in your request, and be prepared to explain why you're making the request and how the data will be used.
3. Be aware of any privacy restrictions that may apply, such as those related to HIPAA and FERPA, and be prepared to negotiate or redact sensitive information as necessary.
4. Be persistent, but also be respectful and professional in your communications with the agency or organization.
5. Consider consulting with a lawyer or legal expert if you encounter resistance or are unsure about how to proceed.
6. Make sure to keep track of all communication and follow-up as it may be needed for an appeal.
7. For health care data, be aware that HIPAA allows for de-identified data and limited or restricted use datasets.
8. For education data, FERPA protects the privacy of students and their education records, therefore, it is important to be aware of the restrictions and limitations when requesting such data.
9. When requesting data in a machine-readable format, be specific about the format you need, such as CSV, Excel, or SQL.
10. Always be prepared for the agency or organization to push back or deny your request, and be prepared to appeal the decision if necessary.

Here is an example of a request for health care data in JSON format:
```json
{
    "id": 5475,
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": "John Doe",
            "email": "john.doe@example.com",
            "affiliation": "Example News Organization"
        }
    ],
    "conference": "IRE",
    "year": "2023",
    "title": "Health Care Data Request",
    "description": "A request for information on hospital billing data from XYZ Hospital",
    "keywords": ["hospital billing", "health care", "data request"]
}
```
Please note that the above JSON is just an example and the details such as the name, email, affiliation, conference, year, title, description and keywords should be changed according to your specific request.
