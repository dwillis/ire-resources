 Welcome to this guide on finding and analyzing data on FEC.gov, created by Christopher Schnaars from USA TODAY. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) provides various types of campaign finance data, including individual reports, charts, maps, and datasets. This guide focuses on helping you navigate the FEC website and offering tips on avoiding potential pitfalls.

Committees are defined as entities required to file campaign finance reports with the FEC. These can include candidate committees, leadership PACs, joint fundraising committees, corporate/union PACs, and independent expenditure-only committees (Super PACs). It is important to note that entities not required to file reports with the FEC, such as 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) non-profits, will not have contributor data available on the FEC website.

The author highlights some issues with the Senate's filing process, as they still allow paper filings which can obscure donor identities and cause delays in data availability. However, individual Senate reports can be downloaded electronically once they have been keyed in, and PDF images of Senate reports can be viewed on the FEC website.

The guide suggests using third-party data from the Sunlight Foundation and the Center for Responsive Politics before delving into the FEC data. These organizations provide bulk FEC data files that are often available within 12 hours of a report being filed. If you choose to use this data, it is important to credit the respective organization in your work.

Weekly master files are another option for obtaining campaign finance data. The FEC provides weekly master files for contributions, committees, candidates, and candidate-committee linkages. These files are updated every Sunday and can be accessed at <http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/ftpdet.shtml>.

When deciding between using weekly master files or individual reports, consider the following advantages of weekly master files:

1. Fewer files to download and manage
2. Transaction Type codes offering more granular characterization of contributions or disbursements
3. Refunds included in the files
4. No need to check for amended reports
5. FEC vetting, including the addition of missing or incorrect candidate and committee IDs

Using individual filings rather than the master files has its advantages as well:

1. Timeliness, as you can download reports as soon as they're uploaded to the FEC website
2. Address information, including street address data found in individual filings
3. Names parsed into separate fields
4. Access to more forms and schedules not included in the master files
5. More contributions, as the weekly master files only include itemized contributions of $200 or more
6. More fields, as the individual filings contain more detailed information than the master files
7. Smaller file size if you only need specific reports or committees

To find a committee's reports, go to the FEC website (<http://www.fec.gov/>) and navigate to the Candidate & Committee Viewer. From there, you can enter an ID or partial name for a candidate or committee to find their reports.
