"description": "An investigation of a Superfund site in Garfield, NJ, where a chrome plating factory spilled toxic chromium into the ground in 1983, exposing hundreds of homes and businesses to the toxic chemical. The NJ Department of Environmental Protection allowed the company to suspend clean-up efforts with only 30% of the chromium recovered, leading to the site becoming a Superfund site in 2010. The EPA spent $5 million demolishing the plant and excavating toxic soil and approved a $37 million plan to build a treatment plant to decontaminate the water.",
