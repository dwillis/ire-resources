 This text appears to be a combination of a workshop syllabus and a set of instructions for working with the R programming language. The workshop is titled "Hands-on R class" and was presented at NICAR 2016 by Coulter Jones and Amelia McNamara. The syllabus includes information about the instructors, the code and slides for the workshop, and some tips and background information for using R. The instructions cover a variety of topics, including using RStudio, loading and manipulating data, creating plots, and using the dplyr and ggplot2 packages. The text also includes links to external resources such as cheatsheets and help documentation. Overall, it seems like this workshop would be a useful introduction to R for individuals who are new to the language and are interested in data analysis and visualization.
