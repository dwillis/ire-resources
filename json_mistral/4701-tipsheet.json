 This tipsheet is aimed at helping journalists who want to become "lonely coders" or data journalists, even if they don't have any experience in coding or have support from their peers. The tipsheet suggests starting with CensusReporter.org, a tool for exploring US Census and American Community Survey data by place or topic. It also recommends creating interactive tables, charts, and using Github for collaboration and version control.

CensusReporter.org is a powerful tool for finding data on specific places or topics. It has a simple place search, topic search, and guided topics to help users find the data they need. The data is presented in a table view, map view, or distribution view, and can be downloaded in various formats including CSV, Excel, GeoJSON, KML, or Shapefile.

Interactive tables can be created using Bootstrap CSS for styling, and DataTables library for adding sorting, pagination and filtering. Chartbuilder is an open source charting tool from Quartz that can be customized with a newsroom's fonts, colors and logo.

Github is a platform for hosting, sharing, and collaborating on code. It allows users to keep track of changes and versions of their code, and to work on projects with others. The tipsheet includes instructions on how to download and install Node, and how to set up Chartbuilder on Github.

Additionally, the tipsheet suggests, using browser developer tools and learning SQL to query databases. The tipsheet encourages journalists to learn at their own pace, experiment, and reach out to the Lonely Coders Club Slack group or the author for help.
