 This tipsheet provides a comprehensive guide on how to download and analyze campaign finance data from the Federal Election Commission (FEC) website. It covers researching all contributions made by a specific donor, finding reports for a specific PAC, and what to look for in those reports. Here are the key takeaways:

1. Why Should You Care? Campaign finance data is crucial in understanding the role of money in politics, as it can reveal who is funding campaigns and how much they are contributing. Most contributions come from an elite group of mega-donors who give millions of dollars to Super PACs, which can accept unlimited contributions but are not supposed to coordinate with campaigns.
2. Finding Contributions From a Specific Donor: To find contributions from a specific donor, go to the FEC website and click on "Campaign finance data" and then "Look up contributions from a specific donor." Type in the donor's name and you'll see a list of all the contributions they have made so far during the 2017-18 election cycle. You can click on the hyperlink under each contribution to see a summary of how much the PAC has raised and spent.
3. Downloading a Report From a Specific PAC: To download a report from a specific PAC, go to the FEC homepage and click on "Campaign finance data" and then "Filings and reports." Click on "All filings" or "PAC and party committee reports." Type in the name of the PAC and select the correct one from the dropdown menu. Click on any of the hyperlinks for the PAC in the first column to bring up a summary of their activities for the two-year election cycle. From there, you can click on the "Browse Receipts" or "Browse Disbursements" buttons to download data for Schedules A and B.
4. What to Look For: Once you have the data in Excel with clean headers, you can look for trends, such as how much money was raised, who the large donors were, whether the candidate is borrowing money to run the campaign, and how the campaign is spending its money.

Overall, this tipsheet provides a valuable resource for journalists and researchers looking to analyze campaign finance data. By following the steps outlined in the tipsheet, users can gain insights into the role of money in politics and how it affects election outcomes.
