 This appears to be a detailed agenda and set of instructions for a workshop on manipulating and extracting information from PDFs using various open-source tools. The tools covered include ImageMagick, Tesseract, Tabula, and PdfToText, as well as the commercial service Mechanical Turk. The workshop covers topics such as:

* Reviewing different types of PDFs and how to determine what kind they are
* A checklist for processing PDFs
* Manipulating PDFs and images using ImageMagick
* Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and using Tesseract to extract text from scanned PDFs
* Using Tabula to extract tables from PDFs
* Using Mechanical Turk to transcribe un-extractable data

It also includes a number of hands-on exercises for participants to follow along with on their own computers. The prerequisites for the workshop include having a Mac, Linux, or Windows system with the necessary tools installed, and a set of sample PDFs to work with.
