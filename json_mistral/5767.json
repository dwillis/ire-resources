 This is a notebook for a three-hour, hands-on class taught at the National Institute of Computer-Assisted Reporting conference in Newport Beach, California. The class teaches students how to use Observable, a web-based tool for coding and creating interactive graphics. The class covers creating an Observable account, creating and executing JavaScript and Markdown code cells, reactive programming, importing features from other notebooks, inspecting JSON data, creating reactive inputs with `viewof`, and manipulating d3 charts with reactive inputs. The instructors are professional journalists who use Observable to develop ideas for graphics in their work. The notebook includes examples and exercises to help students learn these concepts and create their own interactive graphic like one that appeared in The New York Times.
