 This is a tip sheet for a workshop on advanced searching techniques held at the NICAR Conference 2014 in Baltimore. The workshop, led by Acton H. Gorton of CU-CitizenAccess.org and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, covers a systematic approach to finding specific information using Google and Lexis-Nexis. The workshop includes an overview of key concepts and a walk-through of an audience volunteered search. The overview covers basics of word stemming, word truncation, word proximity, wildcards, controlled vocabularies, and free-text methodologies. The walk-through demonstrates Google’s “Fuzzy” search options and using Lexis-Nexis for newspaper and document retrieval.

The tip sheet includes a table of contents and covers the following topics:

* Format
* Basics
* Building Search Queries
* Google Advanced Techniques
* LexisNexis Techniques

The Basics section covers operators such as Boolean operations (AND, OR, NOT), word stemming, word truncation (aka “Wild Card”), word proximity, wildcards, controlled vocabularies, and free-text methodologies.

The Building Search Queries section includes step-by-step instructions for creating a search query using a conceptional framework, breaking the search question into concepts, identifying matching thesaurus words for each concept and combo term, stemming the search terms, and combining the concepts into a single search query.

The Google Advanced Techniques section covers various ways to refine a Google search such as using quotation marks for exact phrases, the pipe symbol (|) for OR, the minus sign (-) for NOT, the asterisk (*) for wildcards, AROUND(number of distance) for word proximity, the hyphen between terms for compound word search, site:nytimes.com for site-specific search, link:www.obpa.usda.gov/budsum/FY14budsum.pdf for linked pages, and verbatim searching.

The LexisNexis Techniques section covers Boolean operators, word truncation, word proximity, freetext fields, factual fields, and other searches such as capitalization and term frequency.

The Common Sections and Common Legal Document Sections cover various sections that can be searched on LexisNexis such as body, byline, city, company, date, geographic, headline, hlead, industry, language, lead, length, loaded-date, organization, person, product, publication, and section.

The Common News Sections and Common Legal Document Sections cover specific sections that can be searched on news articles and legal documents respectively.
