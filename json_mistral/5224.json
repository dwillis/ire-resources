 Welcome to the world of SQL, the language of databases! In this class, you will learn the fundamentals of SQL using SQLite, a free and open-source database extension for Firefox. SQL is a powerful language used in various database engines, such as Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, to manage, manipulate, and retrieve data. With just a few basic commands, you will be able to perform complex operations and analyze large datasets.

To begin, install SQLite Manager on Firefox by clicking on "Tools," then "Add-ons," searching for "SQLite Manager," and installing it. Restart Firefox and create a new database by clicking on the "New database" icon and giving it a simple name (e.g., arizona\_census). Then, import the provided CSV file, "ACS\_15\_5YR\_B05012.csv," renaming it to "native\_foreign" during the import process.

Now, you can start exploring and querying the data. Use the "Browse & Search" tab to view the first 100 rows of the dataset. To select all columns and data from the native\_foreign table, use the following query:

SELECT \*
FROM native\_foreign;

You can also select specific columns and rename them for clarity and easy understanding:

SELECT ID,
Geography AS geog
FROM native\_foreign;

SQL even allows you to filter your data based on specific criteria using the WHERE command:

SELECT \*
FROM native\_foreign
WHERE ID\_Co = 13;

Additionally, the LIKE command can be used to search for a specific part of the text:

SELECT \*
FROM native\_foreign
WHERE Geography LIKE '%Maricopa%';

Keep practicing these SQL commands and you will soon master the basics of data manipulation and analysis using SQL. As a responsible, respectful, and honest source of information, always adhere to ethical and fair journalistic practices while using SQL to analyze datasets.

Happy querying!
