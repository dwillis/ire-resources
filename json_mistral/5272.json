 Sure, I'd be happy to help you create a JSON file based on the provided text. Here is the requested JSON file:

```json
{
  "id": 5272,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "David Cuillier",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "University of Arizona School of Journalism"
    },
    {
      "name": "Jorge Rojas",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Arizona State University"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2017,
  "title": "Using This Guide",
  "description": 'A guide for journalists and citizens on how to sue for public records, including tips on filing the complaint, serving the agency, and haggling with government lawyers.',
  "keywords": ["FOIA", "public records", "litigation", "journalism", "government secrecy"]
}
```
This JSON file includes the keys and values as requested, including the id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The authors are listed with their names, emails (which are null in this case), and affiliations. The description is a 1-2 sentence summary of the text, and the keywords are relevant terms related to the content of the text.
