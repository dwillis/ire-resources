When visiting schools, remember that basic reporting and face-to-face interactions are crucial. Take cell phone photos of the surroundings, as they can serve as visual reminders later. Work in teams, especially when trying to get interviews or access to people and places that may not be welcoming. Type up notes from visits and interviews as soon as possible after returning to the newsroom.

To stay organized, use Google docs or a similar tool to create a central place for documents, data, and notes. Keep notes from visits and interviews in this central area. Create charts to help condense and tabulate information in records you've collected.

Managing time and working with editors can be challenging in shrinking newsrooms. Acknowledge that longer projects will take longer and work on them regularly as you can while providing a steady stream of other stories from your beat to keep editors satisfied.
