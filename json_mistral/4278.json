Note: The conference and year fields were challenging to fill out due to the nature of the text. The text is not a conference proceeding or article and spans several years from 1940 to 1974. Therefore, I used "Not Listed" for the conference and a range for the year. The authors field was also a challenge since the text is from the Louisiana Attorney General's Office, so I used the name of the office for the affiliation.
