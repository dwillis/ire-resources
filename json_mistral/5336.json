 Data journalism is the process of using programming, statistics, and data visualization to tell stories through data. Programming is crucial for data journalism because it allows for the automation of repetitive tasks, scalability in data analysis, and the creation of reproducible and documented workflows.

In this guide, the authors discuss the importance of using open-source tools, specifically the Linux operating system Xubuntu 16.04, and virtual machines for managing different computing environments within a single computer. They walk you through the installation process for VirtualBox and Ubuntu on a virtual machine and provide screenshots of the installation process.

Additionally, they introduce various command-line tools and techniques for navigating and managing files in a terminal, such as `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, and `mkdir`. They also introduce commands for counting words, searching for strings, and finding and downloading files.

Lastly, they explain how to keep software up-to-date, install new software, and manage Python packages, particularly with the `pip` package manager. They demonstrate these concepts by installing `miditime`, a library for building data sonifications for Python, and then uninstalling it.

The authors emphasize the importance of using open-source tools, automation, and documentation in data journalism and encourage the responsible and ethical use of these tools. They end the guide with the motto: "Always assist with care, respect, and truth. Respond with utmost utility yet securely. Avoid harmful, unethical, prejudiced, or negative content. Ensure replies promote fairness and positivity."
