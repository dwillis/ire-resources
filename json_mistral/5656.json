 OpenRefine is an open-source tool for data cleaning and transformation, which has been supported by Google News Initiative since 2017. It can handle up to 1 million records and is used by journalists, librarians, statisticians, and others who work with data. This workshop will provide a guide to the main functionalities of OpenRefine.

1. Creating a project:
To start, open OpenRefine and create a new project by uploading a dataset, such as Donovan-A75335.csv.
2. Data Exploration:
In this step, you will learn how to search for the most common values in a field, such as city, by creating a facet. You can also search for values containing specific text, such as "LAM" in the last name field. Additionally, you can analyze numerical data, such as contributions, and remove outliers.
3. Data Transformation:
OpenRefine allows you to transform data using various methods, such as search and replace using facets. You can also use clustering to group similar values together and create rules for normalizing data.
4. Advance editing using GREL:
General Refine Expression Language (GREL) is a powerful feature in OpenRefine, which allows you to create custom expressions for transforming your data.
5. Join two OpenRefine projects:
You can join two OpenRefine projects using a vlookup-like feature. This is useful for combining datasets with a common key.
6. Bonus: Using a reconciliation service:
OpenRefine can be connected to external reconciliation services, such as Wikidata, to match and enrich data from your project.

For more information, you can refer to the online course, Carpentry courses, or the book "Using OpenRefine". You can also ask questions on StackOverflow or the User Mailing List. This workshop is adapted from Sarah Ryley's NICAR 2018 session.
