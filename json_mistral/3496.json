 IRS Form 990 is an annual reporting return that tax-exempt organizations in the United States file with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). It is used by the IRS to ensure that these organizations are compliant with tax laws and regulations, and it provides transparency for the public into the financial activities and governance of these organizations. The form contains detailed information about the organization's finances, governance, and programs, including revenue and expenses, compensation of officers and directors, and details about any potential conflicts of interest.

Ronald Campbell, a journalist from The Orange County Register, explains the basics of IRS Form 990 and provides a guide on how to read and understand it. He points out that while the form can be poorly designed and incomplete, it is still a valuable resource for understanding the financial health and activities of a nonprofit organization. He also mentions that churches are not required to file a 990, and that nonprofits have to file 4-1/2 months after the close of the fiscal year, but many file for extensions.

Campbell also provides tips on what information to look for in the form, such as the organization's mission, sources of revenue, expenses, and financial performance. He also suggests looking for any "Yes" answers on certain pages, which would indicate that the organization must file an extra schedule. He also points out that Part VII, Section A and B, which lists the compensation of officers, directors, trustees, and the five best-paid employees, is a great source of information about the people who run the organization. He also mentions that Page 11, which is the balance sheet, is vital and it gives a snapshot of a charity's financial history.

In summary, IRS Form 990 is a valuable resource for understanding the financial activities and governance of tax-exempt organizations. It provides transparency for the public and is used by the IRS to ensure compliance with tax laws and regulations. Ron Campbell's guide is a great resource for understanding how to read and interpret the form.
