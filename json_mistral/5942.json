 Welcome to Investigative Research Techniques, where you will learn to develop critical thinking, adaptability, and advanced research skills using various tools and resources. This five-week course focuses on enhancing your ability to dig deeper into stories, uncover truths, and conduct investigative reporting.

The course meets on Mondays from 2:00 to 4:50 p.m. in Room 330, and attendance is mandatory. Bring your laptops to class, as you will be working on research assignments.

This course emphasizes original research, and you will prepare five graded memos based on the investigative work you conduct each week. These memos will include your findings and analysis, and will be graded on thoroughness, connections, sourcing, and detail.

Required readings for Week 1 revolve around watchdog journalism and identifying unanswered questions to shape your investigation. You will also learn to use the Zotero software and extension, a free research management tool.

The first assignment, due March 18th at 9:00 a.m., consists of picking a NYC agency to investigate and searching agency contracts, expenditures, audits, City Council committee reports and hearings, and policymakers' financial disclosures. Prepare a memo detailing your findings and the resources you used. A link to the detailed assignment instructions is provided in the class outline.

During Week 2, you will deconstruct the Miami Herald's reporting on Jeffrey Epstein and learn to use PACER and other court record sources to uncover information. Seamus Hughes, the PACER Whisperer, will share his tips and techniques for uncovering news in PACER.

The second assignment, due March 25th at 9:00 a.m., requires you to search SDNY via PACER and prepare a memo detailing your findings and resources used.

Throughout the course, you will build essential investigative skills across a variety of areas, from developing a critical mindset and document research to exploring court records, social media, and business resources. The curriculum has been designed to prepare you for the Investigative Reporting Class in the Fall.

In the spirit of the investigative journalist, always strive for care, respect, and truth, and promote fairness and positivity in your research and reporting.
