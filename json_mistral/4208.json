 Sure, I can help you with extracting data from PDFs and cleaning it up in Excel.

To extract data from scanned images, you can use a tool like CometDocs or DocumentCloud to apply Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to the images and make the text readable by a computer. Tabula only works with text-based PDFs, so it won't be able to extract data from scanned images.

To use CometDocs, go to their website and upload your PDF. You can convert the PDF to Word or Excel format, and the free version allows for up to five conversions per week. The premium version offers unlimited conversions and the ability to OCR a document and convert it all at once.

For text-based PDFs, you can use Tabula, which is a free, open-source software geared toward pulling data out of PDFs. It uses the location coordinates of the text on each page to extract data, and it is particularly useful for tabular data. Simply upload the PDF to Tabula and use the "rectangular mode" to select the data you want to extract. You can then download the data as a CSV file, which can be opened in Excel.

Once you have the data in Excel, you may need to clean it up to make it usable. This can involve removing blank rows, adding headers, and formatting the data correctly. Here are some tips for cleaning data in Excel:

1. Remove blank rows: If your data includes blank rows, you can remove them by highlighting the rows and pressing "delete."
2. Add headers: If your data doesn't include headers, you can add them by typing in the first row of each column.
3. Format numbers and dates: If your data includes numbers or dates, you may need to format them correctly to ensure that they are recognized as such in Excel. To format numbers, select the column, right-click, and choose "Format Cells." Then select the "Number" tab and choose the desired format. To format dates, select the column, right-click, and choose "Format Cells." Then select the "Date" tab and choose the desired format.
4. Remove extra columns: If your data includes extra columns that you don't need, you can remove them by highlighting the column and pressing "delete."
5. Clean up text: If your data includes text that needs to be cleaned up, you can use functions like "trim," "lower," and "proper" to format the text properly. For example, the "trim" function can be used to remove extra spaces at the beginning or end of a string, and the "lower" function can be used to convert all text to lowercase.

By following these steps, you can extract data from PDFs and clean it up in Excel to make it usable for analysis.
