 Welcome to this QGIS workshop tutorial from the NICAR session in 2017 by Christine Jeavans and John Walton. In this guide, you will learn how to use QGIS, a powerful and free GIS software, for data exploration and map creation, focusing on journalists' needs. Here is a quick rundown of what you will learn:

1. Download and install QGIS (version 2.14 Essen)
2. Basic navigation and user interface
3. Adding a shapefile (US county shapefiles)
4. Adding data through delimited text files (CSV format)
5. Joining area data (fatal road traffic accidents in Florida)
6. Styling the area data with graduated colors
7. Adding point data (individual crash locations)
8. Scaling point symbols based on data values
9. Categorizing data using different colors

**Section 1: Download and install QGIS**

Download the required version of QGIS (2.14 Essen) for your operating system from the following links:

* Windows: <http://download.osgeo.org/qgis/windows/>
* Mac: <http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/archive>

**Section 2: Basic navigation and user interface**

Launch QGIS and get familiar with the user interface. Key components include:

* Layers panel (contains map layers)
* Identify features button (inspects features' attributes)
* Zoom in, zoom out, full extent, and back/forward buttons
* Layer menu (for adding, removing, styling layers)

**Section 3: Adding a shapefile**

Download the example data from the workshop folder, which includes the US county shapefiles. To add a shapefile:

1. Go to Layer > Add Vector Layer
2. Browse to the workshop folder and select the sub-folder `U.S. county shapefiles`
3. Select the shapefile `tl_2015_us_county.shp`
4. Click Open and you should see a map with all the US counties

**Section 4: Adding data through delimited text files (CSV format)**

The provided dataset is a cut-down version of the not very cheery data set containing fatal road traffic accidents in Florida in 2015.

1. Go to Layer > Add Delimited Text Layer
2. Browse in `Fatals_fl_county_pop`
3. Check the box for 'First record has field names'
4. Choose 'No geometry'
5. Click OK

**Section 5: Joining area data**

Join the data to the map and display the results by county. This process is called a chloropleth.

1. Go to Layer > Data Source Manager
2. Highlight the shapefile in the Layers panel
3. Add the join layer `fatals_fl_county_pop`
4. Set the join fields: FIPS for the data and GEOID for the shapefile
5. Set the target field for the shapefile

When you use the Identify Features button, it shows the fatalities_sum from the CSV data in the Identify Results panel.

**Section 6: Styling the area data**

Show the fatality numbers using graduated colors and style the map accordingly.

1. Double click on the layer name to open the Layer Properties
2. Choose the Graduated style
3. Select fatalities\_fl\_county\_pop\_FATALS\_SUM as the column for aggregation
4. Set Number of classes as desired
5. Select a color ramp and apply

**Section 7: Adding point data**

The dataset contains individual crashes, so plot them using LatLong.

1. Go to Layer > Add Delimited Text Layer
2. Browse to `accident_florida` CSV file
3. Check 'X field is Longitude' & 'Y field is Latitude'
4. Select CRS WGS 84 (4326)
5. Click OK

You should see several differently-sized dots over Florida. These dots represent the relative loss of life in each crash.

**Section 8: Scaling point symbols based on data values**

Adjust the symbol size based on crash severity.

1. Double click on the layer name in the Layers panel
2. Choose Style > Size > Field type
3. Select FATALS as the column for adjusting the size
4. Adjust the transparency

Click apply and OK to see the adjustment in the map.

**Section 9: Categorizing data**

Look at the data using categories. For example, use the number of drunk drivers in the crash.

1. Double click on the layer name in the Layers panel
2. Choose Style > Categorized
3. Select the DRUNK\_DR column
4. Classify and uncheck or delete the "No Data" option
5. Edit colors based on crash severity or other factors

With these steps, you have created a powerful, engaging visualization using QGIS and shared it with readers. Keep exploring and learning more about QGIS to uncover other valuable features.
