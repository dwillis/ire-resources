 This guide, written by Christopher Schnaars from USA TODAY, provides detailed instructions on how to find and analyze data on the Federal Election Commission's (FEC) website. The guide covers various aspects, such as understanding different types of committees, the difference between using weekly master files and individual reports, and how to read a report summary. Here's a summary of the key points in the guide:

1. Introduction:
	* The FEC offers various formats of campaign finance data.
	* Be cautious, as it's easy to make mistakes while navigating the FEC website.
	* Christopher encourages readers to reach out to him or post messages on the NICAR listserv for help.
2. Notes about committees:
	* Committees are entities required to file campaign finance reports with the FEC.
	* Candidates for political office also receive ID numbers, prefixed with P, H, or S.
3. A note about the Senate:
	* Senate candidates often file reports on paper, making data less accessible and more difficult to work with.
4. Two ways of acquiring FEC data:
	* Using third-party data from trusted organizations like the Sunlight Foundation and the Center for Responsive Politics.
	* Directly downloading weekly master files from the FEC website, which contain summary data for contributions and expenditures.
5. Using the weekly master files vs. individual reports:
	* Advantages of using weekly master files include fewer files, transaction type codes, refunds included, no amended reports, and FEC vetting.
	* Advantages of using individual reports include timeliness, address information, names parsed, more forms and schedules, more contributions, more fields, and smaller file size for specific reports or committees.
6. How to find a committee's reports:
	* Go to the FEC website's Candidate & Committee Viewer.
	* Enter an ID or partial name for any candidate or committee to access reports and filings.
7. Additional files for summary numbers:
	* The FEC provides additional files for summary numbers, such as total contributions, cash on hand, and total disbursements.

This guide is based on a 2015 document, and users might find some information outdated, such as specific URLs or file formats. However, the guide still serves as a valuable resource for understanding the basics of finding and analyzing data on the FEC website.
