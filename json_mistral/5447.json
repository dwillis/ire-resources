 Chapter 3: Hello Template

In this chapter, we will create a template for our project using the Nunjucks templating language. Templates allow us to
separate the structure and design of our site from the actual content. This helps us to keep our code organized and
reusable.

First, let's create a new file called `base.nunjucks` in the `src/_layouts` directory. This file will serve as the base
template for our site and will contain all the common elements such as the header, footer, and navigation.

Here's an example of what our `base.nunjucks` file might look like:
```perl
<!doctype html>
<html class="no-js" lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>{% block title %}Default Title{% endblock %}</title>
  <meta name="description" content="{% block description %}{% endblock %}">
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
        <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>
  <main>
    {% block content %}
    {% endblock %}
  </main>
  <footer>
    <p>Copyright Â© 2023 My Site</p>
  </footer>
</body>
</html>
```
In this template, we have defined three blocks: `title`, `description`, and `content`. The `title` and `description`
blocks allow us to set the title and meta description of each page, while the `content` block is where we will insert the
unique content for each page.

Next, let's create a new file called `index.nunjucks` in the `src` directory. This file will be the homepage for our
site.

Here's an example of what our `index.nunjucks` file might look like:
```jinja
{% extends "_layouts/base.nunjucks" %}

{% block title %}Home{% endblock %}

{% block description %}Welcome to my site!{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
<h1>Welcome to My Site</h1>
<p>Thank you for visiting my site. Please take a look around and let me know if you have any questions.</p>
{% endblock %}
```
In this file, we have extended the `base.nunjucks` template and defined the `title`, `description`, and `content`
blocks. The `title` block contains the title of the page, the `description` block contains a brief description of the
page, and the `content` block contains the main content of the page.

By using templates, we can easily reuse common elements across our site and make changes to the structure and
design without affecting the content. This is especially useful when working with large sites or when collaborating
with a team.

In the next chapter, we will learn how to add data to our project using JSON.
