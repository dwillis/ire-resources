 This document appears to be a script for a workshop on data visualization using CartoDB, a tool for hosting and visualizing geospatial data. The workshop, led by Aurelia Moser, was held at the 2015 NICAR conference. The script covers the basics of using CartoDB, including setting up an account, importing data, geocoding, merging tables, and customizing the user interface. It also includes a case study on creating a choropleth map of traffic accidents in Georgia using traffic and census data. The script also covers building a map using VisJson and createVis in JavaScript.
