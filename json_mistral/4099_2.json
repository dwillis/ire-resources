 This GitHub repository, titled "Everyday Scripting," contains a tutorial for CAR (Computer Assisted Reporting) reporters interested in learning programming to work more efficiently and effectively. The tutorial, written by Agustin Armendariz, emphasizes the importance of delegating repetitive and time-intensive tasks to computers through scripting.

The repository includes a series of scripts and examples demonstrating various data manipulation techniques using Python and SQLite. Here are some notable scripts and files in the repository:

1. `db_audit_trail.py`: A script that demonstrates querying and updating a SQLite database.
2. `db_audit_trail_no_functions.py`: A simpler version of `db_audit_trail.py` without functions.
3. `grab_files_do_something.py`: An example of grabbing files with specific naming patterns and performing some action on them.
4. `parse_bls_lea.py`: A refined script that parses data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and LEA databases.
5. `db_audit_trail.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook version of `db_audit_trail.py`, providing a more interactive learning experience.
6. `requirements.txt`: A file containing required Python libraries.
7. `Linux Pocket Guide`: A reference to a Linux command line book recommended for beginners.

The tutorial mainly uses Ubuntu as the primary operating system, providing instructions on installing the necessary packages and tools for the examples and exercises. The author suggests using the terminal and commands from the Linux environment to perform various tasks and operations.

Overall, the Everyday Scripting repository serves as a helpful starting point for CAR reporters looking to expand their skills and automate their workflow with Python and SQLite.
