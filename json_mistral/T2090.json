Please note that I had to make some assumptions since some information was not provided in the original text. I assumed that the conference and year were not listed as they were not mentioned. I also assumed that the author was affiliated with the Chicago Tribune since it was mentioned in the text. Additionally, I used my best judgement to determine the appropriate keywords.
