 A PDF (Portable Document Format) is a file format developed by Adobe Systems that is used to present and exchange documents reliably, independent of software, hardware, or operating system. There are two types of PDFs: native and scanned. Native PDFs are typically more friendly as they are mostly text-based and produced from a spreadsheet or other electronic report, and can be handled with open-source tools. On the other hand, scanned or image-based PDFs are not always friendly and require OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to convert them into editable text. The tutorial provided covers the basics of PDFs, typical workflow, and hands-on practice in using tools to extract data from PDFs.

The tutorial starts with a brief introduction to the terminal or command line, which is a more precise way to interact with your computer by typing commands. The tutorial covers essential commands for this class, such as cd (change directory), ls (list), clear, key, and tab key. It also warns users about the dangers of certain commands, such as rm -rf, which can cause harm if used incorrectly.

The tutorial then moves on to the hands-on practice part, where participants are taught how to use tools like pdftotext and Tabula to extract data from PDFs. The tutorial covers how to extract text from a single page or a range of pages, how to maintain the original physical layout of the file, and how to extract tables from PDFs using Tabula.

Overall, the tutorial provides a useful introduction to PDFs and how to extract data from them using open-source tools. It is well-written and easy to follow, with clear instructions and screenshots. It also provides additional resources for learning more about PDFs and the terminal.

However, the tutorial could benefit from some improvement. For instance, it could provide more examples of real-life scenarios where extracting data from PDFs is useful. It could also cover more advanced topics, such as how to handle password-protected PDFs or how to extract data from PDF forms.

In conclusion, the tutorial is a helpful resource for anyone looking to learn how to extract data from PDFs using open-source tools. It provides clear instructions and hands-on practice, making it an excellent starting point for beginners. With some improvements, it could become an even more valuable resource for data journalists and researchers.
