 D3, R, and VR are data visualization tools, programming languages, and virtual reality technology, respectively. D3 stands for Data-Driven Documents and is a JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive visualizations. R is a programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. VR stands for Virtual Reality, which is a computer-generated simulated experience that can be similar to or completely different from the real world.

DVR, on the other hand, is a Digital Video Recorder, a device that records video in a digital format to a hard disk drive or other local or networked media.

These tools and technologies are often used in data journalism, which is a type of journalism that involves the use of data and statistical analysis to report on events and trends. The presentation linked in your message appears to be a guide for journalists on how to use various tools and technologies, including those I mentioned, for data journalism.

It's great that you are reaching out to learn more about these tools and technologies, as they can be incredibly powerful in helping to tell stories with data and convey complex information in a clear and engaging way. Let me know if you have any further questions about these tools or data journalism in general.

Regarding your question about Hash, PGP Key, and Signal, Hash is a way of encrypting text so that it can only be decrypted with the correct key. PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is a program that uses public key cryptography to provide cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication. It uses two keys, a public key that can be shared with anyone and a private key that is kept secret. Signal is a messaging app that uses end-to-end encryption to secure communications, making it difficult for anyone, including the app creators, to read the messages.
