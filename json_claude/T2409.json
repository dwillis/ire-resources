 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "T2409",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Jonathan D. Salant",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Bloomberg News"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": "CAR INVESTIGATIONS INTO POLITICS",
  "description": "The text provides six story ideas related to investigating political fundraising and spending, and lists websites with data on campaign finance.",
  "keywords": ["fundraising", "spending", "PACs", "lobbying", "campaign finance"]
}
```

I extracted the only author name and his affiliation. The conference and year were not clearly stated, so I put default values. The description summarizes the key points, and the keywords list some of the main topics covered without repeating information already captured.
