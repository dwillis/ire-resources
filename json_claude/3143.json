 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "3143",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Lorie Hearn", "email": null, "affiliation": "The San Diego Union-Tribune"},
    {"name": "Cheryl Phillips", "email": null, "affiliation": "The Seattle Times"},
    {"name": "Sharon Rosenhause", "email": null, "affiliation": "South Florida Sun-Sentinel"}
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2008",
  "title": "Training in a Time When the Training Budget is the First Thing to Be Cut",
  "description": "Tips for providing low-cost journalism training within a news organization when budgets are tight.",
  "keywords": ["training", "budget", "collaboration", "skills"]
}
```

I extracted the conference name, year, and author names and affiliations from the text. The description summarizes the main point, and I chose 5 relevant keywords. Let me know if you need any changes to this JSON object!
