 Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```json
{
  "id": "4925",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "IRE NYC Workshop 2017"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2017",
  "title": null,
  "description": "This text discusses techniques for doing quick investigations focused on potential harm, such as analyzing jail records.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigations", 
    "jail records",
    "data analysis"
  ]
}
```

I left the author name and title as null since those were not provided. The affiliation is based on the conference name in the input. The description is a 1-2 sentence summary, and the keywords list relevant terms from the content. Let me know if you need any changes to this JSON structure!
