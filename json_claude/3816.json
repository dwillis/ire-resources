 Unfortunately I do not have access to the original text you referenced, so I cannot provide a full JSON object. However, here is an example JSON object with made up data matching your specifications:

```json
{
  "id": "3816",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "John Smith", 
      "email": "jsmith@newsorg.com",
      "affiliation": "Local News Org"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2022",
  "title": "Data Journalism Techniques",
  "description": "The text discusses various data journalism techniques such as web scraping and data analysis.",
  "keywords": ["journalism", "data", "analysis", "scraping", "reporting"]
}
```

The id is 3816. The authors array contains a single element with name, email referencing a fictional news organization, and that news org as the affiliation. The conference is NICAR, and the year is 2022. The title and description are fictional. Finally, the keywords list contains 5 relevant terms.

Let me know if you have access to the actual text and need help generating the full JSON object!
