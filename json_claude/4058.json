 Unfortunately I do not have access to the original text you described, so I cannot generate the exact JSON object you requested. However, here is an example JSON object with made up data that matches the structure you specified:

```json
{
  "id": "4058",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Jane Smith",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Local Times"
    },
    {
       "name": null,
       "email": null,
       "affiliation": null 
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "2022",
  "title": "Data journalism trends",
  "description": "The text discusses current data journalism practices and predictions for the field.",
  "keywords": [
    "data journalism",
    "investigative reporting",
    "visualization" 
  ] 
}
```

The key things this example demonstrates:

- The id is a string set to "4058"
- authors contains a list of objects, each with name, email and affiliation keys
- Affiliation uses a made up news org since no real info provided
- conference is one of the allowed values you specified
- year contains an arbitrary future year since no year given
- description is 1-2 sentences summarizing imaginary content
- keywords contains less than 5 terms, excluding conference and authors

Please let me know if you have the actual text and need me to generate the JSON from that!
