 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "FreeDataTools",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "Computerworld"},
    {"name": "Cheryl Phillips", "email": null, "affiliation": "The Seattle Times"}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "2012",
  "title": "Free tools for data visualization & analysis",
  "description": "The text discusses free tools and resources for data analysis and visualization.",
  "keywords": ["data", "visualization", "analysis", "tools", "free"]
}
```

I included the two author names listed, used the conference and year given, created a short description sentence, and listed 5 relevant keywords. Let me know if you would like me to modify anything!
