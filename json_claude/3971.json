 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
   "id": "3971",
   "authors":[
      {"name":null, "email":null, "affiliation":"Davis Wright Tremaine LLP"},
      {"name":"Angela Galloway", "email":null, "affiliation":null}
   ],
   "conference":"IRE",
   "year":"2013",
   "title":"GOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY: Getting past \"No\" when government pushes back",
   "description":"Tips on negotiating with government agencies to get records requests fulfilled under FOIA and state open records laws.",
   "keywords":[
      "FOIA",
      "open records",
      "government",
      "transparency"
   ]
}
```

To summarize the key points:

- id is 3971
- authors includes Angela Galloway with no email or affiliation, and an unnamed author affiliated with Davis Wright Tremaine LLP
- conference is IRE
- year is 2013
- title and description are summaries of the main topic
- keywords list relevant terms except conference and authors

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON!
