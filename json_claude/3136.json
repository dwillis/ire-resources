 Here is the JSON object created from the input text:

  "description": "Tips for journalists on using social media sites and avoiding legal issues when using online content.",

}
```

I set the conference and year values to "Not Listed" since those details were not provided. The authors are the three people listed on the last slide. The description summarizes that it gives advice to journalists on using social media and avoiding legal problems. The keywords list some of the main topics covered.
