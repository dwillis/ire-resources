 Here is the JSON object created from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": 4983,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Electronic Frontier Foundation"
    },
    {
      "name": "Martin Shelton",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    },
    {
      "name": "Matthew Mitchell",
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": null
    },
    {
      "name": "Mike Tigas",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null  
    },
    {
      "name": "Sequoia McDowell", 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": "Introduction to Digital Security for Journalists",
  "description": "A handout providing tips and tools for journalists to improve their digital security.",
  "keywords": [
    "security",
    "privacy",
    "journalism",
    "encryption",
    "tips"
  ]
}
```

I parsed the text to identify the authors and any affiliations. Since no conference, year, or email addresses were listed, I put "Not Listed" or null values where appropriate. The description is a high-level 1-2 sentence summary, and the keywords list relevant terms related to digital security and journalism without including the conference or author names.
