 Here is the JSON object:

```json
{
   "id": 3950,
   "authors":[
      {"name":null, "email":"danielle.ivory@gmail.com", "affiliation":"Bloomberg News"},
      {"name":null, "email":null, "affiliation":null}
   ],
   "conference":"IRE",
   "year":2013,
   "title":"Tracking U.S. Government Contracts",
   "description":"How to find and understand data on U.S. federal government contracts and contracting processes.", 
   "keywords":[
      "contracts",
      "data",
      "FPDS",
      "FBO"
   ]
}
```

I set the conference to "IRE" since that acronym appears in the text. The year is listed as 2013 based on the date of the IRE conference. The description summarizes the main topic. And the keywords list some relevant terms related to government contracting data.
