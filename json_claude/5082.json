 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "5082",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null, 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Tages-Anzeiger"
    },
    {
       "name": "Barnaby Skinner",
       "email": null,
       "affiliation": "Tages-Anzeiger"
    },
    {
      "name": "Simone Rau",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Tages-Anzeiger"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "2017",
  "title": "Swiss Asylum Lottery",
  "description": "The presenters scraped and analyzed Swiss court verdicts to determine if judges' political affiliations affected asylum appeal rulings.",
  "keywords": [
    "Switzerland", 
    "asylum",
    "judges",
    "verdicts",
    "analysis"
  ]
}
```

I put the news organization Tages-Anzeiger as the affiliation for the authors since it was mentioned in the text. The conference was listed as NICAR. The year was listed as 2017. The title and main topic was the Swiss Asylum Lottery analysis. The description summarizes the main point. And the keywords try to capture some of the main topics, excluding the conference and author names.
