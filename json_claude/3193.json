 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "3193",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Phil Harbord",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Bosloe, CBC"
    },
    {
      "name": "David McKie",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "CBC Investigative Unit"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "NICAR - From Database to Story â€“ A Step-by-step Guide",
  "description": "The text describes using OSHA workplace safety inspection data to analyze trends and compare inspection rates across industries over time.",
  "keywords": [
    "OSHA", 
    "data analysis",
    "workplace safety",
    "inspections",
    "rates"
  ]
}
```

I left the author names as provided since no full names were listed. The affiliations come from the news organizations mentioned next to the partial names. The conference is NICAR based on the header. No year was provided so I put "Not Listed". The description summarizes the main premise, and the keywords list some of the main topics excluding the conference name and author details.
