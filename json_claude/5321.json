 Here is the JSON object created from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5321",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Mc Nelly Torres", "email": "Torres.McNelly@gmail.com", "affiliation": null},
    {"name": "Manny Garcia", "email": null, "affiliation": "USA TODAY NETWORK"}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text provides advice and resources for journalists to prepare to cover natural disasters.",
  "keywords": ["disasters", "preparedness", "sources", "databases"] 
}
```

I included the author names and email from the opening lines, used "USA TODAY NETWORK" as the affiliation for the one author that had an organization listed, summarized the key points into a description, and listed relevant topical keywords excluding the conference and authors. The other metadata fields were set to "Not Listed" since a specific conference, year, and title were not clearly identified.
