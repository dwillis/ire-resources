 Unfortunately I do not have access to the full text that was provided, so I cannot extract all of the requested information. Based on the prompt, here is an attempt at the JSON object with some missing information:

{
  "id": "5486",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": [] 
}

I've included the requested id, empty authors array, "Not Listed" for conference and year since no information was provided, and empty strings or arrays for title, description and keywords. Please let me know if any additional information can be provided to fill in more details.
