 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
  "id": "3354",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "VG"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": "Text mining of election speeches",
  "description": "The text describes a project to analyze speeches by political party leaders before an election using text mining techniques.",
  "keywords": [
    "text mining",
    "election speeches",
    "analysis",
    "politics",
    "Norway"
  ]
}
```

I left the author name and email null since none were provided. I used "VG" as the affiliation since that seems to be the news organization that published the content. The conference, year, and title were not clearly identified, so I put "Not Listed". The description is a 1-2 sentence summary, and the keywords list contains 5 relevant terms from the content.
