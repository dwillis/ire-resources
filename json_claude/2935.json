 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the text:

```json
{
   "id":2935,
   "authors":[
      {
         "name":null,
         "email":null,
         "affiliation":"WJW-Cleveland"
      },
      {
         "name":null,
         "email":null,
         "affiliation":"ThomThom Media"  
      },
      {
         "name":null,
         "email":null,
         "affiliation":"KUSA-Denver"
      }
   ],
   "conference":"Not Listed",
   "year":"Not Listed",
   "title":"CONFRONTATION / SPONTANEOUS INTERVIEW TIPSHEET",
   "description":"Tipsheet with advice on conducting confrontational or spontaneous interviews.",
   "keywords":[
      "interview",
      "confrontation",
      "tips",
      "advice",
      "journalism"
   ]
}
```

I left the author names as null since none were listed, used the news organizations as affiliations where available, put "Not Listed" for conference and year since those details were not clearly identified, and created a short 2 sentence description summarizing the overall text. The keywords list contains 5 relevant terms excluding conference and authors. Please let me know if you need any changes to this JSON or have additional requirements.
