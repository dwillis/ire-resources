 Here is the JSON object based on the instructions:

```json
{
  "id": "4700",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null, 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Verdens Gang"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Data journalism skills and tools in Norwegian newsrooms",
  "description": "A survey of data journalism skills and tools used in Norwegian newsrooms.",
  "keywords": [
    "Norway",
    "newsrooms",
    "survey",
    "skills",
    "tools"

```

To summarize:
