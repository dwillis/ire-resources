 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
  "id": "4218",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Lise Olsen", "email": null, "affiliation": "The Houston Chronicle"},
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "NMSU"}
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": "CONTACTS, STRATEGIES AND RESOURCES FOR BORDER AND IMMIGRATION COVERAGE",
  "description": "A comprehensive list of resources for covering border and immigration issues in the United States and Mexico.",
  "keywords": ["border", "immigration", "contacts", "strategies", "resources"]
}
```

I summarized the main topics covered in the text for the description, used "IRE" as the conference since it is mentioned, did not find a clear year, and selected some representative keywords. The authors list contains the one named author and an unnamed author affiliated with NMSU based on a link in the text. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON structure!
