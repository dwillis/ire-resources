 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
  "id": "2995",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Brigitte Alfter", "email": null, "affiliation": null},
    {"name": "Nils Mulvad", "email": null, "affiliation": "Kaas & Mulvad"}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Farmsubsidy.org",
  "description": "A project to obtain and publish detailed data on European Union farm subsidies and recipients.",
  "keywords": ["farming", "subsidies", "transparency", "EU", "data"]
}
```

I included the organization names as affiliations for the authors, summarized the key details in the description, and listed relevant terms for keywords. The conference and year were not clearly identified, so I put "Not Listed".
