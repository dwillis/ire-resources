 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4688_1",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Andy Lehren", "email": null, "affiliation": "The New York Times"}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "2016",
  "title": "Humanizing Data",
  "description": "Journalists should tell stories and humanize data to help information resonate with readers and viewers.",
  "keywords": ["stories", "visuals", "narratives", "context", "casting"]  
}
```

I extracted the author name and his affiliation from the text. The conference, year, and title were also directly available. For the description, I summarized the key point about humanizing data to tell impactful stories. And for keywords, I chose some terms related to the main themes around storytelling and making data relatable.
