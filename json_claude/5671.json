 Unfortunately there is not enough information provided in the text to create a complete JSON object with all the requested keys. The text does not include any author names, emails, or affiliations. It also does not specify a conference, year, or contain enough information to generate a 1-2 sentence description summary. 

Based on the instructions, here is an attempt at creating a partial JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "5671",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": [] 
}
```

Please provide more detailed source text with the necessary information to generate a complete JSON object per the specifications. I'd be happy to try again with more input details.
