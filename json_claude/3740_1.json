 Here is the JSON object created from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "3740_1",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Wendy Halloran", "email": null, "affiliation": "KPNX 12 News"},
    {"name": "Carl ToersBijns", "email": null, "affiliation": "Retired Arizona Department of Corrections Deputy Warden"}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "INVESTIGATING PRISON ABUSE",
  "description": "An outline for investigating allegations of abuse in prisons.",
  "keywords": ["facts", "evidence", "investigation", "prison", "abuse"]
}
```

I included the key details from the text like the authors' names and affiliations, set the conference and year fields to "Not Listed" since those details were not provided, generated a short description, and picked out a few relevant keywords. Let me know if you need any changes to this JSON structure!
