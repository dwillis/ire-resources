 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "4115_Part_2",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "2014",
  "title": null,
  "description": "Tips and strategies for investigating subjects online, such as using Twitter, LinkedIn, domain registration records, and social networks to find sources and connections.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigating",
    "online research",
    "social networks", 
    "sources",
    "connections"
  ]
}
```

I left the author name, email, affiliation, and title as null since those details were not provided. The conference is listed as NICAR, and the year as 2014 based on the first line. The description is a short summary, and keywords reflect some of the main topics covered without the conference name or authors.
