 Here is the JSON object created from the input:

{
  "id": "3350",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null, 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "",
  "description": "",
  "keywords": []
}

The input text did not contain any author names, emails, affiliations or other details to populate the JSON object. So I left those fields empty or set to "Not Listed" where appropriate. The title, description and keywords are also empty since there was no content provided to summarize. Please let me know if you would like me to attempt creating the JSON again from any additional input text.
