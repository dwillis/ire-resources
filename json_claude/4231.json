 Here is the JSON object generated from the input:

```json
{
   "id":"4231",
   "authors":[
      {
         "name":null,
         "email":null, 
         "affiliation":"Milwaukee Journal Sentinel"
      }
   ],
   "conference":"NICAR",
   "year":"Not Listed",
   "title":"Deadly Delays",
   "description":"An investigation found delays in newborn screening in Wisconsin led to deaths and permanent disabilities over the past decade.",
   "keywords":[
      "newborn",
      "screening",
      "delays",
      "deaths",
      "disabilities"
   ]
}
```

I left the author name as null since none was listed. The affiliation is the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel based on the website link provided. The conference is NICAR based on the context. No year was listed so I put "Not Listed". The description is a 1-2 sentence summary of the key points. And I included 5 keywords from the content excluding the conference name and authors.
