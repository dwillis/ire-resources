 Here is the JSON object created from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "IRE Better Watchdog Workshop | DC"
    },
    {
     "name": "Matt Stiles",
     "email": null,
     "affiliation": null  
    },
    {
     "name": "Karen Yourish",
     "email": null,
     "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Creative Uses of Campaign Data",
  "description": "Slideshow presentation on creative uses of campaign data in news reporting.",
  "keywords": ["campaigns", "data", "journalism", "elections", "politics"]
}
```

I extracted the conference name, author names, and author affiliations from the input text. The year was not clearly listed, so I put "Not Listed". The description summarizes the overall topic based on context clues. And I chose some relevant keywords related to campaigns, data, and journalism based on the content.
