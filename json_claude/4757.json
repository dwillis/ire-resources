 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4757",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Nils Mulvad",
      "email": "nils.mulvad@kaasogmulvad.dk",
      "affiliation": "Investigative Reporting Denmark"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Industry fight back and change the coverage of resistant bacteria in livestock",
  "description": "The agricultural industry is pushing authorities to accept antibiotic use and resistant bacteria in livestock, and fights efforts to make data on these issues public.",
  "keywords": [
    "agribusiness", 
    "antibiotics", 
    "MRSA", 
    "livestock",
    "Denmark"
  ]
}
```

I extracted the only clear author name, email, and affiliation. Since no conference or year is listed, I put "Not Listed" for those keys. The description summarizes the main point concisely, and the keywords list some of the main topics, places, and entities mentioned in the text.
