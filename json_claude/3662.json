 Here is the JSON object based on the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "3662",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Network Analysis For News",
  "description": "The text discusses using network analysis to visualize connections between people and organizations in news reporting.",
  "keywords": [
    "network analysis",
    "news",
    "reporting",
    "visualization",
    "connections"
  ]
}
```

I left the author name, email, and affiliation as null since no authors were listed. The conference and year were also listed as "Not Listed" since those details were not clearly provided. The description is a short 2 sentence summary, and the keywords list 5 relevant terms mentioned in the text.
