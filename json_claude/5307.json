 Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```json
{
  "id": "5307",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Washington Post"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2017",
  "title": "IRE Watchdog Workshop",
  "description": "A presentation showing techniques for investigating deaths caused by police Tasers and tracing the sources of guns used to kill police officers.",
  "keywords": ["police", "weapons", "data", "investigation", "Tasers"] 
}
```

I included "The Washington Post" as the affiliation since the presenter's Twitter handle is listed as being associated with The Washington Post. The conference is listed as "IRE" since that acronym appears in the title. The year is listed as "2017" based on the date shown. The description summarizes the main topics covered. And the keywords list some of the main topics without repeating the conference name or authors.
