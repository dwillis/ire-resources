 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": 4888,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Yael Grauer",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": "How to find hackers/security researchers and get them to talk to you",
  "description": "Tips for journalists on finding and building relationships with sources in the hacking and security research community.",
  "keywords": [
    "sources",
    "building relationships",
    "technical topics",
    "accuracy",
    "background interviews"
  ]
}
```

To summarize the key points:

- The id is set to 4888
- The single author Yael Grauer is listed with no email or affiliation
- The conference is listed as NICAR since the text mentions it
- No year is listed so it's set to "Not Listed"
- The title and description summarize the content
- Keywords list some main topics covered without the conference name or author info

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON!
