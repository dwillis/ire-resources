 Here is the JSON object created from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4225",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Mother Jones"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text provides data and links to resources related to mass shootings, gun deaths, and gun violence in the U.S.",
  "keywords": ["mass shootings", "gun deaths", "gun violence", "data", "resources"]
}
```

I set the title to null since no specific title was provided. The authors name and email/affiliation were also left null since no author name was listed, but I set the affiliation to Mother Jones since that seems to be the originating source. The conference and year were set to "Not Listed" since those details were not provided. The description summarizes the overall content, and keywords list 5 relevant terms.
