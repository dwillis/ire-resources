 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input:

```json
{
   "id": "4741",
   "authors": [
      {
         "name": null,
         "email": null, 
         "affiliation": null
      }
   ],
   "conference": "Not Listed",
   "year": "Not Listed",
   "title": null,
   "description": null,
   "keywords": []
}
```

I left most values as null since there was no text provided to summarize. Please let me know if you would like me to populate any of the fields based on additional information.
