 Here is the JSON object created from the input:

  "description": "A once-standout DEA agent has been accused of conspiring with a Mexican drug cartel to launder money and traffic firearms.",
  "keywords": ["DEA", "agent", "conspiracy", "cartel", "money laundering"] 
}
```

I included "The Associated Press" as the one author's affiliation since the text is from AP News. The description summarizes the key details, and keywords list relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. The conference, year were listed as "Not Listed" since those details did not seem apparent in the text. Everything is enclosed in quotations.
