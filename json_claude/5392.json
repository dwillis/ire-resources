 Here is the JSON object based on your instructions:

```json
{
  "id": 5392,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": []
}
```

I've left most values as null or empty arrays/lists since no sample text was provided. Once you provide the actual text, I can update the object with the appropriate values extracted from it. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional instructions!
