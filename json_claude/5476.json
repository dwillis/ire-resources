 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the text:

```json
{
  "id": "5476",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Annie Waldman", 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "ProPublica"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": "Tip Sheet: Iâ€™m Entitled to a Spreadsheet, Dang it! Going Deep on Health Care and Education Data",
  "description": "Tips for reporters on how to access restricted health care and education data sets through public records requests.",
  "keywords": [
    "health care",
    "education", 
    "data",
    "tips",
    "FOIA"
  ] 
}
```

I included the key details like the id, author name and affiliation, lack of conference and year listings, the title, a short description, and some relevant keywords. I left the email null since it was not provided. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON!
