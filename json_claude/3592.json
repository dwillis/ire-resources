 Here is the JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "3592",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "",
  "description": "The text does not contain enough information to summarize or extract keywords.",
  "keywords": []
}
```

I left most fields empty or with default values since the input text did not contain any useful information to populate the requested JSON structure. Please provide a text sample that includes details about authors, conferences, titles, etc. and I will try again to create the JSON object.
