 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4433",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Atlanta Journal-Constitution"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "2015",
  "title": "Tips for solo data journalists",
  "description": "A guide with tips and recommended tools for data journalists working alone in their newsrooms.",
  "keywords": [
    "data journalism",
    "tools",
    "advice",
    "solo",
    "workflow"
  ]
}
```

I set the conference to "NICAR" and the year to "2015" based on context clues in the text. The description is my own 1-2 sentence summary. The keywords are data-related terms pulled from the text. Let me know if you need me to modify anything!
