 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5621",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Ziva Branstetter",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Reveal"
    },
    {
      "name": "Adam Playford",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Tampa Bay Times"  
    },
    {
     "name": "Tyler Dukes",
     "email": null,
     "affiliation": "WRAL"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text provides tips for investigative journalists to avoid failures and mistakes in their reporting by being organized from the start, vetting sources, carefully analyzing data, fact checking details, reviewing design elements, monitoring social media responses, and transparency in corrections.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative reporting", 
    "fact checking",
    "data analysis",
    "social media",
    "corrections"
  ]
}
```

To summarize:

- Added the required keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords
- Set id to 5621
- authors contains name, email and affiliation for the 3 authors
- conference is set to NICAR since this seems like content geared towards that conference
- year is "Not Listed" since no year is given
- title is null since there is no clear title
- description summarizes the key points in 1-2 sentences 
- keywords lists 5 relevant terms besides conference and authors

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON!
