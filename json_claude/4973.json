 Here is the JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "4973",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Shawn McIntosh", "email": null, "affiliation": "Atlanta Journal-Constitution"}, 
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "A journalist describes investigating doctors who sexually abused patients over decades and evaded consequences.",
  "keywords": ["investigation", "sexual abuse", "doctors", "hospitals"] 
}
```

I included the one author name that was listed along with his affiliation. The conference, year, and title were not clearly identified, so I put "Not Listed" or null values. The description summarizes the key points, and the keywords capture some of the main topics.
