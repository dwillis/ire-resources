 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input:

{
  "id": "5064",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "58 things we learned while mapping all 25,000 of Californiaâ€™s election precincts",
  "description": "The author explains some interesting facts learned while mapping California election precinct data.",
  "keywords": ["California", "elections", "data", "maps", "precincts"]  
}
