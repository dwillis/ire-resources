 Unfortunately I do not have enough context to generate a full JSON object from the input text. To create an accurate JSON response, I would need more details such as:

- The full text content to extract entities from
- Examples of desired output showing the format you are looking for 
- Clarification on where to source information for each key (e.g. conference name, author details, etc.)

Without access to the source text or a sample output, I can provide a template of the JSON structure you requested:

```
{
  "id": "5126",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null  
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": [
    null
  ]
}
```

Please provide the full input text and any other relevant details, and I'm happy to generate the populated JSON object. Providing examples of the expected output would also be very helpful. Let me know if you have any other questions!
