 Here is a suggested JSON object based on the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5819",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": null},
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "The Times"}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2019",
  "title": null,
  "description": "An introduction to using command line tools to work with CSV data.",
  "keywords": ["csv", "command line", "data"] 
}
```

I made the following assumptions:

- No author names were listed, so name is null
- The only affiliation mentioned is The Times
- No title was given, so title is null
- The description summarizes that this is an intro to using command line tools for CSV data
- Relevant keywords are csv, command line and data

Let me know if you would like me to modify anything!
