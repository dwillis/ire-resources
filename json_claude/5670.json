 Here is the JSON object based on the instructions:

```json
{
  "id": "5670",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": "",
  "description": "This text provides background on computer-assisted reporting and data journalism.",
  "keywords": [
    "computer-assisted reporting",
    "data journalism",
    "investigative reporting",
    "databases",
    "visualization"
  ]
}
```

I left the author name, email, and affiliation null since no authors were listed. The conference and year are "Not Listed" since those details were not provided. The description is a brief 1-2 sentence summary. And the keywords list relevant terms from the text.
