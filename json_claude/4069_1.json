 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4069_1",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2014",
  "title": "FOIA & Government Databases: Best Practices for Requesters",
  "description": "Tips for journalists and others on navigating Freedom of Information Act requests involving government databases.",
  "keywords": [
    "FOIA",
    "government",
    "databases",
    "best practices",
    "requesters"
  ]
}
```

I set the author name, email and affiliation to null since no author information was provided. The conference is "NICAR" based on the text. The year 2014 comes from the date at the top. The title and keywords were taken directly from the input. The description is a 1-2 sentence summary. Please let me know if you need any changes to this JSON or if I missed anything!
