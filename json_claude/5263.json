 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
  "id": "5263",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "IRE"}
  ],
  "conference": "IRE", 
  "year": "2017",
  "title": "Explosions, Leaks and Toxic Clouds",
  "description": "The Toxics Release Inventory tracks environmental damage from chemicals released by facilities.",
  "keywords": ["chemicals", "facilities", "environment", "damage", "toxic"]
}
```

I extracted the conference "IRE" and year "2017" from the first line. Since no author name was provided, I put null for name and the conference name as the affiliation. For the description, I summarized the key points about the Toxics Release Inventory. The keywords list contains relevant terms from the text.
