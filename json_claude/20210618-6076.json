 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "6076",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Associated Press"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "BACKGROUNDING LIKE A BOSS",
  "description": "A journalist shares tips on how to efficiently vet the background of sources and subjects within 15 minutes.",
  "keywords": [
    "backgrounding",
    "sources",
    "vetting",
    "journalism",
    "reporting"
  ]
}
```

I included the Associated Press in the authors affiliation since the presenter mentioned contributing with someone from AP. Let me know if you need any changes to this JSON or have additional questions!
