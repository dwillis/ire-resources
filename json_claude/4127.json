 Unfortunately the text you provided does not contain enough information for me to extract all the requested keys and values for the JSON object. Based on the details available, here is an attempt at a partial JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "4127",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": []
}
```

The key information missing that prevented me from populating some of the values was:

- Author names
- Title of the content
- Date/year information 
- Description summary
- Keywords

Please provide the full text or clarify the information source you would like me to extract the JSON data structure from. I'd be happy to try again with more complete input.
