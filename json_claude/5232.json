 Here is the JSON object:

```json

  "id": "5232",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Eric Eyre",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Charleston Gazette-Mail"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2017",
  "title": "8 documents for investigating prescription painkillers",
  "description": "List of 8 types of documents that can be used to investigate prescription painkiller abuse.",
  "keywords": [
    "lawsuits",
    "reports",
    "statistics", 
    "disciplinary", 
    "warrants"
  ]
}
```

I included the author name and affiliation since the Charleston Gazette-Mail was mentioned. The conference is IRE based on the text. The year 2017 is listed. The description summarizes the key info from the text. And the keywords list 5 main terms related to the documents listed, excluding the conference and author info.
