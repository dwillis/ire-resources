 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
  "id": "5879",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Mike Soraghan", "email": null, "affiliation": "E&E News"},
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "Energywire"}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "PHMSA - interstate pipelines exploded or ignited",
  "description": "The article discusses incidents related to interstate pipelines, including number of explosions, fines and regulation.",
  "keywords": ["pipelines", "incidents", "PHMSA", "fines", "regulation"]  
}
```

I included the author Mike Soraghan and the affiliation E&E News since those were mentioned. The conference, year, and other authors were not clearly identified, so I put "Not Listed" for those. The description is a 1-2 sentence summary, and keywords list some main topics excluding the conference and authors. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON!
