 Here is the JSON object created from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "4105",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "inewsource"}, 
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "NBC"},
    {"name": "John Walton", "email": null, "affiliation": "BBC"}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Cross-platform collaboration for data projects",
  "description": "The panel discusses strategies for collaborating across media platforms to tell data stories.",
  "keywords": ["collaboration", "data", "journalism", "radio", "television"]
}
```

I parsed the text to identify the authors and their affiliations. Since no specific names were listed other than "John Walton", I left those name values as null. The conference was not explicitly stated, so I put "Not Listed". Similarly, a year was not given so I used "Not Listed" there as well. The description summarizes the key point about cross-platform collaboration on data stories, and the keywords list salient terms excluding the conference and author affiliations.
