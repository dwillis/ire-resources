 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "2841",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "Missouri School of Journalism"},
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "NICAR"}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Mapping Data for News Stories & Graphics",
  "description": "Mapping data extends computer-assisted reporting, uncovers new knowledge, helps people understand information, and provides graphics for publication.",
  "keywords": ["GIS", "maps", "graphics", "visualization", "news"]
}
```

I left the author names as null since none were listed. The affiliation for the first author is the Missouri School of Journalism based on the text, and NICAR for the second author based on the conference name. The year was not clearly identified so I put "Not Listed". The description is a 2 sentence summary of the key points. And the keywords list relevant terms for the content.
