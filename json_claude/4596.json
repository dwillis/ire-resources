 Here is the JSON object created from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4596",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null, 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "The Numbers Game",
  "description": "The text discusses finding stories in data and provides examples of data journalism projects.",
  "keywords": [
    "data",
    "journalism",
    "investigation",
    "stories",
    "analysis"
  ]
}
```

I left the author name, email, and affiliation as null since no authors were listed. The conference and year were set to "Not Listed" since those details were not provided. The description summarizes the main topic of data journalism and finding stories in data. The keywords extract some of the key themes like data, analysis, investigation, etc.
