 Here is the JSON object created from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "4662",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "FiveThirtyEight"
    },
    {
      "name": null, 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "FiveThirtyEight"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Working with big geodata (without messing up)",
  "description": "The authors describe mistakes made and lessons learned when analyzing large geospatial datasets about Uber and taxi rides in New York City.",
  "keywords": ["geodata", "taxis", "Uber", "New York City"] 
}
```

I included "FiveThirtyEight" as the affiliation for both authors since that seems to be the organization they are affiliated with based on the context. The description summarizes the key points made in the text, and the keywords list some of the main topics covered. The conference and year are "Not Listed" since those details are not provided.
