 Unfortunately there is not enough context in the prompt to generate a full JSON object with all the requested keys. The text provided does not include clear information about the conference, year, title, etc. 

To demonstrate understanding, here is an example JSON with some of the requested keys filled in based on the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "id": "5019",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "NBC"
    },
    {
     "name": null,
     "email": null,
     "affiliation": "Reveal from The Ctr for Investigative Reporting"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": []
}
```

I avoided making up any data that was not clearly contained in the prompt. Let me know if you would like me to attempt generating a more complete JSON object for a different input text.
