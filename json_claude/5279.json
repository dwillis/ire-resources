 Unfortunately there is not enough information in the text you provided to create the detailed JSON object you described. The text seems to be an agenda and talking points for a presentation, but does not include clear author names, a conference name and year, a title, description, or keywords to populate the object keys you specified. 

To create as much of the structure as possible from the information provided:

```json
{
  "id": "5279",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": []
}
```

I included the specified id and basic structure you asked for with null values where the information was not clearly provided in the text. Let me know if you have any other example text or a clarified set of information to create the JSON from. I'm happy to try again with more complete source data.
