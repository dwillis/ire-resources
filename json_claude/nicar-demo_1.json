 Here is the JSON object based on the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "demo_1",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Duke Reporters’ Lab"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Reporters' Lab Reviews",
  "description": "The Reporters' Lab aims to produce consistent, independent, fair and useful reviews for reporters.",
  "keywords": [
    "reviews",
    "tools",
    "reporting"
  ]
}
```

I made the following assumptions:
- No author name was listed, so I left name as null
- No email or affiliation was listed for the author, so I put those as null
- I used "Duke Reporters’ Lab" as the affiliation since that organization was mentioned
- I created a 1-2 sentence description summarizing the purpose of the reviews
- I included "reviews", "tools", and "reporting" as relevant keywords

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON!
