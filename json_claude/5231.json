 Unfortunately I do not have enough context to generate a full JSON object from the input text. As an AI assistant without access to additional information, I am unable to interpret the authors, conference details, year, description, or keywords to populate the JSON structure you requested. I'd be happy to try again if you provide the full text you would like me to parse into the JSON format. Please feel free to provide the input text and I will do my best to create the JSON object with the requested keys and attributes.
