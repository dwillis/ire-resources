 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the text:

{
    "id": "3457",
    "authors": [
        {"name": "Derek Willis", "email": null, "affiliation": "The New York Times"},
        {"name": "Anthony DeBarros", "email": null, "affiliation": "USA TODAY"}
    ],
    "conference": "IRE", 
    "year": "2011",
    "title": "APIs: Making the Web a Data Medium",
    "description": "A presentation explaining what APIs are and how news organizations are using them to make their data more accessible and portable.",
    "keywords": ["APIs", "data", "news organizations"]
}
