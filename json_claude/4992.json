 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the text:

```json
{
  "id": 4992,
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Sandra Peddie", "email": null, "affiliation": "Newsday"}, 
  ],
  "conference": "IRE", 
  "year": 2017,
  "title": null,
  "description": "Tip sheet provides links and advice for finding public records and background information online in New York state.",
  "keywords": ["public records", "databases", "documents", "journalism", "investigating"]
}
```

I included the key details like the id, conference, year, and a summary description. For authors, I just listed Sandra Peddie since she was the only named author. The keywords summarize some of the main topics covered. Let me know if you need any changes or have additional requirements for the JSON.
