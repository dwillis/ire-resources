 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "3286",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Andy Hall",
      "email": "ahall@wisconsinwatch.org",
      "affiliation": "Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism"
    },
    {
      "name": "David Kay Johnston",
      "email": "davidcay@mac.com",
      null
    },
    {
      "name": "Norberto Santana",
      "email": "nsmaximo81@gmail.com",
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2009",
  "title": "Back to basics: Finding stories in what is readily available but rarely examined",
  "description": "The text provides ideas for finding investigative stories using easily accessible public information and data.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative reporting", 
    "public records",
    "data analysis",
    "budgets",
    "schools"
  ]
}
```

I extracted the authors, conference name and year, created a short description, and listed a few relevant keywords. For authors without affiliations, I left that key null. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON structure!
