 Here is a JSON object created from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "6091",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "No text was provided so a description cannot be generated.",
  "keywords": []
}
```

I've left most values as null or empty lists since no text was provided to extract information from. The id is set to 6091 and conference/year are listed as "Not Listed" since that information was not provided. The description summarizes that no text was given. Please let me know if you have any other questions!
