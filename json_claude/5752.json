 Unfortunately I do not have enough context to generate the full JSON object you described. Since you did not provide any input text, I do not have the necessary information about authors, conference, year, title, description, or keywords. 

However, here is an example JSON object with some dummy data that matches the structure you outlined:

```json
{
  "id": "5752",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "John Smith",
      "email": "jsmith@newsorg.com",
      "affiliation": "News Organization"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "2022",
  "title": "My Presentation",
  "description": "This is a summary of the presentation.",
  "keywords": [
    "data",
    "journalism",
    "visualization"
  ]
}
```

Please provide the actual text you would like parsed into the JSON format, and I would be happy to try generating the full object. Without any input text, I can only provide an example of the expected structure. Let me know if you have any other questions!
