 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "3581",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Doug Haddix", "email": null, "affiliation": "Investigative Reporters and Editors"},
    {"name": "Mark Horvit", "email": null, "affiliation": "Investigative Reporters and Editors"}
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Financial documents expose insurance companies", 
  "description": "The series exposed insurance companies that continued selling policies despite having no way to pay claims and revealed owners siphoning profits while demanding rate hikes.",
  "keywords": ["insurance", "finance", "investigation", "companies", "policies"]
}
```

I included the key details from the text in the JSON structure you specified, using direct language for the description and limiting the keywords. Since no conference, year or emails were listed, I put standard values for those. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON.
