 Here is the JSON object for the document:

  "description": "A list of 101 types of documents that investigative reporters can request to uncover stories.",

I included Phil Williams as the only listed author, with his TV station affiliation. The conference name and year were taken directly. The description summarizes the document, and the keywords list five relevant terms related to the content.
