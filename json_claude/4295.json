 Here is the JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "4295",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null 
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "",
  "description": "",
  "keywords": [] 
}
```

I left most values empty since no text was provided to extract information from. Please provide the full text you would like analyzed and I will update the JSON object accordingly.
