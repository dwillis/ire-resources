 Unfortunately there is not enough context in the input you provided for me to generate a meaningful JSON object. To create the JSON object you described, I would need some additional sample input text that includes details like author names, affiliations, conference names, years, titles, descriptions, and keywords. Without that, I don't have the necessary information to populate the keys and values you specified. Please provide a sample input text with those details, and I'd be happy to try generating the JSON object again based on that text. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
