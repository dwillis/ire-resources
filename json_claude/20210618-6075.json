 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
  "id": "6075",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Center for Public Integrity"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": "Using data and votersâ€™ voices to show who would be affected by changes in voter access: Tipsheet",
  "description": "Tipsheet providing guidance on finding and analyzing data related to voter access and turnout.",
  "keywords": [
    "voter access",
    "voter turnout",
    "election data",
    "polling places",
    "mail ballots"
  ]
}
```

I extracted the conference name, created a summary description, and identified relevant keywords from the text. The author name and details were not clearly listed, so I left those null and used the one organization mentioned as the affiliation.
