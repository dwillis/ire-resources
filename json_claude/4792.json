 Here is the JSON object generated from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4792",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Marina Trahan Martinez",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Dallas Morning News"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "Tips and advice for a journalist to stay organized and effective in their work.",
  "keywords": [
    "organization",
    "productivity", 
    "journalism",
    "workflow"
  ]
}
```

I extracted the one clear author name and affiliation. Since no conference, year or title were listed, I put "Not Listed" for the conference and year keys. The description summarizes the overall content, and the keywords capture some of the main topics.
