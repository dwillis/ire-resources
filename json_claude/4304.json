 Unfortunately there is not enough context in the prompt to create a sufficiently detailed JSON object. There is no sample text provided to extract information from. The instructions mention keys like "id", "authors", "conference", "year", etc. but without any text to analyze I cannot populate those fields. Please provide a relevant text sample and clarification on what specifically you would like extracted into the JSON format. I'm happy to assist further once I have additional details to work with. Let me know if you can provide a text excerpt or other information source and I can construct the JSON object from there.
