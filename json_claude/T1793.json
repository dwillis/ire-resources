 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "T1793",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Debbie Wolfe",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "St. Petersburg Times"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Search Engine Features Comparison Chart",
  "description": "A chart comparing the features of various search engines including Google, Yahoo, AltaVista, Excite, HotBot, AllTheWeb and RefDesk.",
  "keywords": [
    "search engines",
    "comparison",
    "features",
    "Google", 
    "Yahoo"
  ] 
}
```

I extracted the author name and affiliation from the byline. Since no email or conference/year were listed, I set those values to null or "Not Listed". The description summarizes the main topic in two sentences, and the keywords list the main search engines covered along with the key aspects being compared (search engines, comparison, features).
