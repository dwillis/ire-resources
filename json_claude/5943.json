 Unfortunately I do not have enough context to generate a full JSON object from the prompt. The prompt asks to extract information from "the input" and "the text", but does not provide any actual input text to analyze. If you could provide the specific text you would like me to parse into a JSON object, I would be happy to attempt creating the object with the requested keys and attributes. Without any input text, I do not have sufficient information to populate the JSON object. Please provide the text you would like parsed and I can try my best to create the JSON format you described.
