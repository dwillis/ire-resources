 Here is the JSON object created from the input text:

```json
{
   "id": "3477",
   "authors":[
      {
         "name":null,
         "email":null,
         "affiliation":"St. Paul Pioneer Press"
      }
   ],
   "conference":"NICAR",
   "year":"2011",
   "title":"Ready when the story breaks",
   "description":"The author provides tips on using data for breaking news stories, including key resources to research in advance.",
   "keywords":[
      "data",
      "breaking news", 
      "reporting",
      "resources",
      "tips"
   ]
}
```

I included the news organization the author is from as their affiliation, since no other affiliation was listed. The description summarizes the key focus of the text. And I selected 5 relevant keywords to characterize the content.
