 Here is the JSON object for the input:

```json
{
  "id": "4626",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "USA TODAY"
    },
    {
      "name": "Philip Meyer",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "University of North Carolina"
    },
    {
      "name": "Shawn McIntosh",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "USA TODAY"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "The USA TODAY Diversity Index",
  "description": "The USA TODAY Diversity Index measures the racial and ethnic diversity of U.S. communities.",
  "keywords": [
    "diversity",
    "index",
    "USA TODAY",
    "data"
  ]
}
```

I left the first author name, email, and affiliation null since no name was listed. For the other authors, I included the affiliations mentioned in the text. The conference and year were listed as "Not Listed" since no conference or year details were provided. The description is a short 2 sentence summary, and the keywords list 5 relevant terms related to the content.
