 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "3368",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "Missouri School of Journalism"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Mapping data quickly and easily",
  "description": "A presentation giving an overview of several free and easy-to-use online mapping tools for journalists.",
  "keywords": [
    "mapping",
    "data",
    "visualization",
    "geocoding",
    "journalism"
  ]
}
```

My logic:
- Set id to 3368
- The author name is not listed, but the affiliation Missouri School of Journalism is mentioned, so I used that for the single authors object
- The conference is listed as NICAR
- No clear year is given, so set to Not Listed
- The title is taken from the first header
- The description summarizes the main topic in two sentences  
- Picked 5 relevant keywords from the content
