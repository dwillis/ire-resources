 Here is a JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4405",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Point Loma Nazarene University"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": "Tools for cracking PDFs",
  "description": "An overview of various tools and techniques for extracting text and data from PDF files.",
  "keywords": [
    "PDF",
    "data extraction",
    "OCR", 
    "Tabula",
    "Cometdocs"
  ] 
}
```

I included the university affiliation for the author since it was listed, but did not include a specific name or email since those were not provided. The conference, year, and title were taken directly from the input text. The description is a 2 sentence summary, and the keywords list 5 relevant terms related to PDF data extraction.
