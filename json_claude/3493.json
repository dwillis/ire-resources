 Here is the JSON object for the text:

```json
{
  "id": "3493",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "John Stasko", "email": null, "affiliation": "Georgia Institute of Technology"}, 
    {"name": "Carsten GÃ¶rg", "email": null, "affiliation": "Georgia Institute of Technology"},
    {"name": "Zhicheng Liu", "email": null, "affiliation": "Georgia Institute of Technology"},
    {"name": "Youn-ah Kang", "email": null, "affiliation": "Georgia Institute of Technology"},
    {"name": "Jaeyeon Kihm", "email": null, "affiliation": "Georgia Institute of Technology"}
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2011",
  "title": "Jigsaw",
  "description": "Jigsaw is a tool to help investigators explore and understand large document collections by visualizing connections between entities extracted from the documents.",
  "keywords": ["visualization", "analysis", "documents", "entities", "connections"]
}
```

I extracted the conference, year, and author information from the text. The description is a 1-2 sentence summary, and the keywords list relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON object!
