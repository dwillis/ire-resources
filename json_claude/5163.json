 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5163",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Ohio University"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Introduction to Excel",
  "description": "A tutorial demonstrating basic Excel functions like filtering, sorting, calculating averages and percentages.",
  "keywords": [
    "Excel",
    "data analysis", 
    "filtering",
    "sorting",
    "formulas",
    "calculations"
  ]
}
```

To summarize the key details:

- Id is set to 5163
- Single author from Ohio University
- Conference and year not listed
- Title and affiliation extracted 
- Brief 1-2 sentence description 
- Keywords identify main topics covered

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON structure!
