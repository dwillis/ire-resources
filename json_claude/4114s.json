 Unfortunately I do not have the full text to extract detailed metadata from. Based on the instructions provided, here is an example JSON object I could create:

```json
{
  "id": "4114s",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": []
}
```

I would need the full text in order to populate the authors, description, title, and keywords fields. Please provide the text and I can attempt to extract the requested metadata into a JSON object.
