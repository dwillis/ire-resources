 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "T2743",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "Tips for investigative journalists to find good stories, build sources, and report credible information.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative journalism", 
    "reporting",
    "sources",
    "credibility",
    "interviews"
  ]
}
```

I made a 1-2 sentence summary for the description, used "Not Listed" for the conference and year since those details were not provided, did not include any author info since no names were listed, and listed 5 relevant keywords to capture main topics from the tips. The id is set to T2743 as requested. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON!
