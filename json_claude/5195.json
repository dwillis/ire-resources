 Here is the JSON object created from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "5195",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "THE NATIONAL REGISTRY OF EXONERATIONS",
  "description": "The National Registry of Exonerations collects and publishes data on known exonerations of innocent defendants in the U.S. since 1989.",
  "keywords": [
    "exonerations", 
    "false convictions", 
    "data",
    "research",
    "REGISTRY"
  ]
}
```

I set the conference and year values to "Not Listed" since those details were not clearly identified in the text. The authors name, email and affiliation were also not provided so I left them null. The description is a 1-2 sentence summary, and keywords are relevant terms from the text limited to 5 non-duplicate terms.
