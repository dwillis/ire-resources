 Here is the JSON object created from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4739",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "ProPublica"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "2016",
  "title": "My Favorite Health Data Sets",  
  "description": "The tweet shares links to various health data sets and resources that are publicly available.",
  "keywords": [
    "health data", 
    "data sets",
    "resources",
    "tipsheets",
    "inspection reports",
    "opioid epidemic",
    "pharma payments",
    "privacy violations"
  ]  
}
```

I left the author name as null since none was listed, used ProPublica as the affiliation since that matched the Twitter account, summarized the content in the description, and listed relevant keywords. The conference and year were not clearly stated in the text so I put default values. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON!
