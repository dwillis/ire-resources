 Unfortunately there is not enough information provided in the text to create a complete JSON object with all the requested keys and nested objects. The text does not contain any author names, emails, or affiliations. It also does not list a conference, year, or description to summarize the content. 

Based on the instructions, here is an attempt at creating a partial JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "5582",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null 
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Think like a researcher",
  "description": "Tips for doing background research as a journalist.",
  "keywords": [
    "research",
    "journalism",
    "verification"
  ]
}
```

Please provide more detailed source text, especially information about authors, conference details, and a summary, in order to generate a complete JSON object per the instructions.
