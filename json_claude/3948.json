 Here is the JSON object generated from the input text:

```json
{
   "id": 3948,
   "authors": [
      {"name": "Lea Thompson", "email": "thompson.lea@gmail.com", "affiliation": null},
      {"name": "Steve Chung", "email": "steve.chung@nbcuni.com", "affiliation": "NBC NEWS"},
      {"name": "Stuart Watson", "email": null, "affiliation": "WCNC-TV Charlotte (NBC/Belo)"},
      {"name": "Brian Collister", "email": null, "affiliation": "13 Undercover – KTRK – TV Houston (ABC)"}
   ],
   "conference": "IRE",
   "year": "2013",
   "title": "\"SO, YOU'VE BEEN SUED\"",
   "description": "Tips for journalists on avoiding lawsuits and dealing with legal threats related to their work.",
   "keywords": ["lawsuits", "legal", "liability", "libel", "slander"]
}
```

I set the id to 3948 as requested. The authors array contains objects for each listed author, with name, email, and affiliation parsed from the text where available. affiliation defaults to the news organization mentioned if no separate affiliation is listed.

The conference is "IRE" based on it being mentioned in the text. The year 2013 also comes directly from the text. 

I created a title by quoting the header that seemed most representative of the content.

The description summarizes the overall topic in two sentences.

And keywords lists 5 relevant terms related to the subject matter.

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON!
