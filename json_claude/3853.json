 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

    "description": "The U.S. has detained migrant children in hotels before expelling them from the country.",
    "keywords": ["migrant", "children", "hotels", "expelled", "immigration"]
}

I included "The Associated Press" as the one author's affiliation since the text mentions the AP. The conference and year are "Not Listed" since those details are not provided. The description summarizes that migrant children are being held in hotels and then expelled from the country. The keywords list relevant terms from the content.
