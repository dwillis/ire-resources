 Unfortunately I do not have enough context to generate the full JSON object you requested based on the information provided. To create an accurate JSON response, I would need the full text or other source content that I could analyze and extract the necessary details from. Please provide the full text or other source content, and I would be happy to parse it and generate the JSON object with the requested keys and attributes. Without access to the underlying content, I cannot confidently populate details like the authors, descriptions, keywords, etc. Let me know if you can share that source information so I can assist further.
