 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "2876",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": null},
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "Cleveland Plain Dealer"}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "USING SOLUTIONS JOURNALISM IN INVESTIGATIONS",
  "description": "Article discusses adding solutions-based reporting to investigations to strengthen them.",
  "keywords": ["investigations", "solutions", "reporting", "journalism", "stories"]  
}
```

I summarized the key points about using solutions journalism to strengthen investigations in the description, and extracted a few topical keywords. Since no specific conference or year was listed, I put "Not Listed" for those fields. The one identifiable affiliation was the Cleveland Plain Dealer, which I added for the second author.
