 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "4122",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null, 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Bay Area News Group"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text discusses lessons learned and best practices for building news applications.",
  "keywords": [
    "news",
    "applications", 
    "development",
    "best practices"
  ]
}
```

I left the name and title values as null since no specific names or title were provided. The affiliation comes from the mention of the Bay Area News Group. The conference is NICAR based on the repository name. The year is listed as "Not Listed" since no specific year is given. The description is a brief 1-2 sentence summary of the main points. And keywords list some relevant terms related to the content.
