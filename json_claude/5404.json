 Here is the JSON object created from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "5404",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "NICAR"},
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "Politico"}, 
    {"name": "Ham Boardman", "email": null, "affiliation": "The NYT"},
    {"name": "Alastair Coote", "email": null, "affiliation": "The Guardian Mobile Innovation Lab"},
    {"name": "Tiff Fehr", "email": null, "affiliation": "The NYT"}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "2018",
  "title": "Evolving Forms and the Future of Live Coverage",
  "description": "Panel discusses evolving forms of live news coverage and their pros and cons.",
  "keywords": ["live", "coverage", "mobile", "future", "forms"]
}
```

I summarized the key points from the text to create the JSON object with the requested structure and attributes. I left name, email, and affiliation null when that information was not provided. For the description, I summarized the overall topic in a simple sentence. And for keywords, I chose 5 representative terms related to the content. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON.
