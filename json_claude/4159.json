 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4159",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Wall Street Journal"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Managing and Juggling Investigative Work",
  "description": "The text discusses strategies for managing long-term investigative journalism projects, keeping them moving, and getting stories published.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigation", 
    "journalism",
    "project management",
    "editing",
    "publishing"
  ]
}
```

I included The Wall Street Journal as the affiliation since the author is a deputy chief there. The description summarizes the main topics covered in the text. And I chose investigation, journalism, project management, editing, and publishing as relevant keywords.
