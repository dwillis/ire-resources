 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the text:

```json
{
  "id": 3466,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": 2011,
  "title": "Valet parking your Django app",
  "description": "Take a break from hosting your Django application by using services like Djangy and ep.io to simplify deployment.",
  "keywords": [
    "Django",
    "Djangy",
    "ep.io",
    "deployment",
    "hosting"
  ]
}
```

I included the key details about using Djangy and ep.io to deploy Django apps without needing to manage servers directly. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON structure!
