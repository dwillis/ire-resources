 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "Breaking_Disaster",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "IRE"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": "Breaking news and disaster coverage",
  "description": "Tips and strategies for covering breaking news events and disasters as a journalist.",
  "keywords": [
    "breaking news",
    "disasters",
    "coverage",
    "planning",
    "data"
  ]
}
```

I extracted "IRE" as the conference and affiliation since the text mentioned presenters from IRE. The year was not clearly listed, so I put "Not Listed". The description summarizes the main focus of the content. And I chose 5 relevant keywords related to the topic that weren't conference names or author details.
