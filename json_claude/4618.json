 Unfortunately I do not have access to the original text you referred to in order to generate the requested JSON object. If you could provide the text or a link to it, I would be happy to create the JSON summary object containing id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords based on the criteria you specified. Please let me know if you can supply the source text - thanks!
