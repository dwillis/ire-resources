 Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```json
{
  "id": "3895",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null, 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "IRE/NICAR"
    },
    {
     "name": "Jaimi Dowdell",
     "email": null,
     "affiliation": "IRE/NICAR"
    },
    {
     "name": "Jennifer LaFleur",
     "email": null, 
     "affiliation": "ProPublica"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Diagnosing Dirty Data",
  "description": "Guidelines for assessing quality of datasets, identifying common data issues, and basic approaches to data cleaning.",
  "keywords": [
    "data",
    "quality", 
    "cleaning",
    "assessment",
    "diagnostics"
  ]
}
```

I included affiliation for the first author as "IRE/NICAR" since that seems to be the hosts of the event. Let me know if you would like me to modify anything!
