  "title": null,
  "description": "Tips on tracking government spending through procurement databases and USAspending.gov.",
  "keywords": ["government", "spending", "procurement", "database", "USAspending"]
}
```

I extracted the author names and affiliations from the text. The conference is listed as NICAR. No specific year is given, so I put "Not Listed" for year. I created a short description summarizing the main topics. And I picked out 5 relevant keywords to describe the content.
