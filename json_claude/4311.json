 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4311",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Griff Palmer",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    },
    {
      "name": "Ricardo Brom",
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "La Nacion"
    },
    {
      "name": "Lisa Pickoff-White",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "KQED News"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "2015",
  "title": "Data From Scratch",
  "description": "Strategies for creating databases by hand entry or scraping when no data exists for stories with potential impact.",
  "keywords": ["data entry", "scraping", "health costs", "databases"] 
}
```

I extracted the author names when listed, used the news organization name as the affiliation when available, and summarized the main points in the description. The conference is NICAR based on the opening text, the year is 2015 though not directly stated, and I chose some relevant keywords. Let me know if you need any changes to this JSON structure.
