 Unfortunately there is not enough information provided in the text to create a full JSON object with all required keys. The text does not include any author names, email addresses, or affiliations. There is also no clear conference name or year listed. 

Here is an attempt at creating a partial JSON object with some of the available information:

```json
{
  "id": "4851",
  "authors": [], 
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Involving your audience in your investigation",
  "description": "Tips and strategies for crowdsourcing and engaging your audience in investigations.",
  "keywords": ["investigations", "engagement", "crowdsourcing", "audience"] 
}
```

I included relevant keywords based on the summary provided. But without more context or information from the original text, this is the best I can generate. Please let me know if you have any other information that could be used to populate additional keys like author details.
