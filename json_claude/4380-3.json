 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "3",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": "nicar­2015/population­data­2011.csv at master · githubteacher/nicar­2015 · GitHub",
  "description": "This CSV file contains US population data by city for 2010 and 2011.",
  "keywords": [
    "population",
    "US", 
    "cities",
    "data"
  ]
}
```

I left the author details blank since no authors were listed. The conference, year, and title are based on the content provided. The description summarizes the main details, and the keywords list relevant terms related to the content.
