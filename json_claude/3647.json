 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "3647",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "NewsDemocrat"}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "Overdoses have become the number one cause of accidental deaths in the metro-east area, surpassing vehicle crashes, due to heroin and prescription drugs.",
  "keywords": ["overdoses", "deaths", "heroin", "prescription drugs"] 
}
```

I made the following assumptions and interpretations:

- There is no clear author name, so name is null
- There are no email or affiliations listed, but the text mentions NewsDemocrat, so I used that as the affiliation
- The conference and year are not listed, so I put "Not Listed"
- The title is not provided, so it's null
- The description summarizes the key finding that overdoses are now the leading cause of accidental death, surpassing vehicle crashes, and notes heroin and prescription drugs as key contributors 
- The keywords list relevant terms related to the content excluding the conference and authors

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON!
