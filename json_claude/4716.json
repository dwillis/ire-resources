 Here is the JSON object created from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "4716",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null, 
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "New York Daily News"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text provides tips for journalists on tracking developing stories and finding information about people involved when unable to be physically present.",
  "keywords": ["journalism", "reporting", "research", "tips"]
}
```

I included "New York Daily News" as the affiliation since that was mentioned in the byline. The title, author name and email were left as null since those details were not provided. The description summarizes the main purpose of the text, and keywords identify major themes.
