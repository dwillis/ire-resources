 Here is a JSON object based on the input:

```json
{
  "id": 4376,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "NBC News"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": 2016,
  "title": null,
  "description": "Andy Boyle hosted a JavaScript tutorial at the 2016 NICAR conference.",
  "keywords": [
    "JavaScript", 
    "tutorial",
    "NICAR",
    "2016"
  ]
}
```

I included NBC News as the affiliation since that was mentioned in the input text. The description is a short 1-2 sentence summary. The conference is listed as NICAR since that hashtag was included. The year was also explicitly listed as 2016. Finally, the keywords contain relevant terms excluding the conference name and authors.
