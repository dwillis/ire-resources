 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
  "id": "3928",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Alejandra Xanic von Bertrab",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2013",
  "title": "Overview of the Mexican Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) laws",
  "description": "An overview of Mexico's federal and state freedom of information laws detailing what information is available, how to submit requests, and options for appeals.",
  "keywords": [
    "Mexico", 
    "FOIA",
    "freedom of information",
    "transparency",
    "government"
  ]
}
```

I extracted the conference name and year from the context provided. Since no author email or affiliation was given, I left those values as null. The description is a short summary of the main topics covered in the text. The keywords list several relevant terms related to the content.
