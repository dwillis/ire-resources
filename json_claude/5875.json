 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

{
    "id": "5875",
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": null,
            "email": null, 
            "affiliation": "Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press"
        }
    ],
    "conference": "IRE",
    "year": "2019",
    "title": "Resources Training",
    "description": "The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press provides free legal services and resources to journalists to help them exercise their First Amendment rights.",
    "keywords": ["legal", "resources", "First Amendment"]
}
