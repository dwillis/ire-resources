 Unfortunately I do not have access to the original text you referenced, so I cannot create the exact JSON object you described. However, here is an example JSON object with made up data matching the structure you outlined:

```json
{
  "id": "5528",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "John Smith",
      "email": "jsmith@newsorg.com",
      "affiliation": "Local News Organization"
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null  
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2022",
  "title": "Example news story",
  "description": "This is a short summary of the example news story.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative", 
    "data",
    "journalism",
    "reporting",
    "news"
  ]
}
```

The keys are:
- id: integer ID number 
- authors: list of objects with name, email, and affiliation attributes
- conference: "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed"
- year: year as an integer or "Not Listed"
- title: story title as a string
- description: short 1-2 sentence summary 
- keywords: list of no more than 5 keyword strings

Let me know if you have the original text and I can try generating the JSON object from that input!
