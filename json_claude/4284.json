 Unfortunately I do not have enough context to generate the full JSON object you described. From the quote, it seems you provided an excerpt about software development methodologies, but there is no additional text from which I can extract conference, year, title, etc. If you provide the full text you wish to extract information from, I would be happy to attempt creating the JSON object. For now, here is an example placeholder:

```json
{
  "id": "4284",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null 
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": []
}
```

Please let me know if you can provide more source text and details on the specific information to extract. I'd be glad to give it another try!
