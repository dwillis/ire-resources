 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "3015",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Ronald Campbell",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Orange County Register"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The author provides advice on how investigative journalists should organize their work to ensure every detail of a story is traceable to a document or source.",
  "keywords": [
    "journalism",
    "investigative",
    "reporting",
    "documentation",
    "sources"
  ]
}
```

I extracted the author's name, email (none provided), and affiliation from the introductory lines. Since no conference or year is listed, I put "Not Listed" for those keys. There is no clear title, so I left that null. The description summarizes the main point in a couple sentences. For keywords, I selected 5 terms related to the content that aren't just the conference or author names.
