 Unfortunately I do not have the full text to extract detailed metadata from. Based on the limited information provided, here is a sample JSON object with made up data:

{
  "id": "4086_1",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "John Smith",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Local News" 
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "2022",
  "title": "Data Journalism Techniques",
  "description": "A panel discussion on using data analysis for investigative reporting.",
  "keywords": ["data", "journalism", "reporting", "investigation"] 
}

I included a fake author name and affiliation, listed NICAR as the conference, put the current year as no other was provided, made up a title and description, and included some relevant keywords. Without more context or the full text, this is just an example structure, but hopefully illustrates what you were looking for. Let me know if you have any other questions!
