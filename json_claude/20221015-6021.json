 Unfortunately there is not enough context in the prompt to provide a complete JSON object. The prompt refers to extracting information from some unspecified "input" text, but does not include any sample text. Without that, I cannot accurately extract things like author names, affiliations, a description, keywords, etc.

The best I can do is provide a basic JSON structure with some placeholder values:

```json
{
  "id": "6021",
  "authors": [], 
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": []
}
```

If an actual text sample were provided to extract information from, I could populate this structure appropriately. But without any text to analyze, most of the keys requiring extracted data need to remain null or empty arrays. Please provide the text you would like analyzed and I would be happy to process it into the requested JSON format.
