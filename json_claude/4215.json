 Unfortunately I do not have enough context to generate a full JSON object from the input text. To create an accurate JSON response, I would need more details on the source content, such as author names, conference names, publication dates, etc. Without additional context, any JSON I could generate would be incomplete or include fabricated details. If you are able to provide more complete source information, I would be happy to try again to create a JSON object that meets your specifications. Please let me know if you can clarify the source material and provide any missing details.
