 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

{
    "id": "5655",
    "authors": [
        {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "NBC Owned Television Stations"}
    ],
    "conference": "IRE", 
    "year": "2018",
    "title": "Intro to R",
    "description": "A workshop teaching journalists how to use the R programming language and tools like the tidyverse package to analyze data.",
    "keywords": ["R", "programming", "data analysis", "workshop"]  
}
