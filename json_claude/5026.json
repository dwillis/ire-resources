 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the text:

```json
{
  "id": "5026",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Ken Schwencke", "email": null, "affiliation": "The Los Angeles Times"}, 
    {"name": "John Keefe", "email": null, "affiliation": "WNYC"},
    {"name": "Simon Rogers", "email": null, "affiliation": "The Guardian"}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "2017",
  "title": "\"The Present & Future of Bots\"â€” NICAR, 2017",
  "description": "A panel discusses current uses of bots in journalism and speculates on future applications.",
  "keywords": ["bots", "journalism", "technology", "future"]
}
```

I included the named panelists as the authors along with their affiliations. Since no email addresses were listed, I put those as null. The conference name and year were clearly identified in the text. For the description, I summarized the main topic of discussion. And for keywords, I chose some topical words related to the panel.
