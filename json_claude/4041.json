 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the text:

{
  "id": "4041",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Introduction to d3.js",
  "description": "This text introduces basic concepts and usage of the d3.js data visualization JavaScript library.",
  "keywords": [
    "d3.js",
    "data visualization", 
    "JavaScript"
  ]
}

I left the author name, email, and affiliation as null since no author information was provided. The conference is listed as NICAR, and the year is unspecified so I put "Not Listed". The title and description are based on my interpretation of the overall text, and the keywords list some of the main topics covered without repeating the conference name.
