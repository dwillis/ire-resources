 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input:

```json
{
  "id": 5000,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null, 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "CNN"
    },
    {
      "name": null, 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "NPR"
    },
    {
      "name": null, 
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "Los Angeles Times"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The speakers introduced dailygraphics, a framework for building small, embeddable graphics for news stories.",
  "keywords": [
    "data visualization",
    "graphics",
    "news"
  ]
}
```

I left the title as null since there didn't seem to be a clear title provided in the text. Let me know if you would like me to modify or add anything to this JSON object!
