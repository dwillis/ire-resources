 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "T1995",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Ted Mellnik", "email": null, "affiliation": "Charlotte Observer"}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2004",
  "title": "Airline maintenance and safety",
  "description": "A newspaper investigation found that faulty airline maintenance has been a growing factor in fatal crashes over the past decade.",
  "keywords": ["airlines", "crashes", "maintenance", "safety", "investigation"]
}
```

I included the author name and affiliation from the Charlotte Observer mentioned at the end. The description summarizes the main findings. And I chose relevant keywords related to the topic that weren't the conference or author names.
