 Here is the JSON object created from the input text:

{
    "id": "5116",
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": "Erica Byfield",
            "email": null,
            "affiliation": "WNBC-TV"
        }
    ],
    "conference": "IRE",
    "year": "Not Listed", 
    "title": "BREAKING NEWS",
    "description": "A journalist provides tips on covering breaking news stories and finding exclusive information.",
    "keywords": [
        "breaking news", 
        "investigative reporting",
        "databases", 
        "resources",
        "tips"
    ]
}

I parsed the text to identify the author name and affiliation, inferred this was from an IRE conference based on the reference, and did not find a clear year. The description summarizes the overall content, and the keywords capture some of the major topics covered. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON structure!
