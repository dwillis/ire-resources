 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4820",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Irwin Redlener",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "National Center for Disaster Preparedness"
    },
    {
      "name": "Jeff Schlegelmilch",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "National Center for Disaster Preparedness"
    },
    {
      "name": "Sabine Marx",
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "National Center for Disaster Preparedness"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text discusses challenges journalists face in covering disaster preparedness and recovery, and suggests potential stories to investigate.",
  "keywords": [
    "disaster", 
    "preparedness",
    "recovery",
    "journalism",
    "infrastructure"
  ]
}
```

I extracted the author names, emails, and affiliations from the sign-off section at the end. Since no conference name or year was listed, I put "Not Listed" for those fields. The description summarizes the overall content, and the keywords list some major topics covered without repeating the authors or conference.
