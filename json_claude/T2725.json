 Here is the JSON object created from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "T2725",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Burnis Morris", "email": null, "affiliation": "Marshall University"},
    {"name": "Ronald Campbell", "email": null, "affiliation": "OC Register"},
    {"name": "Paul Clolery", "email": null, "affiliation": "NonProfit Times"}
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Beyond Bake Sales: Investigating Nonprofits",
  "description": "The panel discusses investigating nonprofits, which have huge assets and touch many social issues.",
  "keywords": ["assets", "revenue", "hospitals", "universities", "social issues"]
}
```

I summarized the key points about nonprofits being large and influential organizations that merit journalistic investigation. I included the most prominent examples and topics mentioned as keywords. Since the year was not clearly identified, I put "Not Listed" for year. The id is set to T2725 and the conference to IRE based on the context. The authors are included with available name and affiliations.
