 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "T2704",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Chris Henao", 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "KHOU, Houston, TX"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",  
  "title": "DIDN'T I JUST SEE THAT. HOW TO KEEP INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS FRESH",
  "description": "Tips from an investigative journalist on how to keep stories fresh when the topic has been previously reported, such as focusing on new angles and details.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative journalism", 
    "story angles",
    "details",
    "forensics"
  ] 
}
```

I extracted the author name, email, and affiliation from the contact information. Since no conference or year was listed, I put "Not Listed" for those fields. The description summarizes the main content, and the keywords list some topical terms excluding the conference and author information.
