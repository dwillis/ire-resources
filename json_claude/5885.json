 Here is the JSON object created from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5885",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "KPRC-TV"
    },
    {
      "name": "Jason Knowles",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "WLS-TV"
    },
    {
      "name": "Nydia Han",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2019",
  "title": "Consumer Investigations",
  "description": "Tips and story ideas for quick turn and long form consumer investigations that educate viewers, hold bad actors accountable and solve problems.",
  "keywords": [
    "consumers",
    "investigations", 
    "scams",
    "tips",
    "stories"
  ]
}
```

I extracted the relevant information from the text to populate the keys and values in the JSON object as specified in the instructions. The id is 5885. The authors list contains the names and affiliations mentioned. The conference is "IRE". The year is listed as "2019" based on the context. The title and description summarize the main topic. And the keywords list relevant terms. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON object!
