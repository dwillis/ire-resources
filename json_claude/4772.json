 Unfortunately I don't have the full text to extract structured data from. Based on the snippets provided, here is an attempt at a JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "4772",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR16", 
  "year": "2016",
  "title": "Regular Expressions and OpenRefine",
  "description": "A tutorial on using regular expressions and OpenRefine to clean data.",
  "keywords": [
    "regular expressions",
    "openrefine", 
    "data cleaning"
  ] 
}
```

I've included some default values where information is missing from the snippets, like null authors and keywords based on the terms mentioned. The conference is listed as "NICAR16" and the year as "2016". The description is a short 1-2 sentence summary. Let me know if you need any clarification or have the full text to extract a more accurate JSON object!
