 Unfortunately I do not have access to the original text you referred to, so I cannot extract the requested information. However, here is an example JSON object with made up data matching your specifications:

```json
{
  "id": "5447",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "John Smith",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Local Times"
    },
    {
      "name": null, 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2019",
  "title": "My Graphics App Tutorial",
  "description": "A tutorial teaching how to build a simple graphics application.",
  "keywords": [
    "javascript",
    "html",
    "css",
    "graphics"
  ]
}
```

The id is 5447, there are two authors with only one having a name and affiliation, the conference is NICAR, the year is 2019, and there are four keywords. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional example text you would like me to parse!
