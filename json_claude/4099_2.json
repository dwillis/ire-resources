 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the text:

```json
{
  "id": "4099_2",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null, 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Associated Press"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The Associated Press used data to show the impact of the government shutdown on services.",
  "keywords": ["government", "shutdown", "services", "data"] 
}
```

I left the title and authors name as null since they were not provided. The affiliation comes from the mention of The Associated Press. The description summarizes the main point. And the keywords list some relevant terms. The conference and year are "Not Listed" since those details were not given.
