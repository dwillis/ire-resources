 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "T2346",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The New York Times"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Beyond Google: The invisible Web and other secrets of the online world",
  "description": "Tips and resources for searching beyond Google, including alternative search engines, databases, public records, maps, blogs, and sites to find new and updated information online.",
  "keywords": [
    "search engines", 
    "databases", 
    "public records",
    "maps",
    "blogs"
  ]
}
```

I left the author name and email as null since no name was listed, used "The New York Times" as the affiliation since that was mentioned, put "NICAR" as the conference, and "Not Listed" as the year since no specific year was given. The description is a 1-2 sentence summary, and the keywords list 5 main terms related to the various resources covered. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON!
