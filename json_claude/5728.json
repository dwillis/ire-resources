 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5728",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Hilke Schellmann",
      "email": "hilke.schellmann@nyu.edu",
      "affiliation": "NYU"
    },
    {
      "name": "Ryan Gabrielson",
      "email": "ryan.gabrielson@propublica.org",
      "affiliation": "ProPublica"
    },
    {
      "name": "Sam Ellis",
      "email": "sam@vox.com",
      "affiliation": "Vox"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Bring your investigative reporting to life using animation",
  "description": "The presenters discuss techniques for turning investigative journalism into explanatory animations and comics.",
  "keywords": [
    "animation",
    "comics",
    "explainer",
    "investigative reporting",
    "visual storytelling"
  ]
}
```

I parsed the name, email, and affiliation where available from the text. Since a conference year was not listed, I put "Not Listed" for the year key. The description is a 1-2 sentence summary of the main topic. And the keywords list several relevant terms related to the content.
