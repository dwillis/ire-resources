 Here is the JSON object created from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "4892_2",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Associated Press"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "UNCOVERING STORIES ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL BEAT",
  "description": "Tips for covering stories on the environment in Kenya, focusing on the impact on Lake Turkana.",
  "keywords": [
    "Kenya",
    "environment",
    "Lake Turkana",
    "fishing",
    "climate"
  ]
}
```

I set the conference and year to "Not Listed" since those details were not clearly provided. The authors list has a single entry with null name, email, and an affiliation based on the reference to the Associated Press. The description is a short 1-2 sentence summary, and keywords list 5 relevant terms from the content.
