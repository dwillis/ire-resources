 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5797",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Michael Beckel", 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Issue One"
    },
    {
      "name": "Anna Massoglia",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Center for Responsive Politics"
    },
    {
      "name": "Andrew Perez",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "MapLight"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2019",
  "title": "Tracking dark money tips",
  "description": "The text provides tips and resources for tracking dark money spending in U.S. elections.",
  "keywords": [
    "dark money",
    "tracking",
    "resources",
    "elections",
    "spending"
  ]
}
```

I extracted the conference, year, and author details from the text. I generated a 1-2 sentence summary for the description, and selected 5 relevant keywords. All keys and values are enclosed in quotemarks. Let me know if you need any changes to this JSON object.
