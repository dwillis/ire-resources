 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "T2358",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Danielle Cervantes", "email": null, "affiliation": "The San Diego Union-Tribune"},
    {"name": "Paul Overberg", "email": null, "affiliation": "USA TODAY"}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2005",
  "title": "ACS: Get ready for the Every-year Census!",
  "description": "The text provides an overview and tips for journalists regarding the transition from the traditional 10-year US Census to the new American Community Survey released annually.",
  "keywords": ["census", "demographics", "data", "trends", "methodology"]
}
```

I set the conference to "NICAR" and the year to "2005" based on the first paragraph. For the description, I summarized the key points about the transition to the ACS. And for keywords, I pulled out some of the main themes related to the census data.
