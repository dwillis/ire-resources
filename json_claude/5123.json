 Unfortunately there is no text input provided to extract information from. To create the requested JSON object, I will make assumptions about some default values:

```json
{
  "id": "5123",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": []
}
```

Please provide the text input and I will attempt to extract the requested information to populate the JSON object. Without input text, I can only provide this placeholder JSON with default values. Let me know if you have any other questions!
