 Here is the JSON object created from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5758",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "Reuters"
    },
    {
     "name": "Nathaniel Lash",
     "email": null,
     "affiliation": "Philadelphia Inquirer"
    },
    {
     "name": "Casey Miller",
     "email": null,
     "affiliation": "Los Angeles Times"
    },
    {
     "name": "Jasmine Lee",
     "email": null,
     "affiliation": "New York Times"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "A discussion among journalists about data visualization and chart literacy.",
  "keywords": [
    "data",
    "visualization", 
    "charts",
    "literacy",
    "journalism"
  ]
}
```

I created authors array with affiliations for each person listed. The conference, year and title were not specified, so I set those values to "Not Listed". The description is a short 1-2 sentence summary of the text. Finally, I created a keywords list with relevant terms excluding conference and authors.
