 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "T2063",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Mark Katches",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Orange County Register"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": "Testing as an investigative technique",
  "description": "The text discusses product testing strategies used by The Orange County Register in an investigation of lead contamination in Mexican candy.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative journalism",
    "product testing", 
    "data analysis",
    "lead contamination",
    "Mexican candy"
  ]
}
```

I extracted the only clear author name and affiliation from the text. Since no conference, year or email is listed, I put "Not Listed" or null values for those fields. The description summarizes the key points, and the keywords list salient topics covered without duplicating information already captured.
