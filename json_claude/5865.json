 Unfortunately there is not enough context in the prompt to extract all the requested information. Based on the limited information provided, here is an attempt at creating the requested JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "5865",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null  
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": []
}
```

I've included the requested keys, set the id to 5865, and created an empty authors array and keywords list since no author names or other specifics were provided. The conference, year, title and description are set to "Not Listed" or null since no text was provided to summarize or extract those details from.

If more context or actual text is provided in a prompt, I would be happy to try again to extract the requested details to populate the JSON object. Please let me know if you have any other questions!
