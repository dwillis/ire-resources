 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "6068",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text does not contain enough information to create a 1-2 sentence summary.",
  "keywords": [] 
}
```

I left most values as null or empty since the input text did not contain the necessary information. The conference and year are set to "Not Listed", and the description states that there is not enough information to summarize. Please let me know if you would like me to modify anything in this JSON object.
