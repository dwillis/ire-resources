 Here is the JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "5135",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "ESPN"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2017", 
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text provides contact information and tips for obtaining records from universities.",
  "keywords": [
    "universities", 
    "public records",
    "campus police",
    "FERPA"
  ]
}
```

I set the conference to "IRE" since the email address contains "@espn.com", suggesting the text is from an investigative reporter. The year is set to "2017" based on "IRE 2017" in the original text. The description summarizes the main topics covered, and the keywords list several major themes. Since no formal title or author name were provided, those values are set to null.
