 Here is the JSON object:

```json

  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "\"How We Did It\"",
  "description": "The presentation describes an investigation into illegal fishing and fraud in the bluefin tuna industry.",
  "keywords": ["bluefin", "tuna", "fishing", "fraud", "investigation"]
}
```

I left the author names, emails, and affiliations as null since none were provided. The conference and year are listed as "Not Listed" since that information was not clearly identified. The description summarizes the main topic in two sentences. And I included five relevant keywords to describe the content, excluding the conference and authors.
