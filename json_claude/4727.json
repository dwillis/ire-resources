 Unfortunately I do not have access to the full text that was provided to generate the requested JSON object. Based on the instructions, here is an example JSON object I could generate with made up placeholder data:

```json
{
  "id": "4727",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "BBC"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "2016",
  "title": "Creating Flythroughs with Google Earth",
  "description": "A tutorial on how to create flythrough videos using Google Earth.",
  "keywords": [
    "Google Earth", 
    "flythrough",
    "video",
    "tutorial"
  ] 
}
```

I would need to see the full text to extract the actual author names, emails, affiliations and an accurate summary and keywords. Please provide the source text and I can generate the JSON object with the requested details.
