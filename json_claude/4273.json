 Unfortunately I do not have enough context to confidently create a JSON object from this text. The text does not clearly contain structured data with labels like "id", "authors", "conference", etc. If you could provide more explicitly structured data, or clarify exactly which parts of the text correspond to which JSON keys, I would be happy to try formatting it as JSON. Without additional context or structure, making those associations would require making unsupported assumptions. Please let me know if you can provide any clarification on the mapping between this text and the requested JSON format.
