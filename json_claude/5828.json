 Unfortunately I do not have the full text to extract detailed information from. Based on the limited information provided, here is a sample JSON object I could create:

```json
{
  "id": "5828",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null  
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": []
}
```

I attempted to follow the instructions provided to create keys for id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. Without any text to summarize or extract keywords from, those values are left null or empty. Please provide the full text you would like analyzed and I would be happy to extract the requested details to populate the JSON object.
