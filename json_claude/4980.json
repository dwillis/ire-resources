 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4980",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Tom McGinty", "email": null, "affiliation": "Wall Street Journal"}, 
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "2017",
  "title": "Marrying documents and data\n(aka Investigative Reporting)",
  "description": "Tom McGinty of the Wall Street Journal discusses investigative reporting techniques involving documents and data at the 2017 CAR Conference.",
  "keywords": ["investigative reporting", "documents", "data", "analysis"] 
}
```

I included the key details from the text like the author name, his affiliation, the conference name and year, and created a short description and list of relevant keywords. The id is set to 4980 as requested. I left additional author details blank since they were not provided.
