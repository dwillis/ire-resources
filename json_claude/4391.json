 Here is the JSON object created from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "4391",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": null},
    {"name": "Thomas Hargrove", "email": null, "affiliation": "Scripps News"},
    {"name": "John Perry", "email": null, "affiliation": "Atlanta Journal-Constitution"}, 
    {"name": "Janet Roberts", "email": null, "affiliation": "Reuters"},
    {"name": "Jennifer LaFleur", "email": null, "affiliation": "Reveal | The Center for Investigative Reporting"}
  ],
  "conference": "IRE", 
  "year": "2015",
  "title": "",
  "description": "The text discusses doing integrity checks on data from your desk before publishing or reporting.",
  "keywords": ["integrity", "checks", "data", "publishing", "reporting"]  
}
```

I parsed the author names and affiliations where available. The conference was identified as IRE and a year of 2015 was listed. I created a short description summarizing the main topic. And I extracted 5 relevant keywords. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON.
