 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4185",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Daniel Gilbert", "email": null, "affiliation": "The Wall Street Journal"},
    {"name": "Eric Eyre", "email": null, "affiliation": "Charleston (W. VA.) Gazette"}, 
    {"name": "Liam Dillon", "email": null, "affiliation": "Voice of San Diego"},
    {"name": "Kate Martin", "email": null, "affiliation": "The News Tribune, Tacoma, Wash."}
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2014",
  "title": "Small newsrooms, big stories: Doing investigations with limited resources",
  "description": "The session provided tips on pursuing investigative projects at news organizations with limited resources.",
  "keywords": ["investigations", "resources", "data", "records"]  
}
```

I extracted the key information from the text to populate the JSON object with the requested structure and attributes. The description summarizes the overall topic, and the keywords list relevant terms related to the content.
