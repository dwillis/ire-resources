 Unfortunately there is not enough information in the text you provided for me to create a detailed JSON object with all the requested keys. The text does not contain any author names, affiliations, or other specifics. Here is a basic JSON object with some of the requested keys filled in, but most values set to "Not Listed" since the details were not present:

{
  "id": "5013",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Not Listed",
  "description": "The provided text does not contain enough information to summarize.",
  "keywords": [] 
}

Please provide more detailed textual input, ideally containing author names, conference details, etc., for me to populate a richer JSON object per your specifications. I'd be happy to try again with more complete source text.
