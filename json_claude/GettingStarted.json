 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "GettingStarted",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "IRE"},
    {"name": "Jaimi Dowdell", "email": null, "affiliation": null},
    {"name": "Rob O'Dell", "email": null, "affiliation": "Arizona Daily Star"},
    {"name": "Ang√©lica Peralta Ramos", "email": null, "affiliation": "LA NACION"}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The speakers discuss strategies for making the most out of a data journalism conference, including attending relevant sessions, networking effectively, and setting realistic goals.",
  "keywords": ["conference", "data journalism", "tips"]
}
```

I left the title as null since there did not seem to be a clear title provided in the text. For the description, I summarized the main themes around getting started and having a successful conference experience. The keywords reflect some of the major topics, excluding the conference name and author affiliations.

Please let me know if you would like me to modify or improve the JSON object in any way!
