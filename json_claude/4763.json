 Unfortunately I do not have enough context to construct the full JSON object you described. The text provided does not contain clear information about a conference, year, title, or description. I can provide a partial JSON object with some of the keys you specified:

```json
{
  "id": "4763",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Reporter's Committee for Freedom of the Press" 
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Not Listed",
  "description": "Not Listed",
  "keywords": [
    "freedom of information", 
    "public records",
    "data"
  ] 
}
```

Please provide more detailed textual content, and I would be happy to construct the full JSON object with all required keys and nesting. Let me know if you have any other questions!
