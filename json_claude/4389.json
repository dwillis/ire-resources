 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the text:

```json
{
  "id": "4389",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "National Public Radio"}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "2015",
  "title": "Processes, standards and documentation for data-driven projects",
  "description": "The text discusses best practices for automation, standards, and documentation when working on data journalism projects in order to minimize errors, ensure consistency, maintain transparency, and facilitate collaboration.",
  "keywords": ["automation", "standards", "documentation", "data journalism"]
}
```

I included "National Public Radio" as the one affiliation since the text mentioned NPR. The conference is listed as NICAR, and the year 2015 is also clearly identified. The description summarizes the key points, and I chose automation, standards, documentation, and data journalism as relevant keywords. Let me know if you would like me to modify or improve the JSON object in any way!
