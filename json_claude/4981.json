 Here is the JSON object created from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "4981",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "ProPublica"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": "Scraping committee hearing testimony from Capitol websites",
  "description": "The text discusses scraping data from state legislature websites.",
  "keywords": [
    "scraping",
    "testimony",
    "hearings",
    "legislature",
    "websites"
  ]
}
```

I set the conference to "NICAR" based on context clues in the text. The year is listed as "Not Listed" since no specific year for the conference is provided. The description summarizes the key point of the text, and keywords list relevant terms excluding conference and authors.
