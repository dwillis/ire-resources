 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

{
    "id": 4254,
    "authors": [
        {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "Jackson Walker L.L.P."}
    ],
    "conference": "Not Listed", 
    "year": "Not Listed",
    "title": "Freedom of Information Laws for Journalists",
    "description": "Overview of freedom of information laws and how journalists can utilize them to access government records.",
    "keywords": ["freedom of information", "FOIA", "journalism", "government", "records"]
}
