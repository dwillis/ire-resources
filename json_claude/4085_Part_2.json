 Here is the JSON object:

```json
{
   "id":"4085_Part_2",
   "authors":[
      {"name":null, "email":null, "affiliation":"Associated Press"},
      {"name":"Jack Gillum", "email":"jgillum@ap.org", "affiliation":"Associated Press"}, 
      {"name":"Aaron Bycoffe","email":"bycoffe@huffingtonpost.com","affiliation":"Huffington Post"},
      {"name":"Christopher Schnaars", "email":"cschnaars@usatoday.com", "affiliation":"USA TODAY"}
   ],
   "conference":"NICAR",
   "year":"Not Listed",
   "title":null,
   "description":"How to read campaign finance reports, find and download the data, identify key information, and use online tools to analyze the data.",
   "keywords":[
      "campaign finance",
      "FEC",
      "data",
      "Senate",
      "tools"
   ]
}
```

I left the title as null since there was no clear title provided in the text. The conference was identified as NICAR. The year was not clearly listed, so I put "Not Listed". The description summarizes the main topics covered. And I included 5 relevant keywords.
