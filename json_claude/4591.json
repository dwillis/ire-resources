 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
  "id": 4591,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Jennifer Cobb", 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "KHOU-TV"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Seven Tips for Managing an Investigative Team",
  "description": "Tips for executive producers on managing an investigative news team, including fostering collaboration, communication, and passion.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative",
    "news",
    "management", 
    "team",
    "tips"
  ] 
}
```

I extracted the only clear author name (Jennifer Cobb) and her affiliation from the email address. Since no conference or year was listed, I put "Not Listed" for those fields. The description is a high-level 1-2 sentence summary, and the keywords list includes some salient terms from the content. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON!
