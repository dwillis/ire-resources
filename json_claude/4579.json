 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4579",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Wendy Saltzman",  
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "WPVI-TV ABC Philadelphia"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Hitting the ground running New market, new beat",
  "description": "Tips for investigative reporters starting in a new market or on a new beat.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative reporting",
    "sources", 
    "story ideas",
    "social media",
    "databases"
  ]
}
```

I extracted the one clear author name, email, and affiliation. Since no conference or year is listed, I put "Not Listed" for those fields. The description summarizes the main focus of the text, and the keywords list some of the main topics covered related to investigative reporting.
