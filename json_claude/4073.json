 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": 4073,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "ProPublica"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "Tips and resources for finding and analyzing US Census data.",
  "keywords": [
    "Census",
    "Data",
    "Analysis",
    "Resources",
    "Tips"
  ]
}
```

To summarize the key decisions:

- Set id to 4073
- Left author name null since none listed
- Used ProPublica as affiliation based on context
- Set conference to NICAR based on context
- No year, so set to Not Listed
- No clear title, so left null
- Created 1 sentence summary for description
- Picked 5 relevant keywords

Let me know if you would like me to modify or improve the JSON in any way!
