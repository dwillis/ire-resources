 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "T2323",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Holly Whisenhunt Stephen",  
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "News 4 WOAI TV"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text provides advice and information on analyzing speeding ticket data to uncover trends and debunk myths, as well as examining racial profiling data.",
  "keywords": [
    "speeding tickets",
    "traffic stops", 
    "racial profiling",
    "data analysis",
    "law enforcement"
  ]
}
```

I included the author name, email, and affiliation that was provided. Since no conference, year, or title was clearly identified, I put "Not Listed" for the conference and year keys, and null for the title key. The description is a high-level 1-2 sentence summary, and the keywords list 5 relevant terms related to the content.
