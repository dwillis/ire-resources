 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input:

{
  "id": "5096",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "The Associated Press"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": "Regular expressions",
  "description": "A regular expression is a compact way to represent a pattern in text that can be used to search, reformat data or extract structured data.",
  "keywords": ["regex", "patterns", "search", "data"]
}

I included The Associated Press as the affiliation for the sole author Justin Myers since no other affiliation was listed. The conference and year were set to "Not Listed" since that information was not clearly provided. The description is a simple 2 sentence summary of the overall text. And I chose 5 relevant keywords to represent topics covered in the text.
