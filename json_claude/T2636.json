 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

{
    "id": "T2636",
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": null,
            "email": null,
            "affiliation": "The Star-Ledger"
        }
    ],
    "conference": "Not Listed", 
    "year": "Not Listed",
    "title": "Advanced Internet: Google Tricks, Deep Web, and Resurrecting the Dead",
    "description": "Article provides tips and tricks for using advanced features of Google search such as operators, specialized tools, and Google services.",
    "keywords": [
        "Google", 
        "search tips", 
        "operators", 
        "tools", 
        "services"
    ]
}
