 Here is the JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "5093",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": null},
    {"name": "Kate Howard", "email": null, "affiliation": null},
    {"name": "Matt Kiefer", "email": null, "affiliation": null}, 
    {"name": "Andrew Mollica", "email": null, "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR17", 
  "year": "2017",
  "title": "Putting your town under a microscope -and keeping it there",
  "description": "Tips for investigating and tracking local government issues over time.",
  "keywords": ["investigations", "local government", "census", "budgets"] 
}
```

I made my best attempt to parse the limited information in the text to create a JSON object matching your specifications. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements.
