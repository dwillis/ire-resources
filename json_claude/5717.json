 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5717",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Alex Stuckey", "email": "alexdstuckey@gmail.com", "affiliation": "Houston Chronicle"},
    {"name": "Kenny Jacoby", "email": "kjacoby94@gmail.com", "affiliation": "Scripps Washington Bureau"}, 
    {"name": "Paula Lavigne", "email": "paula.lavigne@espn.com", "affiliation": "ESPN"}
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2018",
  "title": "Sexual Assault on Campus",
  "description": "Investigative journalists share tips on reporting on sexual assault at universities.",
  "keywords": ["sexual assault", "campus", "title ix", "investigations", "universities"]
}
```

I summarized the key details from the text into the appropriate JSON format with the requested keys and values. I included author details where provided, used the organization names as affiliations, summarized the content in the description, identified the conference name and year, and provided relevant keywords.
