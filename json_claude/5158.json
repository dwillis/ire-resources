 Unfortunately there is not enough information in the text to create the full JSON object you described. The text does not contain any author names, emails, affiliations, conference name, year, or keywords. Here is my best attempt at creating a partial JSON object from the information provided:

{
    "id": "5158",
    "authors": [],  
    "conference": "Not Listed",
    "year": "Not Listed",
    "title": "9 Flavors of Police Surveillance Technology",
    "description": "An overview of different types of surveillance technologies used by law enforcement and challenges with them."
}

I've included empty authors and keywords lists since those details were not provided. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional information to add to expand the JSON further.
