 Here is the JSON object for the input:

```json
{
   "id":5870,
   "authors":[
      {
         "name":null,
         "email":null,
         "affiliation":"Global Investigative Journalism Network"
      },
      {
         "name":"Catalina Lobo-Guerrero",
         "email":null,
         "affiliation":null
      },
      {

         "email":null,
         "affiliation":"Columbia Journalism Investigations. Columbia University"  
      },
      {

         "email":null,
         "affiliation":"International Consortium of Investigative Journalists"
      }
   ],
   "conference":"IRE",

   "title":"Cross-border investigations / IRE 2019 Tip Sheet",
   "description":"Tips for doing effective cross-border investigative journalism collaborations.",
   "keywords":[
      "investigations",
      "collaborations",
      "planning",
      "communication"
   ]
}
```

I included the key details from the input like the id, authors, conference, year, and created a title and description to summarize the content. The keywords list highlights some of the main themes. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON structure!
