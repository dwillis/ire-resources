 Unfortunately there is not enough information provided in the text to construct a detailed JSON object. Here is my best attempt based on the guidelines:

```json
{
  "id": 4729,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null  
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "Text does not contain enough information to summarize.",
  "keywords": [] 
}
```

I've left most fields null or empty arrays/lists since there are no names, conference, year, title or clear keywords. The description summarizes that the text does not contain enough details. Please let me know if you have any other example text you would like me to try parsing into a JSON object.
