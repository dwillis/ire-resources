 Here is the JSON object created from the input text:

```json

   "id": "5206",
   "authors":[

         "email":null,

      },
      {

      },
      {
         "name":"Rick Yarborough", 
         "email":null,
         "affiliation":"NBC"
      },
      {
         "name":"Scott Friedman",
         "email":null, 
         "affiliation":"NBC5"
      }
   ],
   "conference":"Not Listed",
   "year":"Not Listed",
   "title":"Broadcast: Deep dive II (Sponsored by National Association of Broadcasters)",
   "description":"The text outlines tips and strategies for investigating vehicle safety issues related to vehicles used for hire such as taxis, Uber and Lyft.",
   "keywords":[
      "investigation",
      "vehicles",
      "safety",
      "Uber",
      "Lyft"
   ]
}
```

I set the conference and year to "Not Listed" since those details were not provided. The description summarizes the key focus of the text. And I picked out a few relevant keywords. The rest of the structure follows the requested format with quotation marks around the keys and values.
