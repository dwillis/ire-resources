 Unfortunately I do not have enough context to confidently create the full JSON object you described. Based on the limited information provided, here is an attempt:

```json
{
  "id": "5294",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": []
}
```

I've included the required keys and structure you specified, but without more context on the actual content I cannot reliably populate the values. Please provide the full text or description that you need converted to JSON, and I'd be happy to assist further. Let me know if you have any other questions!
