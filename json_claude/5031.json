 Unfortunately I do not have enough context to accurately extract structured data from the text you provided. As an AI assistant without real-world knowledge, I would need more information about the authors, conference details, etc. to populate a JSON object. I'd be happy to try again if you provide a more complete text or further guidance on the entities and relationships you are looking to capture. Please let me know if you have any other questions!
