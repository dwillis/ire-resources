 Unfortunately I do not have access to the full text that was provided as input. Based on the instructions, here is an example JSON object I could create:

```json
{
  "id": "5368_1",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "New York Times"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "2018",
  "title": "Data Journalism Workshop",
  "description": "A journalist led a data journalism workshop at the NICAR conference.",
  "keywords": [
    "journalism",
    "data", 
    "workshop",
    "conference",
    "training"
  ]
}
```

I tried to follow the instructions closely in terms of the required keys, value types, sentence summary, number of keywords etc. But without the actual input text I had to make assumptions for the author name/email/affiliation, title, and keywords. Please let me know if you can provide the full input text so I can try generating a more accurate JSON object.
