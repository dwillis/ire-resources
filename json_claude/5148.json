 Unfortunately there is not enough information in the text you provided for me to create a detailed JSON object with all the requested keys. The text does not contain any author names, emails, or affiliations. It also does not mention a specific conference or year. 

Based on the instructions, here is the JSON object I can create from the information provided:

```json
{
  "id": "5148",
  "authors": [], 
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text provides tips for journalists on how to access public data and documents without spending money, including building relationships with gatekeepers, making requests in writing, and understanding disclosure exemptions.",
  "keywords": ["public records", "documents", "data", "access"]
}
```

I included a general 1-2 sentence description summarizing the main topics covered in the text. The conference, year, and author details are listed as "Not Listed" since that information is not provided. Please let me know if you have any other text or context that could allow me to populate additional details for the JSON object.
