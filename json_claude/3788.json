 Here is the JSON object created from the input text:

```json

    {"name": "Jarrett Murphy", "email": null, "affiliation": "City Limits"},

  ],

  "title": "INVESTIGATING POVERTY",
  "description": "The text discusses strategies for investigating and writing about poverty.",

I included the key points from the text - using data and impact to sell stories on poverty to editors and audiences. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON object!
