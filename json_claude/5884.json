 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
  "id": "5884",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "The O'Brien Fellowship in Public Service Journalism",
  "description": "The O'Brien Fellowship selects professional journalists to spend nine months reporting and writing stories that can drive change and improve lives.",
  "keywords": [
    "fellowship", 
    "journalism",
    "reporting",
    "public service"
  ]
}
```

I extracted the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel as an author affiliation since it was mentioned as a potential partner organization. The description summarizes the main purpose of the fellowship, and the keywords capture some of the main themes. The conference and year were listed as "Not Listed" since those details were not clearly provided. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON structure!
