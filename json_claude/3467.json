 Unfortunately I do not have access to the full text you referenced, so I cannot create the exact JSON object you described. However, here is an example JSON object with the requested structure and fictional data:

```json
{
  "id": "3467",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "John Smith",
      "email": "jsmith@example.com", 
      "affiliation": "The Local Gazette"
    },
    {
       "name": null,
       "email": null,
       "affiliation": "ABC News"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2022", 
  "title": "Journalism in the Digital Age",
  "description": "This presentation discussed current trends in digital journalism.",
  "keywords": ["journalism", "digital", "social media", "data"] 
}
```

I included fictional data for the name, email, affiliation, conference, year, title, description, and keywords since I do not have access to the actual text you wanted summarized. But this shows the overall structure you requested with keys and values enclosed in quotations. Let me know if you have any other questions!
