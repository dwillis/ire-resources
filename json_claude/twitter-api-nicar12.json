 Unfortunately, I do not have access to the full text that was provided as input. Based on the information in your instructions, here is an attempt at creating the requested JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "api",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": []
}
```

I've included the requested keys and set most values to null or empty arrays/lists since I don't have the actual content to summarize. Please provide the full input text and I would be happy to generate a more complete JSON object per your specifications. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the output.
