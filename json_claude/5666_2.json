 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5666_2",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Masashi NISHIHATA",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "CITIZEN LAB, University of Toronto"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "DIGITAL THREATS TO NEWSMAKING",
  "description": "A quick tour of the spectrum of information security threats to newsmaking.",
  "keywords": [
    "security threats",
    "journalism", 
    "phishing",
    "surveillance",
    "newsrooms"
  ]
}
```

I summarized the key points from the text for the description, used the one author name provided, left email and affiliation null when not provided, put "Not Listed" for conference and year since those details were not included, and listed 5 relevant keywords from the content. Let me know if you would like me to modify anything!
