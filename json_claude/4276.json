 Unfortunately I do not have enough context to confidently create the JSON object you described from the input provided. If you provide the full text you would like me to parse into the JSON format, I would be happy to try again. Without any input text, the best I can do is provide an example JSON skeleton with the keys and structure you specified:

```json
{
  "id": "4276",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "",
  "description": "", 
  "keywords": [
    "",
    "",
    "",
    "",
    ""
  ]
}
```

Please provide the full input text you would like parsed and I will do my best to create the JSON object with the requested structure.
