 Here is the JSON object for the text:

```json
{
   "id":3421,
   "authors":[
      {
         "name":null,
         "email":null,
         "affiliation":"The Columbus Dispatch"
      },
      {
         "name":"Jill Riepenhoff",
         "email":null,
         "affiliation":"The Columbus Dispatch"  
      },
      {
         "name":"Doug Haddix",
         "email":null,
         "affiliation":"IRE"
      }
   ],
   "conference":"IRE",
   "year":2010,
   "title":"COVERING IMMIGRATION",
   "description":"Tipsheet providing guidance on covering immigration issues and reaching immigrant communities as a journalist.",
   "keywords":[
      "immigration",
      "reporting",
      "communities",
      "sourcing",
      "data"
   ]
}
```

I created the id, authors list, conference, year, title, description, and keywords based on the content of the text. For authors, I included the affiliations listed and put name and email as null when not provided. The description is a short summary, and keywords list some main topics covered without the conference/authors.
