 Here is the JSON object created from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5468_2",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Nick Penzenstadler",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    },
    {
      "name": "Kim Smith",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "urbanlabs.uchicago.edu"
    },
    { 
      "name": "Matt Drange",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Using data and documents to report on guns",
  "description": "Speakers will help you sort out what data and documents you should routinely gather for reporting on guns.",
  "keywords": [
    "guns",
    "data",
    "documents",
    "reporting",
    "tips"
  ]
}
```

I set the conference to "NICAR" based on the tip sheet URL. The year was not clearly identified, so I set it to "Not Listed". The description is a 1-2 sentence summary, and keywords are relevant terms from the text, excluding conference and authors, with a max of 5 terms.
