 Here is a JSON object created from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5571",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",  
  "title": "Enforcing the Right to Know",
  "description": "Strategies for crafting public records requests, dealing with denials and delays, and resources available.",
  "keywords": [
    "public records",
    "FOIA", 
    "investigative reporting",
    "open government",
    "transparency"
  ]
}
```

I included the organization name as the affiliation since no individual author name was provided. The description summarizes the main topics covered. And I selected 5 relevant keywords related to the subject matter.
