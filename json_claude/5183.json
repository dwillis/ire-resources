 Unfortunately there is no input text provided to create the JSON object from. To demonstrate my ability to create such an object, here is an example with made up data:

```json
{
  "id": "5183",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "John Smith",
      "email": "jsmith@email.com",
      "affiliation": "The Local News"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2022",
  "title": "An analysis of crime data",
  "description": "The article analyzes trends in crime data over the past decade.",
  "keywords": ["crime", "data", "analysis", "trends", "statistics"]
}
```

I can update this example JSON if an input text is provided to extract the necessary information from. Please let me know if you would like me to try creating the JSON from a specific text.
