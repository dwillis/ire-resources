 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
  "id": "5424",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Ronald Campbell",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "NBC Owned Television Stations"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "2018",
  "title": "After FactFinder: Navigating data.census.gov",
  "description": "The article discusses and evaluates the new data exploration tool data.census.gov that is scheduled to replace the existing FactFinder tool used for accessing U.S. Census data.",
  "keywords": ["census", "data", "search", "tables", "FactFinder"]
}
```

I extracted the author name, email, and affiliation from the text. The conference, year, and title were also pulled directly. I created a 1-2 sentence summary for the description, and listed 5 relevant keywords not including the conference or authors. The id is set to 5424 as requested. All keys and values are enclosed in double quotes.
