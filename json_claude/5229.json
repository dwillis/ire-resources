 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
  "id": "5229",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "David Milstead",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Rocky Mountain News"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": "ETHICS WAIVER JUST PART OF RED ROBIN'S 'UNBRIDLED CULTURE'",
  "description": "Red Robin Gourmet Burgers tells website visitors that the company's core values create an unbridled culture that sometimes leads to extraordinary things.",
  "keywords": [
    "Red Robin",
    "ethics", 
    "culture",
    "values",
    "burgers"
  ]
}
```

I included the news organization the author writes for as their affiliation, made up a short 1-2 sentence summary for the description, and listed 5 relevant keywords from the content. The conference and year were marked as "Not Listed" since that information was not provided.
