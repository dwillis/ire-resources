 Unfortunately I do not have enough context to fully create the JSON object you described. The input text does not contain clear author names, email addresses, affiliations, conference names, years, descriptions, or keywords. Without more information, I cannot accurately populate those fields. I can provide a sample JSON structure with placeholder values:

```json
{
  "id": "3603",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": [
    "keyword1",
    "keyword2",
    "keyword3",
    "keyword4", 
    "keyword5"
  ]
}
```

Please provide the full input text you would like me to parse, and I would be happy to create the JSON object with actual values populated. Without source text, I cannot confidently fill in the details you specified. Let me know if you have any other questions!
