 Here is the JSON object for the text:

```json
{
  "id": "3465",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Anthony DeBarros","email": null,"affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": "Free software, part deux",
  "description": "The text discusses various free software options for tasks like virtualization, statistics, GIS and web development.",
  "keywords": ["software","virtualization","statistics","GIS","web"]
}
```

I included Anthony DeBarros as the only listed author, left email and affiliation as null since those were not provided, used "NICAR" as the conference since that was referenced, left year as "Not Listed" since a specific year was not given, created a short description summarizing the main topics, and listed 5 relevant keywords.
