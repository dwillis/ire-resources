 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5205",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Amanda Chicago Lewis", 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Rolling Stone"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": null,
  "description": "Amanda Chicago Lewis is a Rolling Stone columnist who has covered the cannabis industry for four years. She focuses on issues like public safety, special interests, and racial disparities in the legal cannabis industry.",
  "keywords": [
    "cannabis", 
    "industry",
    "public safety",
    "special interests",
    "racial disparities"
  ] 
}
```

I extracted the only author name listed, set the email and affiliation to null or the news organization name. The conference, year, and title were not listed, so I set those values accordingly. The description is a 1-2 sentence summary, and the keywords list 5 relevant terms excluding the conference and authors.
