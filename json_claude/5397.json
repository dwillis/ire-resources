 Here is the JSON object:

  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Digital Security Tip Sheet for Journalists",
  "description": "Tip sheet with advice on digital security for journalists including password management, encryption, secure communication tools.",
  "keywords": ["security", "privacy", "journalism", "tips"] 
}
```

I set the conference to "NICAR" since that acronym is mentioned. The year was not listed, so I set that to "Not Listed". For the description, I summarized the main topics covered in the text. And for keywords I picked out a few relevant terms related to the content.
