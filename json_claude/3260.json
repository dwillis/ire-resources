 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
  "id": "3260",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "TEN THINGS TO LOOK FOR NEXT MONTH",
  "description": "The text lists important dates and types of information to look for in upcoming midyear campaign finance and lobbying disclosure filings.",
  "keywords": [
    "campaign finance",
    "lobbying",
    "disclosure",
    "filings",
    "fundraising",
    "spending",
    "PACs",
    "issues",
    "revolving door"
  ] 
}
```

I summarized the main points into a description, extracted a list of keywords, and left the author information blank since no authors were listed. The conference and year were also left as "Not Listed" since those details were not provided.
