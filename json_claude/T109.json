 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
    "id": "T109",
    "authors": [
        {"name": "Aida Bustos", "email": null, "affiliation": "The San Diego Union-Tribune"},
        {"name": "Gregory Gross", "email": null, "affiliation": "The San Diego Union-Tribune"},
        {"name": "Fernando Romero", "email": null, "affiliation": "The San Diego Union-Tribune"}
    ],
    "conference": "Not Listed", 
    "year": "Not Listed",
    "title": null,
    "description": "A guide for journalists covering news stories across the U.S.-Mexico border that provides background, context and practical advice.",
    "keywords": ["Border", "Journalism", "Mexico", "Reporting", "Tijuana"]
}
```

I made the id "T109" and left the title as null since no title is provided. The conference and year are "Not Listed" since no conference is mentioned. The description summarizes the overall purpose and content of the text. The keywords list salient topics excluding the conference and authors.
