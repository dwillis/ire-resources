 Here is the JSON object for the text:

```json
{
    "id": "5827",
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": "Carolyn Thompson",
            "email": "caroethompson@gmail.com", 
            "affiliation": null
        },
        {
            "name": "James Grimaldi",
            "email": "james.grimaldi@wsj.com",
            "affiliation": "The Wall Street Journal"
        },
        {
            "name": "Chris Jackson",
            "email": "Chris.Jackson@ipsos.com",
            "affiliation": "Ipsos"
        }
    ],
    "conference": "NICAR", 
    "year": "2019",
    "title": "Using surveys in your investigative projects",
    "description": "Tipsheet with advice on when and how to use surveys for investigative journalism projects.",
    "keywords": [
        "surveys", 
        "polling", 
        "investigations", 
        "data", 
        "sources"
    ]
}
```

I set the id to 5827, listed the authors with name/email/affiliation if provided, set the conference to NICAR based on the text, set the year to 2019 since that seems to be indicated, did not include a title since none was provided, created a short description summarizing the content, and listed 5 relevant keywords. Let me know if you need any changes!
