  "description": "Tips and ideas for consumer investigations and quick turnaround watchdog stories during the economic downturn.",
  "keywords": ["consumers", "investigations", "economy", "scams", "tips"]
}
```

I summarized the main topic, created a unique ID, listed the author names and affiliations, identified the conference as IRE based on the text, used the year 2009 from the document, kept the existing title, and listed five relevant keywords. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
