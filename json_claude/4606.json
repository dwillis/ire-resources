 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
    "id": "4606",
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": null, 
            "email": null, 
            "affiliation": "9NEWS"
        }
    ],
    "conference": "Not Listed",
    "year": "Not Listed", 
    "title": null,
    "description": "Tips for conducting interviews for news stories, including how to approach different types of subjects, prepare questions, and follow up after the interview.",
    "keywords": ["interviews", "news", "reporting", "preparation", "questions"]
}
```

I made the following assumptions:

- There were no clear author names, emails or affiliations listed, so I put null values and used "9NEWS" as the affiliation based on it being a news organization mentioned
- There was no conference or year listed related to the text
- There was no clear title, so I left that null
- I created a 1-2 sentence summary for the description 
- I picked 5 relevant keywords excluding conference and authors

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON!
