 Unfortunately I do not have access to the full text you described, so I cannot generate the exact JSON object you requested. However, here is an example JSON object with made up data that matches the structure you specified:

```json
{
  "id": "4383",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "John Smith",
      "email": "jsmith@newsorg.com",
      "affiliation": "The Daily Times"
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Freelance"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "2016",
  "title": "Data-driven reporting on local government spending",
  "description": "This session examined methods for analyzing city budget data to uncover spending trends.",
  "keywords": ["government", "budgets", "spending", "data analysis"]
}
```

The key things this example includes:

- The id is set to 4383
- authors array with name, email, and affiliation for two authors 
- conference is "NICAR"
- Made up year, title, description, and keywords

Let me know if you have any other questions!
