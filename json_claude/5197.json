 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5197",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "CBS 5 Phoenix" 
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "Tips and advice for journalists reporting on immigration and border issues, emphasizing the importance of humanizing statistics, exposing hidden stories, and avoiding misconceptions.",
  "keywords": [
    "border reporting",
    "storytelling", 
    "immigration",
    "impact",
    "misconceptions"
  ]
}
```

I made the description a broad 1-2 sentence summary of the main points. The conference, year, and title were not clearly identified, so I put "Not Listed" or null. For the author, the only affiliation listed was CBS 5 Phoenix, so I used that as the affiliation with name and email as null. The keywords are a selection of topics covered without the conference name or author info.
