 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "3773",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Daniel Connolly", "email": null, "affiliation": "The Commercial Appeal"}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": "Finding the holes in economic impact studies",
  "description": "The article discusses questions journalists should ask when reviewing economic impact studies, using a factory subsidy deal in Memphis as an example.",
  "keywords": ["economic impact", "studies", "subsidies", "factories", "jobs"]
}
```

I included the author name and affiliation from The Commercial Appeal newspaper. The conference, year, and email were not listed, so I put placeholder values. The description summarizes the key points, and the keywords capture some of the main topics. Let me know if you need any changes to this JSON structure.
