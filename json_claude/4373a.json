 Unfortunately I do not have access to the full text that was provided as input. Based on the information in your instructions, here is an attempt at creating the requested JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "4373a",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": []
}
```

I have included the requested keys and structure, but without the full text I am unable to populate the values for title, description, keywords, author names/details, conference, or year. Please provide the full text input and I would be happy to generate the JSON object from that. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
