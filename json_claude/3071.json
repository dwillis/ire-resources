 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "3071",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "Narco News"},
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Online Investigative Reporting Tip Sheet",
  "description": "Tip sheet providing advice on conducting online investigative journalism, including obtaining documents, working with whistleblowers and informants, and dealing with intimidation.",
  "keywords": ["investigative journalism", "documents", "whistleblowers", "informants", "intimidation"]
}
```

I left the author names as null since none were listed, used "Narco News" as an affiliation for the first author based on context clues, did not see a specific conference year so put "Not Listed", and summarized the content into a short description. The keywords cover some of the main topics without going over 5 terms. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON!
