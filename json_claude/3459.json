 Here is the JSON object created from the input:

```json

      },
      {
         "name":"Michael Bernstein",
         "email":null,

      },
      {

      },
      {
         "name":"Sam Madden",
         "email":null,

      },   
      {

         "email":null, 
         "affiliation":null
      }
   ],
   "conference":"NICAR",
   "year":"Not Listed",
   "title":"Tweets telling stories; Tweets as data",
   "description":"The presentation discusses using Twitter data to tell stories and extract structured data using tools like TwitInfo and TweeQL.",
   "keywords":[
      "Twitter",
      "data",
      "stories",
      "TwitInfo", 
      "TweeQL"
   ]
}
```

I set the conference to "NICAR" since this tip sheet is from Investigative Reporters and Editors. The year was not clearly listed, so I set it to "Not Listed". The description summarizes the main points, and the keywords list some relevant terms related to the content.
