 Here is the JSON object generated from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5020",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Jennifer Forsyth", "email": "jennifer.forsyth@wsj.com", "affiliation": "The Wall Street Journal"},
    {"name": "Holly Hacker", "email": "hhacker@dallasnews.com", "affiliation": "The Dallas Morning News"},  
    {"name": "Andrea Fuller", "email": "andrea.fuller@wsj.com", "affiliation": "The Wall Street Journal"}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "",
  "description": "The article discusses the College Scorecard database, its payoffs and pitfalls, and examples of stories generated from it.",
  "keywords": ["College Scorecard", "data", "higher education", "loans", "earnings"]  
}
```

I extracted the author names, emails, and affiliations from the input text. Since no conference name or year was provided, I put "Not Listed" for those fields. The description summarizes the key points in simple language. For keywords, I chose 5 terms related to the content that weren't conference/author names.
