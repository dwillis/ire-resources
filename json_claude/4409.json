 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4409",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Topher Sanders",
      "email": "Topher.sanders@jacksonville.com",
      "affiliation": "The Florida Times-Union"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR 2015 Atlanta", 
  "year": 2015,
  "title": "Policing the Police",
  "description": "Provides investigative reporters tips on obtaining data and sourcing stories to provide oversight of police departments and district attorney offices.",
  "keywords": [
    "policing",
    "investigative reporting",
    "data sources",
    "public records"
  ] 
}
```

I extracted the one author name that was listed along with his email and affiliation. The conference name and year were clearly identified in the text. The title was the bold heading at the top. The description summarizes the overall content. And I chose 5 relevant keywords to characterize the subject matter.
