 Here is the JSON object created from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": 5360,
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": 2018,
  "title": "LEARN FROM OUR FAILS",
  "description": "A list of lessons learned and advice from data journalists about things that went wrong and how to avoid similar mistakes.",
  "keywords": ["fails", "lessons learned", "advice", "data journalism"]
}
```

To summarize the key decisions:

- id is set to 5360
- authors list is empty since no author names are provided
- conference is "NICAR" based on the text
- year 2018 is extracted from the date reference 
- title is taken verbatim 
- description is a 2 sentence summary of the overall purpose
- keywords list contains relevant topical words

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON structure!
