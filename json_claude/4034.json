 Unfortunately I do not have access to the input text that you described in order to generate the requested JSON object. If you could provide the text or clarify the source of the input, I would be happy to attempt creating the JSON object with the specified keys and values. Without any input text I am unable to populate fields like the author names, email addresses, affiliations, conference, year, title, description and keywords. Please let me know if you can provide those details or point me to the text you would like me to parse. I'm happy to take another attempt at this once I have the necessary input.
