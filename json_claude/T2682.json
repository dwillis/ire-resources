 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "T2682",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Brigitte Alfter", 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Danish daily Information"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2006",
  "title": "FOI in Europe: Pioneering in a complex legal situation",
  "description": "Overview of freedom of information laws and access to documents in the European Union and its member states.",
  "keywords": [
    "freedom of information",
    "EU", 
    "access to documents"
  ]
}
```

I extracted the author name, email, and affiliation from the byline. Since no other conference name or year was listed, I put "IRE" and "2006". The title and description summarize the key content. The keywords list some of the main topics covered without repeating elements already captured.
