 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the text:

```json
{
  "id": "5814",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Margot Williams", "email": null, "affiliation": "The Intercept"},
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "2019",
  "title": "Research on the Beach at NICAR 2019",
  "description": "Tips and resources for investigative journalists to aid research and finding public records.",
  "keywords": ["research", "tips", "resources", "investigative journalism", "public records"]  
}
```

I set the conference to "NICAR" and year to "2019" based on it being mentioned in the title. The description is my own 1-2 sentence summary. I included 5 keywords related to the overall topics covered in the text. The one author I could identify is Margot Williams with The Intercept, the rest I left as null values.
