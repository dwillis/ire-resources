 Unfortunately there is no input text provided to create the requested JSON object from. To create such an object, I would need some textual content that I could analyze and extract the necessary information like author names, email addresses, conference name, year, title, description, and keywords. Without any input text, I do not have enough information to generate the JSON object with the specified keys and attributes. Please provide the relevant input text, and I would be happy to parse it and create the requested JSON output. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional details to provide.
