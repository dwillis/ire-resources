 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the text:

{
    "id": "3440",
    "authors": [
        {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "San Diego State University"}
    ],
    "conference": "Not Listed", 
    "year": "Not Listed",
    "title": "Quick shortcut for using PDFTOTEXT",
    "description": "Instructions for creating a shortcut to easily convert PDF files to text files using the PDFTOTEXT program.",
    "keywords": ["PDF", "text", "conversion", "shortcut", "XPDF"]
}

I included the institution name as the affiliation since no individual author name was provided. The conference, year, and title were not clearly stated so I put "Not Listed" and created a literal title. The description is a 1-2 sentence summary, and I included 5 relevant keywords. Let me know if you would like me to modify anything!
