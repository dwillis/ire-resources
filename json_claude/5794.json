 Unfortunately I do not have enough context to confidently create the requested JSON object from the input text. The instructions mention parsing details about a conference, authors, year, etc. but none of that information seems to be clearly contained in the text provided. Without more context or representative sample inputs, I cannot reliably carry out the specific data extraction and transformation steps outlined. Please provide a more relevant text input, or clarify the expected JSON format with examples based on this text. I'm happy to try again but need additional detail to complete this task accurately.
