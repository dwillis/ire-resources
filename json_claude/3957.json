 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

      {

         "email": null,

      },
      {

      },
      {
         "name": "Tom Williams",

         "affiliation": null
      }
   ],
   "conference": "IRE",
   "year": "2013",
   "title": "The Nuts and Bolts of Open Records Battles",
   "description": "Tipsheet with advice for journalists on strategies for obtaining public records through open records requests and battles.",
   "keywords": [
      "public records",
      "open records", 
      "FOIA", 
      "tips",
      "strategies"
   ]
}
```

I included the 4 author names listed, left email and affiliation null since none were provided. The conference is "IRE" based on it being the "2013 IRE Presentation". The year is 2013 from the same mention. The title and description summarize the content. And I chose 5 relevant keywords about the topic and content.
