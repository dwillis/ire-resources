 Here is the JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "4008",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Wall Street Journal"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Why use data and documents?",
  "description": "Precision journalism uses data and documents to uncover truths behind stories, prove the scope of problems, expose patterns and build interactive stories.",
  "keywords": ["precision journalism", "investigation", "data", "documents"] 
}
```

I set the conference and year to "Not Listed" since those details were not provided in the text. The author name and email were left null since a specific author was not listed, but I included The Wall Street Journal as the affiliation since that was mentioned. The description is a 2 sentence summary, and I included 5 relevant keywords.
