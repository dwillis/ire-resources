 Unfortunately there is not enough context in the prompt to extract all of the requested information. Based on the details provided, here is a partial JSON object:

{
  "id": "5035",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": []
}

I've included the requested keys and set most values to "Not Listed" or null, since no additional text was provided to extract the necessary details from. If more context or source text is provided in a follow-up prompt, I would be happy to attempt extracting the full set of requested information. Please let me know if any clarification would be helpful!
