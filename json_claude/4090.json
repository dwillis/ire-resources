 Unfortunately I do not have the full text to analyze and extract the requested information. From the instructions provided, here is an example JSON object with dummy data that matches the requested structure:

```json
{
  "id": "4090",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "John Smith",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Daily News"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "2022",
  "title": "Investigating Campaign Finance Violations",
  "description": "This research analyzed campaign finance reports to uncover violations.",
  "keywords": [
    "campaign finance",
    "investigations",
    "politics"
  ]
}
```

To create an accurate JSON object, I would need the full text. Please provide the content you would like analyzed and I can attempt to extract the requested information to populate the JSON structure. Without any text, I can only provide an example of how the JSON should be structured.
