 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5297",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Sarah Hutchins", "email": null, "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "IRE & NICAR", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Web searches & social media for journalists",
  "description": "Tips and tricks for using search engines and social media to research stories.",
  "keywords": ["search engines", "social media", "reporting", "journalism", "research"]
}
```

I included Sarah Hutchins as the only author since no other names were listed. I put the conference as both IRE & NICAR since it was formatted that way in the text. The year was not clearly identified, so I put "Not Listed". The description is a 1-2 sentence summary, and the keywords are relevant terms from the content excluding the conference and authors.
