 Unfortunately there is not enough information provided in the text to construct a comprehensive JSON object based on the criteria you specified. The text does not contain clear author names, conference names, years, or descriptions that could be used to populate those JSON fields. The best I can do is provide a partial JSON object as follows:

```json
{
  "id": "4467",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": []
}
```

Please provide more detailed source text containing the necessary information, and I will try again to construct the requested JSON object.
