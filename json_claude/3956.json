 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "3956",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "The Wall Street Journal"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": "Pharmacies Fought Controls",
  "description": "The article discusses how compounding pharmacies fought off attempts to increase federal regulation over them prior to a meningitis outbreak in 2012.",
  "keywords": [
    "pharmacies",
    "regulation", 
    "meningitis",
    "outbreak",
    "oversight"
  ]
}
```

I left the author name and email as null since none were provided. I used The Wall Street Journal as the affiliation since the article appears to come from The Wall Street Journal based on the reference to the authors. The conference, year, and title were not clearly identified, so I put "Not Listed". The description is a 1-2 sentence summary of the key points. The keywords list some relevant terms related to the article content.
