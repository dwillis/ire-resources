 Unfortunately there is not enough information provided in the text to fully construct the requested JSON object. Here is my attempt based on the information available:

```json
{
  "id": "5744",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "No description available",
  "keywords": []
}
```

I've included the requested id and structure for authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords, but most values had to be set to "Not Listed" or null since no detailed information was provided in the question text. Let me know if you have any other sample text you'd like me to try constructing JSON for! I'm happy to give it another try with more input data.
