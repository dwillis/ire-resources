 Here is the JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "5365",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Mizell Stewart III", "email": null, "affiliation": null},
    {"name": "Yolanda Martinez", "email": null, "affiliation": null},  
    {"name": "Tracie Powell", "email": null, "affiliation": null},
    {"name": "Mark J. Rochester", "email": null, "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2018",
  "title": "10 steps to achieve greater diversity among investigative journalists",
  "description": "The authors provide 10 steps news organizations can take to increase diversity on investigative reporting teams.",
  "keywords": ["diversity", "investigative reporting", "journalism", "recruiting", "training"]  
}
```

I included the key information from the text in the JSON object, including the authors, conference name and year, title, a short description, and relevant keywords. The id is set to 5365 and the authors list contains names but no contact info. Let me know if you need any changes to this JSON structure.
