 Unfortunately I do not have access to the original text to summarize and extract keywords. Based on the information provided, here is an example JSON object with fictional data:

{
  "id": "4697",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "John Smith",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Local Times"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "2022",
  "title": "Data Journalism Techniques",
  "description": "The presentation covered techniques for analyzing data to uncover stories.",
  "keywords": [
    "data",
    "analysis", 
    "investigation",
    "statistics",
    "trends"
  ]
}

I would need more context from the original text to accurately populate all of the requested fields. Please provide the full text or clarify any missing information in order to generate an accurate JSON summary.
