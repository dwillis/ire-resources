 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "4663",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Washington Post"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": "When and How Data Journalists Disclose their Methods",
  "description": "A panel discussion on whether data journalists should disclose their data analysis methods, and examples of when some news organizations do and do not.",
  "keywords": [
    "transparency", 
    "methodology",
    "data analysis",
    "journalism",
    "panel discussion"
  ]
}
```

I included the Washington Post as an affiliation since Aaron Williams was listed as being from the Washington Post. The description is a brief 2 sentence summary of the main topic. And I included 5 relevant keywords related to the discussion. Let me know if you would like me to modify anything!
