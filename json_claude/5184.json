 Unfortunately there is no input text provided to create the requested JSON object from. To demonstrate my capabilities, here is an example JSON object I could create given some sample input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5184",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "John Smith", 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Local Gazette"
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2023",
  "title": "Investigating City Hall",
  "description": "An investigative report alleging corruption in the city's zoning department.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative reporting",
    "local government", 
    "corruption"
  ]
}
```

I can extract key details from text to populate a JSON structure with the requested keys and nested attributes. Please provide an input text sample and I would be happy to create a JSON object from it.
