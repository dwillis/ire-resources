 Here is the JSON object for the text:

```json
{
   "id": "4797",
   "authors":[
      {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "The Investigative Fund"},
      {"name": "Lee Fang", "email": null, "affiliation": "The Intercept"},
      {"name": "Seth Wessler", "email": null, "affiliation": null}
   ],
   "conference":"IRE",
   "year":"2016",
   "title":"Obtaining & Analyzing Documents â€” for Freelancers & Tiny Newsrooms",
   "description":"Tips for freelancers and small newsrooms on getting access to key documents and managing the data entry process.",
   "keywords":[
      "documents",
      "FOIA", 
      "legal help", 
      "data entry",
      "investigative journalism"
   ]
}
```

I set the conference to "IRE" since it mentions the "IRE 2016" event. The year is set to 2016 based on that as well. For the description, I summarized the main topics covered in the text. The keywords list some of the main themes. Let me know if you need me to modify anything!
