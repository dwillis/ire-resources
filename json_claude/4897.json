 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

{
  "id": "4897",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Online resources for journalists",
  "description": "A list of online search tools and resources that can be helpful for journalists' investigations.",
  "keywords": [
    "resources",
    "search",
    "investigation",
    "journalism",
    "tools"
  ]
}

I included a placeholder author object since no author names were provided. The conference and year are listed as "Not Listed" since those details were not clearly identified. The description summarizes the main content, and the keywords list several relevant terms related to the resources mentioned, excluding the conference and authors. Please let me know if you would like me to modify anything!
