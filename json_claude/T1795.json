 Unfortunately I do not have the original text to summarize. Based on the instructions provided, here is an example JSON object I could create:

```json
{
  "id": "T1795",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null  
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "A 1-2 sentence summary would go here if I had the original text.",
  "keywords": [
    "keyword1",
    "keyword2",
    "keyword3",
    "keyword4",
    "keyword5"
  ] 
}
```

The key things to note:

- id is set to T1795
- authors is an array, with name/email/affiliation objects inside 
- conference defaults to Not Listed
- year defaults to Not Listed
- description is a short 1-2 sentence summary
- keywords contains up to 5 keywords

Let me know if you have the original text to summarize and I can update the JSON appropriately.
