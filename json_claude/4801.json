 Here is the JSON object generated from the input text:

{
  "id": "4801",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Rick Yarborough", "email": null, "affiliation": "WRC-TV"},
    {"name": "Jodie Fleischer", "email": null, "affiliation": "WSB-TV"}, 
    {"name": "Chris Nakamoto", "email": null, "affiliation": "WBRZ-TV"}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": "When Things Change Dramatically",
  "description": "The panel discusses how journalists deal with unexpected developments in investigations before they air.",
  "keywords": ["investigations", "developments", "legal", "ethical", "handcuffs"]  
}
```

I summarized the key points about the panel into a 1-2 sentence description, and extracted 5 keywords excluding the conference name and author names/affiliations. The year is listed as "Not Listed" since a specific year is not identified. The conference is NICAR based on the contextual clues.
