 Unfortunately I do not have access to the input text that would be required to create the requested JSON object. As an AI assistant without access to additional context, I am unable to fabricate realistic author names, conference details, summaries, or keywords. However, I can provide an example of the expected format with placeholder values:

```json
{
  "id": "5822",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "A brief factual summary of the content.",
  "keywords": [
    "keyword1",
    "keyword2",
    "keyword3",  
    "keyword4",
    "keyword5"
  ] 
}
```

Please provide the original input text and I would be happy to attempt creating the requested JSON object to the best of my abilities. Let me know if you have any other questions!
