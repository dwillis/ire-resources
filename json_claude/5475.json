 Unfortunately there is not enough context in the prompt to generate a complete JSON object. The prompt refers to "the input" and "the text", but does not include the actual input text. Without that, I do not have the necessary information about authors, conference, year, title, description, or keywords to populate those fields. 

However, here is an example JSON object with some of the requested structure and null values for the fields that require input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5475",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": null, 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": [
    null,
    null,
    null,
    null,
    null
  ]
}
```

Please provide the full input text you would like converted to JSON so I can extract the necessary details to populate the object fields. I'm happy to assist further once I have that additional context.
