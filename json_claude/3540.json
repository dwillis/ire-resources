 Here is the JSON object:

```json
{
    "id": 3540,
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": "Thomas Hargrove",
            "email": null, 
            "affiliation": "Scripps Howard News Service"
        }
    ],
    "conference": "Not Listed", 
    "year": "Not Listed",
    "title": null,
    "description": "The text provides advice on how to identify unsolved serial killings in local communities using FBI databases.",
    "keywords": [
        "murder",
        "homicide",
        "serial killer",
        "FBI",
        "police"
    ]
}
```

I set the title to null since there was no clear title in the text. The description summarizes the main purpose of the text. The conference and year are "Not Listed" since those details were not provided. The keywords list contains relevant topics mentioned in the text. The id is set to 3540 as requested. The one clear author is included with their affiliation based on the news organization mentioned.
