 Unfortunately there is not enough information in the text provided to create a structured JSON object with the required fields. There are no clear author names or affiliations, conference name, year or title.

To assist further, here is an example of the expected JSON format with some fictional data:

```json
{
  "id": "5902",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "John Smith",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Local Paper"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "2022",
  "title": "Investigating Toxic Schools",
  "description": "A journalist describes methods for scientifically testing for hazards in schools without making the story read like a lab report.",
  "keywords": ["schools", "testing", "hazards", "investigation"] 
}
```

Please provide more structured source text with the necessary fields to extract into the defined JSON format. I'd be happy to try again with more complete information.
