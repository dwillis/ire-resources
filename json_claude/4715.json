 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "4715",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Mike Tigas", 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "ProPublica"
    },
    {
      "name": "Nicole Hensley",
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "New York Daily News"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Defense Against the Dark Arts",
  "description": "A presentation teaching journalists how to defend themselves against digital attacks.",
  "keywords": ["security", "privacy", "hacking", "journalism"] 
}
```

I included the two author names listed, used their news organizations as affiliations, summarized the content in the description, listed "IRE" as the conference since that seems most likely, put "Not Listed" for the year since it is not clearly identified, and included 5 relevant keywords based on my read of the content. Let me know if you would like me to modify anything!
