 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
  "id": "5899",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigating Tech Companies in Silicon Valley and Beyond",
  "description": "The text provides tips for journalists on investigating tech companies, including finding sources, conceiving story ideas, and using tools like government records and databases.",
  "keywords": ["reporting process", "story conception", "tools to use", "sources"] 
}
```

I left the authors array empty since no author names were provided. The conference and year are listed as "Not Listed" since those details were not clearly identified. The description is a short 1-2 sentence summary of the key aspects covered in the text. And the keywords list includes some top-level topics covered without going over 5 terms.
