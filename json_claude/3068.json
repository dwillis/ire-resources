 Unfortunately I do not have access to the full text that was provided as input. Based on the instructions, here is an example JSON object I could create:

```json
{
  "id": "3068",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "New York Times"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "",
  "description": "A 1-2 sentence summary would go here",
  "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2"] 
}
```

I would need the full text input to accurately populate the authors, affiliation, conference, year, title, description, and keywords fields. Please provide the full text input if you would like me to generate the JSON object.
