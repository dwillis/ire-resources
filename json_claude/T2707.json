 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
    "id": "T2707",
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": "Jaimi Dowdell",  
            "email": "jdowdell@post-dispatch.com",
            "affiliation": "St. Louis Post-Dispatch"
        },
        {
            "name": "Aaron Kessler",
            "email": "akessler@dailyprogress.com",
            "affiliation": "The (Charlottesville, Va.) Daily Progress"
        }
    ],
    "conference": "IRE",
    "year": "2006",
    "title": "Latest in social network analysis",
    "description": "Social network analysis is a research method to analyze relationships between people and organizations by mapping connections.",
    "keywords": [
        "social network analysis", 
        "relationships", 
        "mapping", 
        "graphics", 
        "power structure"
    ]
}
```

I extracted the conference name, year, author names, emails, and affiliations from the text. The description summarizes the main points, and the keywords list some of the key terms related to social network analysis. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON!
