 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": 4706,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null, 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Associated Press"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "The Bot Emporium",
  "description": "A selection of parts, platforms, applications and ideas for your newsroom.",
  "keywords": [
    "automation",
    "bots",
    "tools",
    "applications",
    "platforms"
  ]
}
```

To summarize the key steps:

- Set id to 4706
- authors contains one element with affiliation as "Associated Press" since that is a news organization mentioned, but name and email are null
- conference is "NICAR" based on context 
- year is "Not Listed" since no year given
- title and description are summaries of the content
- keywords list 5 relevant terms

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON!
