 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4184_1",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "The Wall Street Journal"},
    {"name": "Eric Eyre", "email": null, "affiliation": "Charleston (W. VA.) Gazette"},
    {"name": "Liam Dillon", "email": null, "affiliation": "Voice of San Diego"}, 
    {"name": "Kate Martin", "email": null, "affiliation": "The News Tribune"}
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Small newsrooms, big stories: Doing investigations with limited resources",
  "description": "The panel discusses strategies for pursuing investigative stories and acquiring records with limited resources at small news organizations.",
  "keywords": ["investigations", "records", "resources", "newsrooms", "strategies"]
}
```

I extracted the conference name, author names and affiliations, and created a short description and list of keywords. Since a year was not clearly listed, I put "Not Listed" for the year key. The id and overall structure follows the requested format. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON.
