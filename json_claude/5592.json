 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5592",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "John Hill", "email": null, "affiliation": "Honolulu Civil Beat"}
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": "Cultivating an Investigative Attitude",
  "description": "Tips and advice for investigative journalists on finding stories, assessing sources, using data, interviewing subjects, and writing stories.",
  "keywords": ["investigations", "journalism", "sources", "data", "interviews", "writing"]
}
```

I made John Hill the sole author since no other authors were listed. I put his affiliation as Honolulu Civil Beat since that seems to be the organization he is affiliated with based on the byline. The conference is IRE based on the subreddit this was posted in. No year was listed so I put "Not Listed". The description is my own 1-2 sentence summary, and the keywords are what I judged to be the most relevant terms from the content.
