 Unfortunately there is not enough context in the input you provided to create the requested JSON object. To generate a JSON object with the specified keys and nested attributes, I would need some sample text or other content to extract the necessary information from. Please provide a paragraph, article excerpt, or other textual content that I can analyze to identify details like author names, affiliation, conference names, etc. With relevant input text I'd be happy to create the JSON object you described. Let me know if you can provide a content sample that I can process.
