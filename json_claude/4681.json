 Here is a suggested JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
  "id": 4681,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Associated Press"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "AP Exclusive: DEA agent accused of conspiring with cartel",
  "description": "A once-standout DEA agent is accused of conspiring with a Mexican drug cartel to leak information to them in exchange for cash, gifts and prostitutes.",
  "keywords": ["DEA", "drug cartel", "Mexico", "bribery"] 
}
```

I included "The Associated Press" as the author affiliation since the text mentions it is an AP Exclusive article. The conference, year and some author details are listed as "Not Listed" or null since that information does not appear in the provided text. The description is a 2 sentence summary, and keywords list 5 relevant terms from the article text.
