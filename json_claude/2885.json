 Here is the JSON object:

```json
{
    "id": "2885",
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": "Duff Wilson",
            "email": "dwilson@nytimes.com",
            "affiliation": "The New York Times"
        }
    ],
    "conference": "IRE",
    "year": "2006", 
    "title": "Getting the Most Out of the Internet",
    "description": "Tips and useful websites for investigative journalists and reporters to find background information on people and stories.",
    "keywords": [
        "research", 
        "reporting", 
        "investigation", 
        "internet", 
        "tips"
    ]
}
```

I included the key details from the text - the ID, author name and affiliation, conference name and year, a brief title and description, and a few relevant keywords. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON.
