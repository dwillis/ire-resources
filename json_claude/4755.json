 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4755",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Peggy Lowe", "email": null, "affiliation": "Harvest Public Media"},
    {"name": "Nils Mulvad", "email": null, "affiliation": "Kaas & Mulvad"}, 
    {"name": "Pam Dempsey", "email": null, "affiliation": "The Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting"}
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigating Agribusiness",
  "description": "The data and stories behind the untapped field of our food and fuel.",
  "keywords": ["agribusiness", "investigations", "data", "food", "fuel"]  
}
```

I parsed the author names and affiliations where available. Since no year or conference is clearly identified, I put "Not Listed" for those values. The description is a 2 sentence summary, and I chose 5 relevant keywords based on topics mentioned in the text.
