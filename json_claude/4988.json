 Here is the JSON object:

```json
{
    "id": 4988,
    "authors": [
        {"name": "Lynda Cohen", "email": null, "affiliation": "BreakingAC.com"}
    ],
    "conference": "Not Listed",
    "year": "Not Listed",
    "title": "Using social media and internet in reporting",
    "description": "The article discusses how to use social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube to find stories, sources, and build an audience.",
    "keywords": ["social media", "reporting", "stories", "sources", "audience"] 
}
```

I included the key points from the article in the description, used the author's name and website affiliation, and selected a few relevant keywords. The conference and year were set to "Not Listed" since that information was not provided. Let me know if you need any changes!
