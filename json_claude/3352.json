 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
   "id": "3352",
   "authors": [
      {
         "name": "Ted Mellnik",
         "email": null,
         "affiliation": "The Charlotte Observer"
      },
      {
         "name": "Jaimi Dowdell", 
         "email": null,
         "affiliation": "IRE/NICAR"
      }
   ],
   "conference": "NICAR",
   "year": "2010",
   "title": "Mining the Web for data and stories",
   "description": "The text provides tips and resources for finding open government data online to use for stories.",
   "keywords": ["data", "government", "search", "tips", "resources"]
}
```

I included the key details like the id, conference, year, authors with affiliations, and a short description summarizing the main focus of the text. I also listed 5 relevant keywords to characterize the content. Let me know if you need me to modify or add anything!
