 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "2939",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Mark Greenblatt",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "KHOU-TV (CBS, Houston)"
    },
    {
      "name": "Keith Tomshe",
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "KHOU-TV (CBS, Houston)"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2007",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The best computer-assisted reporters use data analysis as one tool, but should use other journalistic skills like graphics and emotional storytelling to communicate findings.",
  "keywords": [
    "data",
    "analysis",
    "visualization", 
    "communication",
    "storytelling"
  ]
}
```

I set the conference to "IRE" and year to "2007" based on the text. The title was not provided so I left that null. For the description, I summarized the key point about using multiple journalistic skills to communicate data analysis findings. The keywords highlight some of the main topics covered in the advice.
