 Here is the JSON object for text #3718:

```json
{
    "id": "3718",
    "authors": [
        {"name": "Ana Lourdes Cardenas", "email": "analourdes3@gmail.com", "affiliation": "SomosFrontera.com/El Paso Times"},
        {"name": "Kevin Rothstein", "email": null, "affiliation": "Fox 25 WFXT in Boston"},
        {"name": "Mc Nelly Torres", "email": "Torres.mcnelly@gmail.com", "affiliation": "Florida Center for Investigative Reporting (Moderator)"},
        {"name": "Jessica Vaughan", "email": "jessicavaughan@verizon.net", "affiliation": "Center for Immigration Studies"}
    ],
    "conference": "NICAR",
    "year": "Not Listed",
    "title": "Covering Immigration",
    "description": "Tips and resources for journalists reporting on immigration issues.",
    "keywords": ["immigration", "reporting", "tips", "data", "policy"]
}
```

I extracted the author names, emails, and affiliations from the text. The conference was not listed, so I put "Not Listed". There was no clear year, so I also put "Not Listed" for that. For the description, I summarized the main topic. And for keywords, I included some topical words related to the content.
