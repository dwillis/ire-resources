 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
   "id":"T1782",
   "authors":[
      {
         "name":"Shawn McIntosh",
         "email":"smcintosh@ajc.com",
         "affiliation":"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution"
      },
      {
         "name":"Rose Ciotta",
         "email":"rciotta@phillynews.com",
         "affiliation":"The Philadelphia Inquirer"  
      },
      {
         "name":"Michael Weinstein",
         "email":"mweinstein@charlotteobserver.com",
         "affiliation":"The Charlotte Observer"
      }
   ],
   "conference":"NICAR",
   "year":"2003",
   "title":"Managing and writing for impact",
   "description":"Guidelines in three phases for developing, researching and completing an in-depth journalism project or series.",
   "keywords":[
      "project management",
      "investigative reporting",
      "data analysis",
      "writing",
      "teamwork"
   ]
}
```

I extracted the author names, emails and affiliations from the text. Since a conference and year were listed, I used those values. The description summarizes the main points, and the keywords list some major themes.
