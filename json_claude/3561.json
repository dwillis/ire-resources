 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "3561",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "IRE - Orlando"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE", 
  "year": "2011",
  "title": "How to apply for a grant?",
  "description": "An introduction to applying for grants for investigative journalism projects.",
  "keywords": [
    "grant",
    "investigative journalism",
    "funding",
    "application",
    "tips"
  ]
}
```

I extracted the conference "IRE" and year "2011" from the text. The authors section has null values since no author names were provided. The affiliation comes from "IRE - Orlando" in the text. The description summarizes the main topic. And the keywords list some relevant terms related to the content.
