 Here is the JSON object for the input:

```json
{
  "id": "5533",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "InvestigateTV"
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "IRE/NICAR" 
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "We are in the human business",
  "description": "Tips on developing sources for investigative reporting, including building trust, backgrounding sources, and avoiding surprises.",
  "keywords": [
    "sources",
    "investigative reporting", 
    "journalism",
    "reporting",
    "tips"
  ]
}
```

I summarized the key points about developing sources and finding information through interviews and contacts. Since no authors, conference, or year were clearly listed, I left those values mostly empty or as "Not Listed". The keywords cover some of the main topics discussed in the tips without duplicate conference/author terms.
