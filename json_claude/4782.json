 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4782",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Jennifer Valentino-DeVries", 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Wall Street Journal"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2016",
  "title": "Protecting Your Stuff",
  "description": "Outlines digital security tips and tools for journalists.",
  "keywords": [
    "security",
    "encryption",
    "privacy", 
    "threat modeling",
    "operational security"
  ] 
}
```

I set the conference to "IRE" since that acronym appears in the text. The year is listed as 2016. For the author, I included the name listed and used the affiliation of The Wall Street Journal based on the email address. The description is a short 2 sentence summary. And I chose 5 relevant keywords related to the topic of the presentation.
