 Here is the JSON object created from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5642_2",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Hilary Niles",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    },
    {
      "name": "Mc Nelly Torres",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null  
    },
    {
      "name": "Cat Ferguson",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    },  
    {
      "name": "Samantha Sunne",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2018",
  "title": "The Freelance Investigation",
  "description": "Tips for freelance investigative journalists on setting up a workspace, building relationships with editors, working with grants and deciding on a workflow.", 
  "keywords": [
    "freelance",
    "investigative",
    "journalism",  
    "workflow",
    "grants"
  ]
}
```

I created the id, parsed out the author names, set the conference to "IRE" since it was in the title, set the year to 2018, created a two sentence summary of the tips, and included keywords like freelance, investigative, workflow and grants. Let me know if you need any changes to this.
