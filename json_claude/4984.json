 Here is the JSON object based on the input text:

```json
{
   "id": "4984",
   "authors": [{
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "WNYC"
   },
   {
      "name": null, 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "ProPublica"
   }],
   "conference": "Not Listed",
   "year": "Not Listed",
   "title": "User testing: Gathering insight to make better stories",
   "description": "An overview of user testing and why it's valuable for creating understandable stories.",
   "keywords": ["usability", "testing", "users", "understanding", "stories"]
}
```

I left the author names as null since none were listed. The affiliations are based on the organizations mentioned in the text. The description is a short 1-2 sentence summary. The conference and year are "Not Listed" since those details were not provided. The keywords list relevant terms excluding the conference and authors.
