 Here is the JSON object for the text:

```json
{
    "id": "T2067",
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": "Mike Fish",
            "email": "mike_fish@simail.com", 
            "affiliation": "SportsIllustrated.com"
        },
        {
            "name": "John Sugg",
            "email": null,
            "affiliation": "Creative Loafing"
        },
        {
            "name": "MaryJo Sylwester",
            "email": null,

    ],
    "conference": "IRE",

    "title": "Investigating Sports",
    "description": "The author discusses techniques and practices for investigating stories in sports reporting using public records and documents.",
    "keywords": [

        "reporting",
        "investigating", 
        "records",
        "documents"
    ]
}
```

I extracted the key information from the text and structured it as requested in the JSON format with appropriate data types and quotemark delimiters. The description summarizes the main topic, and keywords list some of the main themes. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON.
