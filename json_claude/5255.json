 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5255",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Christy George", "email": null, "affiliation": null},
    {"name": "Jeff Burnside", "email": null, "affiliation": null},
    {"name": "Tony Davis", "email": null, "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Changing Climate, Changing Weather",
  "description": "The text provides resources and examples of local climate change stories for TV news reporting.",
  "keywords": ["climate change", "extreme weather", "TV news", "story ideas", "resources"]
}
```

I extracted the author names that were listed, used "Not Listed" for the conference and year since those details were not clearly provided, created a short 2 sentence summary for the description, and listed 5 relevant keywords. All keys and values are enclosed in quotemarks.
