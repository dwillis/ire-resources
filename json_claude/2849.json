 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "2849",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Star-Ledger"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "A presentation showing four examples of using math to analyze data for news stories.",
  "keywords": ["math", "data", "analysis", "news", "stories"]
}
```

I summarized the main points about using math for data analysis in news stories for the description, and included relevant keywords without repeating terms already captured in other fields. Let me know if you need any clarification or have suggestions for improvement!
