 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5627",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Joey Cranney", "email": null, "affiliation": "The Advocate"},
    {"name": "Brett Murphy", "email": null, "affiliation": "USA TODAY"}, 
    {"name": "Katie Shepherd", "email": null, "affiliation": "Willamette Week"}
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Local Watchdog Showcase",
  "description": "Local reporters highlight recent examples of investigative journalism exposing wrongdoing in communities across the country.",
  "keywords": ["investigative journalism", "local reporting", "watchdog", "wrongdoing", "community"]
}
```

I extracted the author names, detected "The Advocate" and "USA TODAY" as likely affiliations, summarized the description, identified the conference as IRE based on the newsletter text, and listed five relevant keywords. Let me know if you would like me to modify anything!
