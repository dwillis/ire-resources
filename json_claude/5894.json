 Here is the JSON object generated from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5894",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Miles Moffeit",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "dallasnews.com"
    },
    {
      "name": "Sarah Smith",
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "chron.com"
    },
    {
      "name": "Anjali Kamat",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "wnyc.org" 
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2019",
  "title": "Tip Sheet",
  "description": "A tip sheet providing guidance on investigating trauma and abuse cases by building trust with survivors, understanding PTSD, finding experts, and practicing self-care.",
  "keywords": [
    "abuse", 
    "investigations", 
    "trauma",
    "PTSD",
    "interviews"
  ]
}
```

I extracted the conference name, year, and author information from the text. Since no formal title was provided, I used "Tip Sheet" based on the opening line. The description summarizes the overall purpose and content. The keywords list the main topics covered without repeating information already captured in other fields.
