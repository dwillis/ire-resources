 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": 4452,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Wisconsin Watch"
    },
    {
      "name": "Ellen Gabler",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    },
    { 
      "name": "Kate Golden",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Wisconsin Watch"
    },
    {
      "name": "Lauren Fuhrmann",
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "Wisconsin Watch"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Free tools and techniques to help us be better watchdog reporters",
  "description": "A list of free tools and tips for journalists to help with organization, data analysis, writing, collaboration and publishing stories.",
  "keywords": [ 
    "tools",
    "data",
    "writing",
    "collaboration",
    "publishing"
  ]
}
```

I left the names, emails and affiliations null when not provided. The conference is listed as NICAR based on the URL. The year is not clearly stated, so I put "Not Listed". The description summarizes the main aspects covered in the tools and tips. And I selected 5 keywords reflecting the overall themes and content. Please let me know if you would like me to modify anything!
