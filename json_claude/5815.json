 Here is the JSON object created from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "5815",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null, 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "",
  "description": "The text does not contain enough information to generate a JSON object with the required keys and values.",
  "keywords": []
}
```

I left the authors list empty since no author names were provided. The conference, year, title and keywords are also empty or set to "Not Listed" since those details were not included. The description summarizes that there is not enough information in the input text to populate the JSON as requested.
