 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5681",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Mark Mazzetti", "email": null, "affiliation": "New York Times"},
    {"name": "Jeremy Rogalski", "email": null, "affiliation": "KHOU-TV"}, 
    {"name": "Ziva Branstetter", "email": null, "affiliation": "Reveal"}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "The Rolling Investigation",
  "description": "Tips for coordinating and following up on an ongoing investigative story as new information emerges.",
  "keywords": ["investigation", "reporting", "tips", "follow up", "impact"]  
}
```

I extracted the author names and affiliations where available. Since no email addresses were provided, I left those as null values. The conference and year were not clearly stated, so I put "Not Listed". The description is a high-level 1-2 sentence summary, and I chose 5 representative keywords from the content.
