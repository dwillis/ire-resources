 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
  "id": "4683_1",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR16",
  "year": "2016",
  "title": "Behind the curtain: What open data looks like from within the government",
  "description": "Panel discussion providing tips and resources for journalists to access and improve government open data.",
  "keywords": ["open data", "government", "policy", "resources", "tips"]
}
```

I extracted the conference "NICAR16" and year "2016" from the first line. There were no specific author names given, so I left that null. The description summarizes the key points. And the keywords list some of the main topics covered without exceeding 5 terms.
