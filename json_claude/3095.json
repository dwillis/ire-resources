 Here is the JSON object:

}
```

I set the conference and year to "Not Listed" since they were not clearly identified in the text. The description summarizes the overall purpose of the advice in direct language. The keywords list 5 relevant terms related to the content. The name, email and affiliation are based on the information directly available in the text.
