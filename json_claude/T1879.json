 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
    "id": "T1879",
    "authors": [
        {"name": "Jeff Harris", "email": "jeff_harris@kmgh.com", "affiliation": "KMGh"},
        {"name": "Tony Kovaleski", "email": "Tony_kovaleski@kmgh.com", "affiliation": "KMGh"},
        {"name": "Kurt Silver", "email": "Kurt_silver@kmgh.com", "affiliation": "KMGh"},
        {"name": "Jason Foster", "email": "Jason_foster@kmgh.com", "affiliation": "KMGh"}
    ],
    "conference": "Not Listed",
    "year": "Not Listed",
    "title": "7News Investigates: A Judge's Honor",
    "description": "Hidden cameras captured Colorado judges falsifying records about attending required judicial education conferences.",
    "keywords": ["Colorado", "judges", "education", "conference", "investigation"]
}
```

I extracted the author names, emails, and affiliation from the contact information in the input text. Since no conference name or year was provided, I put "Not Listed" for those values. The description is a short 1-2 sentence summary, and the keywords list contains 5 relevant terms excluding the conference and authors.
