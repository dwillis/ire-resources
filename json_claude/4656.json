 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
    "id": 4656,
    "authors": [
        {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "ProPublica"},
        {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": null}
    ],
    "conference": "NICAR",
    "year": 2016,
    "title": "Scraping without programming",
    "description": "An introduction to web scraping using tools like Google Sheets, OutWit Hub and import.io.",
    "keywords": ["scraping", "data", "journalism", "tools"]
}
```

I set the conference to "NICAR" and the year to 2016 based on context clues in the text. For the authors, I saw a mention of ProPublica so used that as an affiliation, but did not have any actual author names to include. The description is a short 1 sentence summary, and the keywords list contains relevant terms related to the content that aren't already captured in other fields. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON!
