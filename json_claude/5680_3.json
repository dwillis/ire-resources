 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
  "id": "5680_3",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Leslie Eaton",
      "email": "leaton@dallasnews.com",
      "affiliation": "The Dallas Morning News"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "TIPS on story structure and writing for investigations that engage readers",
  "description": "Gives advice on how to structure an investigative story to keep readers engaged, including starting with a clear main point, using chronological order, and editing for brevity.",
  "keywords": ["writing", "editing", "story structure", "investigations", "engagement"]
}
```

I made the following assumptions:

- There is one listed author, Leslie Eaton, with email and affiliation
- The conference and year are not clearly identified
- The keywords summarize the key topics covered in the advice

Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON!
