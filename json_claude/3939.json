 Here is the JSON object generated from the input:

  "title": "The Court Data Problem",
  "description": "Most courts have poor data systems, which makes analysis difficult, but some ways around this include using available court reports, being skeptical of lawyer-generated data, scraping what exists, and manually filling gaps.",
  "keywords": [
    "courts",
    "data", 
    "analysis",
    "reports", 
    "scraping"
  ] 
}
```

I did not make up any author names since none were listed, used "USA TODAY" as the affiliation since that was the only organization named, and created a short 2 sentence summary for the description. The conference, year, and keywords follow the instructions provided.
