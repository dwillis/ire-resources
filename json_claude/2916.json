 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
   "id": "2916",
   "authors":[
      {
         "name":null,
         "email":"mntorres@sun-sentinel.com",
         "affiliation":"South Florida Sun-Sentinel"
      },
      {
         "name":"Joe Ducey",
         "email":null,
         "affiliation":"KNXV-Phoenix"  
      },
      {
         "name":"Lea Thompson",
         "email":"thompson.lea@gmail.com",
         "affiliation":null
      }
   ],
   "conference":"IRE",
   "year":"2007",
   "title":"Consumer investigations: How to dig out good stories and keep your audience asking for more",
   "description":"The text provides tips on uncovering and reporting on consumer issues and problems.",
   "keywords":[
      "consumers",
      "investigations",
      "sources",
      "databases",
      "solutions"
   ]
}
```

I set the conference to "IRE" since it mentions the "IRE Conference" in Phoenix. The year is listed as 2007. For the description, I summarized the main focus of the text. And for keywords, I picked out a few topics central to the content.
