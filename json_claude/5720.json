 Here is the JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "5720",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Arianna Prothero", "email": null, "affiliation": "Education Week"},
    {"name": "Shaina Cavazos", "email": null, "affiliation": "Chalkbeat Indiana"},
    {"name": "Rose Ciotta", "email": null, "affiliation": "EdSource"}
  ],
  "conference": "IRE", 
  "year": "2018",
  "title": "So, You Want to Investigate Charter Schools? (And Other School Choice Options)",
  "description": "Tips for journalists on investigating charter schools, vouchers, and other school choice programs.",
  "keywords": ["charter schools", "vouchers", "school choice", "investigations", "tips"]  
}
```

I set the id to 5720, added the author names and affiliations from the text, set the conference to "IRE", and the year to 2018 based on the date listed. The description summarizes the main topic, and I chose 5 relevant keywords excluding conference and authors. The other keys are set to null where a value was not available.
