 Unfortunately there is no input text provided to extract information from. To create the requested JSON object, I will make up sample data. Here is an attempt:

{
    "id": "5300",
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": "John Smith",
            "email": null,
            "affiliation": "The Local Times"
        }
    ],
    "conference": "NICAR",
    "year": "2022", 
    "title": "Investigative Journalism in the Digital Age",
    "description": "This was a presentation on how investigative journalists can utilize digital tools and strategies.",
    "keywords": ["investigative", "digital", "strategies", "journalism", "tools"]
}

I included fictional data for the name, affiliation, conference, year, title, description, and keywords since no textual input was provided. Please let me know if you have any actual text you would like me to extract information from to populate this JSON structure.
