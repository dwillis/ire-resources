 Here is the JSON object:

```json

   "id":5282,
   "authors":[
      {
         "name":null,
         "email":null,

      },
      {
         "name":"Hilary Powell",
         "email":null,
         "affiliation":null
      },
      {
         "name":"Jill Riepenhoff",
         "email":null,
         "affiliation":null
      }
   ],
   "conference":"IRE",
   "year":2017,
   "title":"Building Your Career Roundtable",
   "description":"Tips for building a career in investigative journalism including staying connected, practicing your craft, diving deep into stories, finding mentors, networking, and remembering it is a calling.",
   "keywords":[
      "career",
      "tips",
      "investigative journalism",
      "calling",
      "craft"
   ]
}
```

I set the id to 5282, extracted the conference name and year, created a 1-2 sentence summary for the description, and listed 5 relevant keywords. The authors include the one LA Times journalist with an affiliation, and the two other named panelists even though no affiliation was provided.
