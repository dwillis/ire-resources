  "description": "A panel of experts will explore opportunities and challenges regarding geographic and location-based data in newsrooms.",
  "keywords": ["geo", "location", "data", "journalism", "news"]
}
```

I set the conference to "NICAR" since that was mentioned in the location and date. The year was listed as 2018. I summarized the main topic of the panel in the description, and included relevant keywords about geographic data and journalism. The authors are the listed speakers, with affiliations if provided. The id and other unspecified fields are set to the requested defaults.
