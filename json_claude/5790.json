 Unfortunately I do not have enough context to fully construct the JSON object you described. From the information provided, I can create a partial JSON object with some default values:

```json
{
  "id": "5790",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null  
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": []
}
```

To fully populate this object, I would need more details from the original text such as the title, authors, conference name and year (if listed), a short description, and relevant keywords. Please provide the full text or more context about the content, and I'm happy to try generating the JSON object again.
