 Unfortunately I do not have access to the full text that was provided as input. Based on the instructions, here is an example JSON object I could create:

```json
{
  "id": "5647_2",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "",
  "description": "",
  "keywords": [] 
}
```

Since I don't have the actual text, the title and description are empty strings, there are no author details, the conference and year are "Not Listed", and there are no keywords. Please provide the full input text and I would be happy to create the JSON object with extracted details based on the instructions.
