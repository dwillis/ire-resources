 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5749",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "ProPublica"
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    },
    {
      "name": null, 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Washington Post"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2019",
  "title": "How and why to make your data analysis reproducible",
  "description": "Panelists discuss why using standardized processes for data collection, cleaning and analysis is important and share practices that work.",
  "keywords": [
    "reproducibility",
    "data analysis",
    "workflows",
    "documentation"
  ]
}
```

I parsed the text to identify the conference (NICAR), year (2019), and authors' affiliations (ProPublica and The Washington Post). The description summarizes the main points in simple language. The keywords list relevant terms related to the themes of the panel.
