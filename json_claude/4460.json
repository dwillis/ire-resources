 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4460",
  "authors": [

    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "Wisconsin Public Radio"},
    {"name": "Dee J. Hall", "email": null, "affiliation": "Wisconsin State Journal"}
  ],
  "conference": "Midwest Watchdog Workshop",
  "year": "2015",

  "description": "Tipsheet for journalists on covering state legislatures and governor's offices, including sources of information and how to build relationships with lawmakers.",
  "keywords": ["legislature", "reporting", "Capitol", "state government", "tips"]
}
```

I extracted the conference name, year, and author affiliations from the text. The description summarizes the main topic. And I chose 5 relevant keywords.
