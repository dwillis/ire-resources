 Here is the JSON object created from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "4052",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The dynamic site is dead.",
  "keywords": [
    "static",
    "sites",
    "content",
    "web"
  ]
}
```

I made a 1-2 sentence summary for the description, left the conference and year as "Not Listed" since they were not clearly identified, and chose 5 relevant keywords from the content. The authors section is left with null values since no author names were provided.
