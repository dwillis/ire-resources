 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

{
    "id": 3347,
    "authors": [
        {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "Washington Post"},
        {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": null}
    ],
    "conference": "NICAR", 
    "year": 2010,
    "title": "Using the Google Maps Flash API with Flex", 
    "description": "A presentation explaining how to use the Google Maps Flash API to build mapping applications with Adobe Flex.",
    "keywords": ["Flex", "Flash", "Google Maps", "GIS", "mapping"]
}

I extracted the conference name and year from the first line. The first author is affiliated with the Washington Post based on the mention in the text. The second author has no identifiable information so I left those fields null. The description summarizes the main topic and purpose of the presentation. And I chose some relevant keywords related to the techniques discussed.
