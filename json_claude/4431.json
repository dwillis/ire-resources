 Here is the JSON object created from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4431",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "New York Times"},
    {"name": "Aurelia Moser", "email": null, "affiliation": null},
    {"name": "Chris Keller", "email": null, "affiliation": "KPCC"}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2016",
  "title": "WHAT WE TALK ABOUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT DATA SMELLS",
  "description": "The session explores the concept of \"data smells,\" which refer to common data quality issues, with the goal of collecting examples into a compendium or encyclopedia.",
  "keywords": ["data", "quality", "issues", "examples", "compendium"]
}
```

I summarized the key details from the text to populate the JSON object. The id is set to 4431. The authors array contains objects for the listed facilitators, using the news organizations as affiliations where available. The conference is NICAR and the year 2016 based on the text. The title and description summarize the goal of the session. And the keywords list several relevant terms related to the topic.
