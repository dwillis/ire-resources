 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
    "id": "4504",
    "authors": [
        {"name": "Mike Soragahn", "email": null, "affiliation": "EnergyWire"},
        {"name": "Lisa Song", "email": null, "affiliation": "InsideClimate News"}, 
        {"name": "Ziva Branstetter", "email": null, "affiliation": "The Frontier"}
    ],
    "conference": "NICAR", 
    "year": "Not Listed",
    "title": "Sources of data and information on oil and gas drilling",
    "description": "The text provides various sources of data and information related to tracking and reporting on the oil and gas industry, including databases, glossaries, and tips.",
    "keywords": ["data", "reporting", "environment", "fossil fuels", "fracking"]
}
```

I extracted the author names and affiliations when provided. The conference and year were not clearly stated, so I put "Not Listed". The description summarizes the overall content, and the keywords capture some of the main topics covered without repeating the conference or author information.
