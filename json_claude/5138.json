 Unfortunately there is no input text provided to extract information from. To create the requested JSON object, I will make up sample data. Here is an example JSON object with made up data:

```json
{
  "id": "5138",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "John Smith", 
      "email": "jsmith@newyorktimes.com",
      "affiliation": "The New York Times"
    },
    {
      "name": "Jane Doe",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "CNN"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2019",
  "title": "Investigative Data Journalism",
  "description": "This panel discussed techniques and tools for using data to uncover stories.", 
  "keywords": ["journalism", "data", "investigation", "stories", "reporting"]
}
```

I included all the requested keys, set the id to 5138, created a sample authors array with name, email, and affiliation, made up a fake conference, year, title, description, and keywords. Let me know if you have any actual input text you would like me to parse into this structure.
