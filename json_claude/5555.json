 Unfortunately I do not have enough context to create a full JSON object from the provided text. If you could provide the original text you wished to convert to JSON, I would be happy to attempt creating an appropriate JSON representation. Without any text to analyze, the best I can do is provide an example JSON template with the requested keys, but placeholder values:

```json
{
  "id": "5555",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "",
  "description": "",
  "keywords": [
    "",
    "",
    "",
    "",
    ""
  ]
}
```

Please provide the original text you need converted and I will do my best to populate an appropriate JSON object.
