 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

      "email": "laurenÂ­mills@iowawatch.org",
      "affiliation": "IowaWatch"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2014",
  "title": "Collaboration: Bringing students into your investigation",
  "description": "The text discusses best practices and expectations for collaborations between professional journalists and student journalists on investigative projects.",
  "keywords": [
    "collaboration",
    "investigation",
    "students", 
    "interns",
    "projects"
  ]
}
```

I extracted the conference name, year, and title from the first section. For the authors, I included the names and emails listed, and used the news organization names as affiliations where available. The description summarizes the main topic, and the keywords list relevant terms except for the conference and author information.
