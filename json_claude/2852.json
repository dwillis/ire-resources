 Unfortunately I do not have enough context to generate a full JSON object from your instructions. If you could provide the original text you would like me to parse, I would be happy to try again. Without any sample input text, the best I can do is provide a JSON template with null values:

{
  "id": 2852,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null 
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": [
    null,
    null,
    null,
    null,
    null
  ]
}

Please provide the original text and I will try to populate this template appropriately. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON structure.
