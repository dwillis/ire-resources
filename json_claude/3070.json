 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "3070",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "St. Petersburg Times"},
    {"name": "Carolyn Edds", "email": null, "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "2008",
  "title": "Web sites and search techniques for reporters",
  "description": "A presentation covering various websites and search techniques useful for reporters doing research.",
  "keywords": ["Google", "search", "newspapers", "public records", "tipsheets"] 
}
```

I set the conference to "NICAR" since that was mentioned, the year to 2008 since that was given, and summarized the content in the description. For authors, I included the St. Petersburg Times since that was mentioned as Carolyn Edds' affiliation, and included her as an author as well with null values for missing info. The keywords cover some of the major topics mentioned without repeating conference/authors. Let me know if you need any clarification or have feedback on improving this!
