 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
  "id": "5933",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Open Contracting Partnership"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Using data to uncover corruption in public procurement",
  "description": "Guidelines and red flags for investigating corruption in government procurement by linking open contracting data with other databases.",
  "keywords": [
    "corruption",
    "procurement", 
    "data",
    "investigation",
    "transparency"
  ]
}
```

I extracted the author name "Georg Neumann" but did not include it since the instructions said to leave author name null if not explicitly listed. The affiliation is the Open Contracting Partnership based on context. The summary description, conference, year and keywords were filled out according to the specifications in the instructions.
