 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "3800",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "El Diario"},
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "El País"}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "\"El jefe narco presumió en Facebook sus lujos y poderío\"",
  "description": "A Mexican drug cartel leader flaunted his luxurious lifestyle and firepower on Facebook before being arrested.",
  "keywords": ["Mexico", "drug cartel", "Facebook", "arrest"] 
}
```

I included "El Diario" and "El País" as the affiliations for the authors since those news organizations were mentioned. The description summarizes the key details, and the keywords capture additional relevant terms. Let me know if you need any changes to this JSON structure.
