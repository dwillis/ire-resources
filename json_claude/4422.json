 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4422",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Foreign Policy magazine"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2015",
  "title": "Catching Fire",
  "description": "Spreading data journalism through the newsroom by training reporters, producers, editors and freelancers on topics like data visualization, spreadsheet skills and evaluating data quality.",
  "keywords": [
    "data journalism",
    "newsroom", "training", "data visualization", "spreadsheets"
  ]
}
```

I included "Foreign Policy magazine" as the affiliation since the speaker is identified as the Director of Digital Content Development there. The conference is listed as NICAR based on the context. The year is listed as 2015 since that seems to be when the talk was given based on the tweet date. The description is my own 1-2 sentence summary, and the keywords are the top 5 terms I extracted related to the key topics, excluding the conference and author information.
