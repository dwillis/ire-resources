 Here is the JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "3959",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": null},
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Beyond tweets and twibbons: Media lessons from Boston",
  "description": "The text discusses media coverage and use of social media during the Boston Marathon bombing incident in 2013.",
  "keywords": ["media", "social media", "Boston", "bombing", "coverage"]  
}
```

I left the author names and emails as null since none were listed. The affiliation is also null. The conference and year are "Not Listed" since those details were not provided. The description summarizes the key points, and keywords list relevant terms excluding the conference and authors.
