 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": 3202,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2009",
  "title": "From Data Analysis to Programming Panel",
  "description": "Panel from NICAR 2009 conference covering topics like dealing with bad data, data structures, programming languages, version control, programming techniques, and sharing code.",
  "keywords": [
    "data analysis",
    "programming",
    "SQL",
    "Perl",
    "version control" 
  ]
}
```

I set the conference to "NICAR" based on the first line, the year to "2009" also from the first line, and created a description summarizing the key points. The keywords list contains some relevant topics covered without duplicating the conference name or authors. The id is set to 3202 as requested and the authors array has a single empty author entry since no author names were provided.
