 Unfortunately I do not have access to the full text that was provided as input. Based on the information in your instructions, here is an attempt at creating the requested JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "5319",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null 
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": []
}
```

I've included the requested keys and formatted it as a JSON object, but without any text to summarize I could not provide values for the title, description, authors, keywords, etc. Please provide the full text you would like summarized and I would be happy to update my response. Let me know if you have any other questions!
