 Here is the JSON object created from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "5066",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Julia Angwin", "email": null, "affiliation": "ProPublica"},
    {"name": "Jon Keegan", "email": null, "affiliation": null}, 
    {"name": "Jeremy B Merrill", "email": null, "affiliation": "The New York Times"}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The authors discuss what Facebook knows about its users based on their research and browser extensions to track Facebook data.",
  "keywords": ["Facebook", "data", "privacy", "tracking", "ads"]
}
```

I set the conference to "NICAR" since that seems to be implied from the context. The year is listed as "Not Listed" since a specific year is not given. The title is null since one was not provided. The description summarizes the key points made in the text. The keywords list relevant terms related to the content.
