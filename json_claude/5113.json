 Here is the JSON object created from the input text:

```json
{
   "id":5113,
   "authors":[
      {
         "name":null,
         "email":null,
         "affiliation":"WNBC-TV"
      }
   ],
   "conference":"IRE",
   "year":"Not Listed",
   "title":"The Art of the Interview",
   "description":"An expert journalist provides tips on conducting successful interviews such as establishing rapport, limiting small talk with targets, preparing sound bites, and more.",
   "keywords":[
      "interview",
      "conversation",
      "sound bites",
      "preparation",
      "targets"
   ]
}
```

I extracted the conference name, left the year blank since it was not clearly identified, created a 1-2 sentence high-level summary for the description, and listed relevant keywords. The author name was not provided, so I left it null but included the news organization affiliation that was mentioned. Let me know if you need any changes to this JSON or have additional requirements!
