 Here is the JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "3060",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "John Maines",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "South Florida Sun Sentinel (Fort Lauderdale)"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",  
  "year": "2008",
  "title": "Building a Database",
  "description": "Tipsheet with advice on building your own database for a journalistic investigation or story.",
  "keywords": ["database", "tips", "DIY", "investigation", "journalism"]  
}
```

I extracted the author name, email, and affiliation from the byline. Since no conference name or year was explicitly listed, I put "NICAR" for the conference and "2008" for the year based on context clues. The description summarizes the main focus of the text, and the keywords list salient terms related to the content.
