 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "T1897",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Herbal Hazards",
  "description": "The article discusses concerns about regulation and testing of ayurvedic medicines sold in India.",
  "keywords": ["ayurveda", "herbal medicine", "regulation", "safety"]
}
```

I left the authors section blank since no author names were provided. The conference, year, and affiliation are listed as "Not Listed" since those details were not included. The description is a brief 1-2 sentence summary, and keywords covers some of the main topics without the conference or authors.
