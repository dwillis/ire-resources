 Unfortunately there is not enough information provided in the text fragments to construct the requested JSON object. There are no mentions of authors, conferences, years, titles or descriptions from which to extract the necessary values. The only key I could populate would be the id with the value "_Katie_Park_". Here is the JSON object with just the id key included:

{"id": "_Katie_Park_"}

To construct a more complete JSON object matching the provided specifications, the text would need to include more contextual details and metadata about its source and content. Please provide text with additional information and I will try again to extract the requested keys and values.
