 Unfortunately I do not have enough context to generate the full JSON object you requested based on the text provided. The text seems to provide advice on investigating public officials, but does not include typical academic conference information like author names, conference name, year, etc. I can provide a partial JSON object with some of the requested keys filled in based on my interpretation of the text:

```json
{
  "id": 4178,
  "authors": [], 
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "Text provides advice on investigating and profiling public officials accused of misconduct in order to understand their motivations and veracity.",
  "keywords": ["investigation", "profiling", "public officials", "misconduct"]
}
```

Please provide more complete academic/conference-related source material if you would like me to generate a full JSON object with all requested keys. I'd be happy to try again with more context.
