 Unfortunately the text you provided does not contain structured data that can be easily converted to JSON. It appears to be an article about police shootings of Latinos in the US. Here is my attempt at creating a JSON object that summarizes some of the key information:

```json
{
  "id": "4473",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Sabrina Vourvoulias",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "AL D√çA News Media"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Why do I cast no shadow? Reaction and non-reaction to the police shootings of Latinos in the U.S.",
  "description": "An article exploring national and local community reaction to some of the lethal police shootings of Latinos that have taken place in 2015.",
  "keywords": [
    "police shootings",
    "Latinos",
    "lethal force"
  ]
}
```

I extracted the one clear author name and affiliation. Since no conference, year or email is listed, I put "Not Listed" for those values. The title and description summarize the overall topic based on skimming the content. And I chose a few relevant keywords. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON structure!
