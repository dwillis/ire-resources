 Here is my attempt at creating the requested JSON object from the text:

```json
{
  "id": "5467",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Alex Howard", "email": null, "affiliation": "@digiphile"},
    {"name": "Hilary Niles", "email": null, "affiliation": "@nilesmedia"}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "2018",
  "title": "Tracking Trump's Conflicts of Interest",
  "description": "The presentation discusses tracking and reporting on President Trump's conflicts of interest using structured data.",
  "keywords": ["politics", "data", "journalism", "reporting", "transparency"]
}
```

I included the Twitter handles as affiliations for the two listed authors, used "NICAR" as the conference name since it's mentioned, put 2018 as the year, and created a short description summary. The keywords list contains a few relevant terms related to the topics covered. Let me know if you need any clarification or changes to this JSON!
