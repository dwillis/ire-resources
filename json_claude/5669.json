 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5669",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "IRE"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "How We Got the Story",
  "description": "A story about getting an investigative story.",
  "keywords": [
    "story",
    "investigative",
    "reporting"
  ]
}
```

I set the id to 5669 as requested. The author name and email are null since none were provided. The text mentions IRE so I used that as the affiliation. The conference is set to IRE based on the text. No year is provided so I put "Not Listed". The title and description are very simple summaries based on the text. And I included a few keywords related to the investigative story and reporting.
