 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "T1991",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Nils Mulvad",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Dicar"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Tactical considerations when applying for access to documents and data",
  "description": "Provides tactics for journalists seeking access to documents and data in any country based on experiences in Denmark.",
  "keywords": [
    "access",
    "documents",
    "data",
    "journalists",
    "tactics"
  ] 
}
```

I extracted the only named author, Nils Mulvad, and used his affiliation listed in the text, Dicar. Since no conference or year is mentioned, I put "Not Listed" for those fields. The description summarizes the overall purpose of the text. And I chose 5 relevant keywords to represent main topics covered. Please let me know if you would like me to modify or improve the JSON object in any way!
