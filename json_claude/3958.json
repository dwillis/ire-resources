 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "3958",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Marshall Zelinger",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "thedenverchannel.com"
    },
    {
      "name": "Amanda Kost", 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "kmgh.com"
    },
    {
      "name": "Mike Beaudet",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "foxtv.com"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "Guidelines and tips for investigating breaking news stories and developing follow-up coverage over time.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigating",
    "records",
    "sources",
    "planning",
    "content"
  ]
}
```

I summarized the key points about investigating and following up on breaking news stories for the description. For the keywords, I focused on the main themes related to investigating, finding sources/content, and planning continued coverage. The conference and year were not clearly identified, so I put "Not Listed". The title was not included so I left that null. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
