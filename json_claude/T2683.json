 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
    "id": "T2683",
    "authors": [
        {"name": "David Barnes", "email": null, "affiliation": "Office of Inspector General, U.S. Department of Transportation"},
        {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "Office of Inspector General, U.S. Department of Transportation"}
    ],
    "conference": "Not Listed", 
    "year": "Not Listed",
    "title": "Reporting on Federally-Funded Highway and Transit Projects",
    "description": "This handout is designed to assist reporters covering highway, transit and airport construction projects involving the use of federal funds.",
    "keywords": ["transportation", "fraud", "oversight", "highway", "transit"]
}
```

I extracted the key information from the text to populate the JSON object as specified in the instructions. The id is set to T2683. The authors list contains two elements - one for David Barnes and one with no name given the multiple attributions to the Office of Inspector General. The conference, year, title, and description are taken directly from the text. Finally, I selected five relevant keywords to describe the content.
