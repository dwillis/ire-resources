 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "T2541",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "Barron's"}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "The Skinny On Doctors",
  "description": "An article criticizes a Seattle Times story for mistakes in reporting on doctors taking money from Wall Street to discuss investigational drugs.",
  "keywords": ["doctors", "ethics", "journalism", "pharmaceuticals", "finance"]
}
```

I extracted the key information to populate the JSON object keys based on your instructions. The affiliation is listed as Barron's since that seems to be the news organization the author is from. The conference, year, and authors name were left as "Not Listed" or null since they were not clearly identified. The description is a short 1-2 sentence summary, and keywords are relevant terms from the content.
