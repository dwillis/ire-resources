 Here is the JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": 3489,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Loretta Auvil",  
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "CAR", 
  "year": "2011",
  "title": "Visualizing Text",
  "description": "Tipsheet provides an overview of text visualization methods and tools.",
  "keywords": [ 
    "text analysis",
    "visualization", 
    "tools"
  ]
}
```

I set the conference to "CAR" based on the text, the year to 2011 since that date is listed, and created a 1-2 sentence description summarizing the main topic. The only author name listed is Loretta Auvil, so I included that with null values for email and affiliation since those are not provided. Finally, I chose a few relevant keywords related to the text analysis and visualization topics covered.
