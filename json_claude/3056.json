 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "3056",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Doug Haddix", 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Columbus Dispatch"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2008",
  "title": "Freshness. Even on a familiar topic, a new twist can make people care again or care in a different way. Creative ideas win readers. Spend more time coming up with fresh approaches and less time doing routine stories.",
  "description": "Tips for computer-assisted reporting to make stories more compelling and connect with readers.",
  "keywords": [
    "freshness",
    "nosy neighbor", 
    "strategic reporting",
    "relevance",
    "nerd box"
  ]
}
```

I extracted the author name, email, and affiliation from the text. The conference, year, and title come directly from the text. The description is a 1-2 sentence summary, and the keywords are important terms related to the tips excluding the conference and author information.
