 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "5237",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Covering immigration . . . When you donâ€™t live near a border!",
  "description": "Tips for covering immigration stories for news outlets not located near a border.",
  "keywords": [
    "immigration",
    "reporting",
    "journalism",
    "news coverage"
  ]
}
```

I set the conference to "NICAR" since the input text mentioned "IRE 2017 - Phoenix", indicating it was presented at an IRE conference. The year is listed as "Not Listed" since a specific year was not given. The title and description are based on summarizing the input text. The keywords list some relevant terms related to the content. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON!
