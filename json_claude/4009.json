 Here is the JSON object for the text:

```json
{
  "id": "4009",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Nanci Wilson", "email": "nanciw@gmail.com", "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2013",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text provides investigative reporting tips and resources for journalists.",
  "keywords": ["investigative reporting", "resources", "tips", "journalism"]
}
```

I set the conference to "IRE" since it mentions the IRE conference in Oklahoma City in 2013. The year is listed as 2013 as well. The description summarizes the main focus of the text. And the keywords list relevant terms excluding the conference and authors.
