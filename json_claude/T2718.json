 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "T2718",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Eric Nalder",
      "email": "enalder@mercurynews.com",
      "affiliation": "Seattle Post-Intelligencer"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Breaking and Entering: How to dissect an organization",
  "description": "The article provides tips on investigating organizations by identifying key personnel, leaders, regulators and internal rules.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigation", 
    "organizations",
    "sources",
    "hierarchies",
    "rules"
  ]
}
```

I extracted the only listed author name, email and affiliation. Since no conference or year is mentioned, I put "Not Listed" for those fields. The description summarizes the main focus of the article, and the keywords list some topical terms related to investigating organizations.
