 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "3601",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Randy Ludlow",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Columbus Dispatch"
    },
    {
      "name": "Alan Miller", 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Columbus Dispatch"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Public access: Itâ€™s really quite simple",
  "description": "Tips for journalists on getting access to public records and meetings under open government laws.",
  "keywords": [
    "public records",
    "open meetings",
    "transparency",
    "access",
    "journalism"
  ]
}
```

I set the conference to "IRE" since the text mentions the Investigative Reporters and Editors organization. The year is "Not Listed" since a specific year for the conference/document is not given. The description summarizes the main focus of the tips, and the keywords capture some of the main topics covered without repeating terms used for other fields.
