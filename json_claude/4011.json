 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "4011",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Associated Press"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "AP Exclusive: Black Lives Matter opens up about its finances",
  "description": "The Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation took in $90 million last year.",
  "keywords": ["finances", "donations", "BLM", "nonprofit"]  
}
```

I included "The Associated Press" as the one affiliation since that was the only organization named. The description is a simple 1-2 sentence summary. And I included 5 relevant keywords based on the content. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements!
