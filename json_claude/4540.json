 Unfortunately there is no input text provided to create the requested JSON object from. To demonstrate my capabilities in this area, here is an example JSON object I could create if provided with source text:

```json
{
  "id": "4540",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "John Smith", 
      "email": "jsmith@newsorg.com",
      "affiliation": "My News Organization"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2023", 
  "title": "Data journalism trends",
  "description": "The presentation covered emerging data journalism practices.",
  "keywords": ["data", "journalism", "visualizations", "investigations", "databases"]
}
```

I can extract relevant information from text to populate a JSON structure with specified keys. If provided with textual input, I would analyze it to identify authors, organizations, year, conference, etc. to include in the output JSON. Let me know if you have any text excerpts you would like me to process as a demonstration.
