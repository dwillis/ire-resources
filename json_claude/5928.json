 Here is the JSON object generated from the input text:

```json
{
    "id": "5928",
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": "Scott Friedman", 
            "email": null,
            "affiliation": "NBC5 Dallas-Fort Worth"
        },
        {
            "name": "Diane Wilson",
            "email": null, 
            "affiliation": "ABC11" 
        },
        {
            "name": "Chris Henao",
            "email": null,
            "affiliation": "KSAT12-TV"
        }
    ],
    "conference": "IRE",
    "year": "Not Listed",
    "title": "Overcoming Obstacles",
    "description": "Tipsheet providing strategies for investigative journalists to overcome obstacles related to records requests, confrontations, legal issues, and uncooperative subjects.",
    "keywords": [
        "records",
        "confrontations",
        "legal",
        "delays",
        "threats"
    ]
}
```

I extracted the author names and affiliations where available. Since no email addresses were provided, I left those values as null. The conference was listed as "IRE". No specific year was given, so I put "Not Listed" for the year value. The description summarizes the overall content. And I selected 5 relevant keywords from the text.
