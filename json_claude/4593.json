 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
  "id": "4593",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Ernesto Rivera", "email": null, "affiliation": "La Nación"},
    {"name": "Giannina Segnini", "email": null, "affiliation": "La Nación"}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Subvaluation of lands of all ministers adds up to 11,000 million colones",
  "description": "An investigation by La Nación revealed that ministers and their spouses had properties undervalued, paying less taxes than they should.",
  "keywords": ["taxes", "properties", "investigation", "ministers"] 
}
```

I included the key details from the text like the author names and affiliation, did not make up any additional data, summarized the main findings of the investigation, and listed relevant keywords. The conference and year were marked as "Not Listed" since that information did not appear in the provided text. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON object!
