 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
   "id": 4017,
   "authors": [
      {
         "name": "Michael J. Berens", 
         "email": "mberens@seattletimes.com",
         "affiliation": "The Seattle Times"
      }
   ],
   "conference": "NICAR",
   "year": "Not Listed",
   "title": "Source Types",
   "description": "The author describes 10 common types of news sources and strategies for building relationships with them.",
   "keywords": [
      "sources",
      "journalism",
      "reporting",
      "interviewing"
   ]
}
```

I included the one author name that was listed along with his email and affiliation. The conference and year were not clearly identified, so I put "Not Listed" for those. The description summarizes the main point of the text, and the keywords list a few relevant terms related to the content. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON!
