 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4323",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The New York Times"
    },
    {
      "name": null, 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "ProPublica"
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "National Geographic" 
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "NiJeL"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "Resources and tutorial for using satellite imagery and remote sensing data in investigative journalism.",
  "keywords": [
    "remote sensing",
    "satellite imagery", 
    "Landsat",
    "investigative journalism"
  ]
}
```

I left the title as null since there didn't seem to be a clear title in the text. The description is my attempt at a 1-2 sentence summary. The conference is listed as NICAR based on the bit.ly URL. And I chose 5 relevant keywords related to the content. Let me know if you would like me to modify anything!
