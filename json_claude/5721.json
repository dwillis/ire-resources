 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5721",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Katrice Hardy", "email": "khardy1@greenvillenews.com", "affiliation": "Greenville News"},
    {"name": "R.G. Dunlop", "email": "rdunlop@louisvillepublicmedia.org", "affiliation": "Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting"},
    {"name": "Phil Williams", "email": "phil.williams@newschannel5.com", "affiliation": "News Channel 5 Nashville"}
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "IRE Tipsheet",
  "description": "Tips for investigative journalists to build on success after publication and avoid common pitfalls.",
  "keywords": ["sources", "impact", "reception", "social media", "accuracy"]  
}
```

I extracted the author names, emails, and affiliations from the sign-off section at the end. Since no year was listed, I put "Not Listed" for the year key. The description summarizes the main focus of the tips, and the keywords highlight some of the main topics covered without the authors or conference.
