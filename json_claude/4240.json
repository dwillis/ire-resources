 Here is the JSON object based on the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4240",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Ben Poston", "email": null, "affiliation": "Los Angeles Times"},
    {"name": "Steve Thompson", "email": null, "affiliation": "Dallas Morning News"}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Compstat USA",
  "description": "A revolutionary policing model led to unintended consequences.",
  "keywords": ["Compstat", "crime statistics", "police", "data"]  
}
```

I included the most prominent authors and their media affiliations. Since a conference and year were not clearly identified, I put "NICAR" for the conference and "Not Listed" for the year. The description summarizes the main point concisely, and the keywords capture some of the main topics, excluding the conference and authors.
