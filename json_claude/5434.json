 Here is the JSON object created from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "5434",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Bloomberg Business"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": "SENSOR JOURNALISM IN THE AGE OF TRUMPâ€™S EPA",
  "description": "The text discusses the Trump administration's efforts to roll back environmental regulations and remove climate change information from government websites.",
  "keywords": [
    "air pollution", 
    "regulations",
    "climate change",
    "journalism",
    "sensors"
  ]
}
```

I included "Bloomberg Business" as the one affiliation since they were the source of some of the text. The rest of the information like authors, conference, and year was not clearly provided, so I put "Not Listed" or null values. The description is a concise 1-2 sentence summary, and keywords cover some of the main topics without duplicating the conference or authors.
