 Unfortunately there is no input text provided to extract information from. Based on the instructions, here is an example JSON object I could create:

{
  "id": "5315",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": []
}

Please provide the input text you would like me to extract information from and I would be happy to create the JSON object based on that. Without any input text I have populated the JSON with null or default values as placeholders according to the instructions.
