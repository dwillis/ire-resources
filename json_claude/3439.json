 Here is the JSON object for Tipsheet #3439:

```json
{
  "id": "3439",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Mark Caramanica",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "FOIA Tip Sheet",
  "description": "Tipsheet providing guidance on making effective Freedom of Information Act requests to U.S. federal agencies.",
  "keywords": [
    "FOIA",
    "freedom of information", 
    "public records",
    "reporting",
    "access"
  ] 
}
```

I included the key information from the tipsheet like the id, title, author name and affiliation, left conference and year as "Not Listed" since those details were not provided, summarized the content in the description, and listed relevant keywords. Let me know if you need any changes to this JSON object!
