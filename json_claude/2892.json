 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
    "id": "2892",
    "authors": [
        {"name": "Seth Borenstein", "email": "sborenstein@ap.org", "affiliation": "Associated Press"}, 
        {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "Knight Ridder Newspapers"}
    ],
    "conference": "NICAR", 
    "year": "Not Listed",
    "title": "How to investigate workplace safety", 
    "description": "A journalist discusses methods for investigating mining accidents and lax enforcement of US mining safety regulations under the Bush administration.",
    "keywords": ["mining", "workplace safety", "enforcement", "statistics", "data"]
}
```

I extracted the one clear author name and contact info, left the other authors as null since no names were provided, used the conference and year info provided, summarized the text, and listed 5 relevant keywords. Let me know if you need any clarification or changes to this JSON structure.
