 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "T2652",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Nils Mulvad",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "DICAR â€“ Danish International Center for Analytical Reporting"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "CAR",
  "year": "2006",
  "title": "Farming subsidies is key to investigate fraud in EU",
  "description": "The text discusses using data on EU farming subsidies to investigate fraud and misuse across European countries.",
  "keywords": [
    "farming",
    "subsidies",
    "fraud",
    "investigate",
    "EU"
  ]
}
```

I extracted the author name, conference name and year from the text. The affiliation for the author was also present. Since no email was provided, I set that to null. The description is a short 1-2 sentence summary, and the keywords list contains 5 relevant terms excluding conference and authors.
