 Unfortunately I do not have enough context to fully construct the JSON object you described. Since you did not provide any input text, I do not know the title, authors, description, etc. to include. 

However, here is an example JSON object with the structure you specified, using placeholder values:

```json
{
  "id": 4629,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "John Smith",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "New York Times"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2023,
  "title": "Example article title",
  "description": "A brief 1-2 sentence summary of the example article",
  "keywords": [
    "journalism",
    "investigation",
    "data" 
  ]
}
```

If you provide the actual text you would like summarized and converted to JSON, I would be happy to try generating the full JSON object. Please let me know if you have any other questions!
