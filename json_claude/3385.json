 Here is the JSON object for the text:

```json
{
  "id": "3385",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Greg Borowski",
      "email": "gborowski@journalsentinel.com",
      "affiliation": "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel"
    },
    {
      "name": "Suki Dardarian", 
      "email": "sdardarian@seattletimes.com",
      "affiliation": "The Seattle Times"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2010",
  "title": "INVESTIGATIVE BREAKING NEWS TIPSHEET",
  "description": "Tipsheet with advice for investigative journalists on preparing for, covering, and following up on breaking news stories.",
  "keywords": [
    "breaking news",
    "investigations",
    "journalism",
    "tips",
    "planning"
  ]
}
```

I parsed the key information from the text to populate the JSON object with the requested structure and attributes. The description summarizes the overall purpose, the conference and year are taken directly, and I selected 5 relevant keywords. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON.
