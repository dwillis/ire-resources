 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the text:

{
   "id":"3145",
   "authors":[
      {
         "name":null,
         "email":null,
         "affiliation":"IRE"
      }
   ],
   "conference":"NICAR",
   "year":"Not Listed",
   "title":"Mining the Web for Data, Part II",
   "description":"This class teaches how to scrape complex websites by automating navigation and form submission.",
   "keywords":[
      "web scraping",
      "Perl",
      "automation"
   ]
}

I left the author name as null since none was listed. The text mentions NICAR so I used that as the conference. No year was listed so I put "Not Listed". The description summarizes the key points. And I chose some relevant keywords related to the topics covered. Let me know if you would like me to modify anything!
