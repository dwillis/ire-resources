 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

{
    "id": "T1892",
    "authors": [
        {"name": "Fernando Rodrigues", "email": null, "affiliation": "Folha de S.Paulo"}
    ],
    "conference": "Global Investigative Journalism Conference", 
    "year": "2003",
    "title": "After the death of a journalist: the stories to do; the work to finish",
    "description": "The speech discusses attacks against journalists around the world and argues that investigative journalists must continue pursuing stories even when colleagues are killed.",
    "keywords": ["deaths", "attacks", "investigative journalism", "organized crime"]
}
