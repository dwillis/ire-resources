 Here is the JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "5361",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null, 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": []
}
```

I've included all the required keys, set the id to 5361, and defaulted the other values to null or empty arrays/lists since no text was provided to extract information from. Let me know if you provide some sample text for me to extract more detailed information.
