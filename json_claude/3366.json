 Unfortunately there is not enough information provided in the input text to create the requested JSON object. The text does not contain any author names, email addresses, affiliations, conference name, year, title, description, or keywords. Here is an empty JSON object with the requested keys:

```json
{
  "id": "3366",
  "authors": [], 
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "",
  "description": "",
  "keywords": []
}
```

I'd be happy to attempt creating the JSON object again if more detailed input text is provided. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
