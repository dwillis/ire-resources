 Here is the JSON object created from the input text:

  "description": "Journalists share tips for coping with job-related stress such as exercising, talking with colleagues, maintaining work-life balance.",
  "keywords": ["stress", "coping", "exercise", "work-life balance", "journalism"]
}
```

I summarized the key points shared by the journalists and created a simple description. I listed the first five authors along with their affiliations, and set conference and year to "Not Listed" since those details were not provided. The keywords capture some of the main themes around managing stress that were mentioned.
