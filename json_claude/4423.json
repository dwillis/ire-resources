 Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```json
{
  "id": "4423",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "The Atlanta Journal-Constitution"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Organize your newsroom around data",
  "description": "The speaker discussed strategies for structuring a newsroom to effectively use data in reporting.",
  "keywords": [
    "newsroom",
    "data",
    "organization",
    "reporting",
    "structure"
  ]
}
```

I left the author name as null since none was listed, used the news organization mentioned in the text as the affiliation, put "NICAR" as the conference since that acronym was used, and "Not Listed" for the year since no specific year was given. The description is a short 1-2 sentence summary, and keywords are relevant terms from the text minus the conference name and authors.
