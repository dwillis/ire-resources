 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

  "keywords": [
    "data journalism",
    "training", 
    "newsrooms",
    "projects",
    "visualization"
  ]
}
```

I set the conference to NICAR since it was referenced, but did not see a clear year listed. The description summarizes the overall discussion, and keywords capture some of the main topics covered.
