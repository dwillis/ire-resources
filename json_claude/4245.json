 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": 4245,
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Mark Schoofs", "email": null, "affiliation": "BuzzFeed"},
    {"name": "Blake Morrison", "email": null, "affiliation": "Reuters"}, 
    {"name": "Patricia DiCarlo", "email": null, "affiliation": "CNN"},
    {"name": "Maud Beelman", "email": null, "affiliation": "The Dallas Morning News"}
  ],
  "conference": "IRE", 
  "year": "2014",
  "title": "Bulletproofing",
  "description": "A panel discussion on anticipating challenges and managing blowback when investigating stories.",
  "keywords": ["investigations", "journalism", "reporting", "ethics", "scrutiny"] 
}
```

I included the author names that were listed, left email and affiliation null if not provided, used the news organization names as affiliations where possible, put "IRE" as the conference since that acronym is included, put 2014 as the year though it's not definitively stated, created a short description summary sentence, and listed 5 relevant keywords while avoiding repeating conference and author terms. Let me know if you would like me to modify anything!
