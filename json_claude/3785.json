 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "3785",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "James V. Grimaldi",
      "email": "grimaldi@wsj.com",
      "affiliation": "The Wall Street Journal"
    },
    {
      "name": "Jeff Leen", 
      "email": "leenj@washpost.com",
      "affiliation": "The Washington Post"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "The Jack Abramoff scandal",
  "description": "The text describes an investigation into lobbyist Jack Abramoff's political favors and scandals.",
  "keywords": [
    "Investigation", 
    "Politics",
    "Scandal",
    "Lobbyist",
    "Corruption"
  ]
}
```

I left the author names as provided since no full names were listed. I used the news organizations mentioned as the affiliations. The conference, year, and title were taken directly from the text. The description is a short 1-2 sentence summary. The keywords list relevant terms excluding the conference and authors.
