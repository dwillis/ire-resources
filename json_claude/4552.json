 Unfortunately there is not enough context in the input to create a valid JSON object with all the requested keys. The input does not contain clear information about the id, authors, conference, year, title, or description. Here is my best attempt at creating a partial JSON object based on the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "id": "4552",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": []
}
```

I included placeholder null values where information was missing or unclear. The id is set to 4552 as requested. The conference and year are listed as "Not Listed" since that information does not seem to be contained in the input text. The title, description, and keywords are left as null or empty arrays since there is no clear content to summarize. Please let me know if you have any other questions!
