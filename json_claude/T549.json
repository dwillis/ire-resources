 Unfortunately there is not enough information in the text to create a complete JSON object with all the requested keys. Here is my attempt based on the available details:

```json
{
  "id": "T549",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "Akron Beacon Journal"
    },
    {
      "name": null, 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "City Paper" 
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "In Pittsburgh"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text contains contact information for journalists and media organizations.",
  "keywords": [ 
    "journalists",
    "media", 
    "contact",
    "information"
  ] 
}
```

I left many values as null since names, titles, etc. were not provided. Please let me know if you would like me to attempt creating more meaningful values from the limited information.
