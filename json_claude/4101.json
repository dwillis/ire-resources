 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
  "id": "4101",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null  
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Finding data from other countries",
  "description": "This tipsheet provides guidance on finding publicly available data sets from other countries, using search engines and data portals.",
  "keywords": [
    "data",
    "search tips",
    "international",
    "datasets"
  ] 
}
```

I did not include any author names, emails or affiliations since none were listed in the text. The conference and year are listed as "Not Listed" since those details were also not provided. The description is a 1-2 sentence summary, and the keywords list relevant terms excluding the conference and authors.
