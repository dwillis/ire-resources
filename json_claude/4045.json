 Unfortunately I do not have access to the full text that was provided to summarize and extract keywords from. Based on the limited information in your instructions, here is an attempt at creating the requested JSON object:

{
  "id": "4045",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "No text was provided to summarize.",
  "keywords": [] 
}

I've included the requested structure and keys, but without any text I cannot accurately populate most of the values, such as authors, affiliation, description, title or keywords. Please provide the full text and I would be happy to generate an appropriate summary and keywords.
