 Here is the JSON object generated from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "3840",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The New York Times"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "FOIA Machine",
  "description": "FOIA Machine is an open source platform to help citizens and journalists file and track Freedom of Information Act requests.",
  "keywords": [
    "FOIA", 
    "open source",
    "platform",
    "requests",
    "journalists"
  ]
}
```

I included "The New York Times" as the affiliation since the text mentioned it as a news organization. The conference was listed as NICAR. The year was not clearly identified, so I put "Not Listed". The description is a 1-2 sentence summary of the main points. The keywords list contains relevant terms from the text without the conference name or author information.
