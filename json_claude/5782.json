 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5782",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "Investigative Reporters & Editors"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2019",
  "title": "Favorite code snippets",
  "description": "A list of reusable code snippets for common data journalism tasks.",
  "keywords": ["code", "data", "journalism", "snippets"]
}
```

I included "IRE" as the conference since that was mentioned in the text. The year was listed as 2019. For the title, I used the title at the top of the document. For the description, I summarized the overall purpose of the document. And for keywords, I included relevant terms related to the content.
