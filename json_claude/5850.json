 Unfortunately I do not have access to the full text input you referenced, so I cannot create the exact JSON object you described. However, based on your instructions, here is an example of the structure the JSON object should have:

```json
{
  "id": "5850",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "New York Times"  
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "2022",
  "title": "How to Structure JSON Data",
  "description": "This text provides instructions for creating a JSON object from input text.",
  "keywords": ["json", "data", "structure"] 
}
```

The keys are the ones you specified - id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. I included some placeholder sample values to demonstrate the structure. Without any actual input text I cannot extract specific author names, emails, affiliations or an accurate description and keywords. But hopefully this gives you an idea of how the JSON should be formatted based on your criteria. Let me know if you have any other questions!
