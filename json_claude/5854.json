 Here is the JSON object created from the input:

```json
{
  "id": 5854,
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "California Healthline"},
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "Kaiser Health News"}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": "Readers And Tweeters Define ‘Affordable’ In Health Insurance",
  "description": "Readers and Tweeters discuss what they consider 'affordable' health insurance.",
  "keywords": ["health", "insurance", "affordable", "readers", "tweeters"]  
}
```

I set the id to 5854 as requested. The authors list contains two elements with null names since no author names were provided. The affiliations are set based on the news organizations mentioned. The conference and year are set to "Not Listed" since that information is not clearly identified in the text. The description is a short 1-2 sentence summary. And the keywords list contains 5 relevant terms, excluding the conference and authors info.
