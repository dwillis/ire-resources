 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "3677",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Jeff Porter",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "IRE and NICAR"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE and NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "How to use PDFTOTEXT to convert PDFs into text",
  "description": "This text provides instructions on how to install and use the PDFTOTEXT software to convert PDF files into formatted text that can be imported into Excel.",
  "keywords": [
    "pdftotext", 
    "pdf",
    "convert",
    "text",
    "excel",
    "import"
  ] 
}
```

I extracted the author name and conference affiliations for the authors field. Since no email or other affiliations were provided, I left those null. The conference, keywords, title and high-level description provide additional context. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON structure!
