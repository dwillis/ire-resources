 Here is the JSON object created from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5686",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "The Palm Beach Post"},
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "The Palm Beach Post"}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Tracking the opioid epidemic(s) using WONDER",
  "description": "The text discusses using the CDC's WONDER database to track opioid overdose deaths and spot trends.",
  "keywords": ["CDC", "WONDER", "databases", "opioids", "overdoses"] 
}
```

I left the author names as null since none were listed, used the news organizations mentioned as the affiliations, summarized the text, identified the conference as NICAR since that seems likely given the data journalism focus, and listed 5 relevant keywords. Let me know if you need any changes to this JSON.
