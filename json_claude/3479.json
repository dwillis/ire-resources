 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the text:

{
  "id": "3479",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "2011",
  "title": "Spatial Analysis on the Cheap",
  "description": "Tips for using free and open source software to conduct spatial analysis for stories.",
  "keywords": ["mapping", "data analysis", "software"]
}
