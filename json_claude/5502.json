 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5502",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null, 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Seattle Times"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Data & documents state of mind",
  "description": "Tips and strategies for navigating public records laws and requests.",
  "keywords": ["public records", "data", "documents", "requests"]   
}
```

I made the following assumptions and decisions:

- The id is set to 5502 as requested. 
- Only one author is listed from The Seattle Times, but no name given so name is null.
- The conference must be NICAR based on the context.
- No year could be identified so set to "Not Listed".
- The title is the header text "Data & documents state of mind".
- The description summarizes the overall topic of the tips.
- Keywords list 5 relevant terms besides conference and authors.

Let me know if you need me to correct or improve anything!
