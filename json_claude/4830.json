 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4830",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "Washington Post"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "How a janitor took down the Cashman Middle School molester",
  "description": "A janitor helped catch a teacher who molested students at Cashman Middle School.",
  "keywords": [
    "janitor",
    "middle school", 
    "molester",
    "students",
    "teacher"  
  ]
}
```

I included the Washington Post as the affiliation since it was mentioned in the text. The conference, year, and authors' name/email were left as "Not Listed" or null since that information was not provided. The description is a simple 1-2 sentence summary, and the keywords are relevant terms from the text, excluding the conference and authors.
