 Here is a possible JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
  "id": "4785",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "Associated Press"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "AP Exclusive: DEA agent accused of conspiring with cartel",
  "description": "A once-standout DEA agent has been accused of conspiring with a Mexican drug cartel.",
  "keywords": [
    "DEA",
    "agent", 
    "conspiracy",
    "cartel",
    "Mexico"
  ] 
}
```

I left the author name and email as null since none was listed. I used the Associated Press as the affiliation since it was mentioned in the text. The conference and year were listed as "Not Listed" since no conference was mentioned. The description is a short 1-2 sentence summary. Finally, the keywords list several relevant terms from the text.
