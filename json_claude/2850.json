 Unfortunately I do not have the full text to summarize. Based on the limited information provided, here is a sample JSON object I could create:

```json
{
  "id": "2850",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "No full text was provided to summarize into a 1-2 sentence description.",
  "keywords": [] 
}
```

I tried to follow the structure you specified, including:
- id of 2850
- authors array with name/email/affiliation attributes
- conference, year, title, description, and keywords keys
- Placeholder values for keys with no provided data
- Quotation marks around all keys and string values

If you provide the full text, I would be happy to summarize it and extract appropriate authors, conference, keywords, etc. Just let me know.
