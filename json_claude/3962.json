 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

{
  "id": "3962",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Julian Sher", "email": null, "affiliation": "Toronto Star"},
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Writing the investigative story",
  "description": "Scoops are reported, but stories are told.",
  "keywords": ["storytelling", "investigative reporting", "writing"]  
}

I set the conference to NICAR since the text mentioned being an investigative reporter. The year was not listed so I set that to "Not Listed". For the description I used a quote from the text that seemed to summarize the main point. And for keywords I picked out some terms related to the topics covered without repeating information already captured.
