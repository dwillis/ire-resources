 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

{
    "id": "4959",
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": null,
            "email": null, 
            "affiliation": "Associated Press"
        }
    ],
    "conference": "NICAR 17",
    "year": "Not Listed",
    "title": "Practical data viz in Javascript",
    "description": "This presentation covers practical techniques for creating basic data visualizations like bar charts and tables using jQuery and other Javascript libraries.",
    "keywords": [
        "dataviz",
        "Javascript", 
        "jQuery", 
        "charts", 
        "tables"
    ]
}

I left the author name as null since none was listed. I used "Associated Press" as the affiliation based on it being mentioned in the text. The conference is listed as "NICAR 17". The year is "Not Listed" since a specific year was not given. The description is a 1-2 sentence summary of the main topics covered. And the keywords list contains relevant terms related to the content.
