 Here is the JSON object based on the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4645",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Charles Ornstein", "email": null, "affiliation": "ProPublica"},
    {"name": "Ryann Grochowski Jones", "email": null, "affiliation": "ProPublica"}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "2016",
  "title": "Hands on with health data",
  "description": "Tipsheet for a NICAR 2016 hands on session working with Medicare and Medicaid data in Excel using pivot tables, sorting, filtering and VLOOKUP.",
  "keywords": ["Medicare", "Medicaid", "data", "Excel", "health"]
}
```

I extracted the author names and their affiliation with ProPublica. Since no email addresses were listed, I left email as null. The conference is listed as NICAR, and the year 2016 is clearly identified. The description is a 1-2 sentence summary, and the keywords list relevant terms excluding the conference and authors.
