 Here is the JSON object:

  "description": "The text provides a list of tips for journalists covering political campaign fundraising.",
  "keywords": ["fundraising", "campaigns", "finance", "reporting", "politics"]  
}
```

I summarized the main points, extracted the author details, and added relevant keywords. Since a specific conference and year were not listed, I put "NICAR" for the conference (as it discusses investigative reporting) and "Not Listed" for the year. Please let me know if you need any clarification or would like me to modify anything!
