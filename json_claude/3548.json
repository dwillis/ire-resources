 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": 3548,
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Joel Grover", "email": null, "affiliation": "KNBC, Los Angeles"},
    {"name": "Cindy Galli", "email": null, "affiliation": "Inside Edition"},
    {"name": "Angela Hill", "email": null, "affiliation": "ABC News"},
    {"name": "Andy Siegel", "email": null, "affiliation": "CBS Law"}
  ],
  "conference": "IRE", 
  "year": "2011",
  "title": "Pulling off the Undercover Investigation",
  "description": "Tips for journalists on strategically and ethically conducting undercover investigations using hidden cameras.",
  "keywords": ["undercover", "investigation", "hidden camera", "ethics"] 
}
```

I included the conference name, year, and author names from the first line. For the description, I summarized the key points about planning and conducting an ethical undercover investigation. The keywords list some of the main topics covered without repeating terms used in other fields.
