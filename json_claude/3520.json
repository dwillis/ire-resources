 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "3520",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Meg Kissinger", "email": null, "affiliation": "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel"}, 
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "Tips from Meg Kissinger for investigating issues with caregivers for vulnerable people.",
  "keywords": ["investigating", "caregivers", "legal notices", "secrecy", "whistleblowers", "salaries"] 
}
```

I included the key details from the text - the author name and affiliation, summarized the overall content in the description, noted that no specific conference or year was listed, and extracted a few concise keywords. The other keys are populated with default null or "Not Listed" values as specified in the instructions.
