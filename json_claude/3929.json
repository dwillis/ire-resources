 Unfortunately there is not enough information provided in the text to construct the requested JSON object. The text does not contain any author names, email addresses, affiliations, conference name, year, title, description, or keywords. Here is an attempt at constructing a partial JSON object based on the information provided:

```json
{
  "id": "3929",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": [] 
}
```

I've included the requested keys and set most values to null or empty arrays/lists since no supporting details were available. The id is set to 3929 and the conference is listed as "Not Listed" per the instructions. Please let me know if you have any other text or context that could be used to populate a more complete JSON object.
