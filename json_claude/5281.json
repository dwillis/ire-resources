 Here is the JSON object for the text:

```json
{
  "id": "5281",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Jon Craig",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Starting over: When you move to a new market",
  "description": "Tips for investigative journalists moving to a new media market, including protecting values, requesting records, developing sources, and handling pushback.",
  "keywords": [
    "Journalism", 
    "Investigative",
    "Records",
    "Sources",
    "Tips"
  ]
}
```

I included the author's name since it was provided, left email and affiliation null since those details were not included. The conference is listed as IRE based on the text. The year is unspecified so I put "Not Listed". The description summarizes the main points, and the keywords highlight some of the main topics covered without repeating the conference or author terms.
