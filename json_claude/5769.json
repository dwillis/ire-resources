 Here is the JSON object based on the instructions:

```json

      "affiliation": "The Associated Press"
    },

      "email": null,

    },
    {

    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",

  "keywords": [
    "data",
    "libraries",
    "newsrooms",
    "resources",
    "management"
  ]
}
```

I included the affiliations that were mentioned in the text, used a simple description sentence, and selected some relevant keywords about the topic. Let me know if you need any changes to this JSON object!
