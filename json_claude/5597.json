 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "5597",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Washington Post"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2019",
  "title": "Prying Loose Public Records",
  "description": "A presentation providing tips and strategies for filing and litigating public records requests under FOIA and state public records laws.",
  "keywords": [
    "FOIA",
    "public records", 
    "transparency",
    "litigation",
    "tips"
  ]
}
```

I extracted the conference name, year, and author affiliation from the text. Since no author name was provided, I left that null. The description is a 1-2 sentence summary, and I included 5 relevant keywords. Let me know if you need me to modify anything!
