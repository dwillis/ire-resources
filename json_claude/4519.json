 Here is the JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": 4519,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Julia Angwin", 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2015,
  "title": "Avoiding Prying Eyes", 
  "description": "This tipsheet provides strategies and tools for journalists to protect their sources and communications from surveillance.",
  "keywords": ["security", "privacy", "encryption", "anonymity", "tips"]
}
```

I extracted the conference name and year from the first paragraph. The author name was listed, but no other author details. The description summarizes the main purpose of the text. For keywords I focused on the main themes related to source protection.
