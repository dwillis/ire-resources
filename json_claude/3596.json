 Here is the JSON object created from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "3596",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Ryan McNeill", "email": null, "affiliation": "The Dallas Morning News"},
    {"name": "Cynthia O'Murchu", "email": null, "affiliation": "Financial Times"}
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2011",
  "title": null,
  "description": "Tipsheet from a 2011 IRE conference providing an overview and recommendations on web scraping tools and techniques for journalists.",
  "keywords": ["scraping", "tools", "techniques", "PDF", "programming"] 
}
```

I included the top-level conference name as the conference value, left the title null since there wasn't one provided, and summarized the content in the description. For authors, I included the two names listed along with their affiliations, leaving email null. And I selected 5 representative keywords from the content.
