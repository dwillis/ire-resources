 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5310",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Marshall Project"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2017",
  "title": "Tools Presented at the Oct. 14 IRE Watchdog Workshop in Portland, Maine",
  "description": "The text lists over 30 free tools for journalists to use for tasks like monitoring websites, extracting data, visualizing data, and analyzing data with R.",
  "keywords": [
    "tools", 
    "data",
    "journalism",
    "visualization",
    "R"
  ]
}
```

To summarize the key details:

- The id is set to 5310
- The author name is null since none is listed, email and affiliation are from The Marshall Project mentioned in the text
- The conference is IRE based on the workshop details
- The year is 2017 from the date of the workshop  
- The title and description are direct summaries of the content
- Keywords list some of the main topics covered

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON!
