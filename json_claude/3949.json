 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "3949",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Bloomberg News"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "\"Tracking Government Contracts\"",
  "description": "The text discusses searching public records to find details on government contracts in the U.S., including tips on where to look for competitive bids and non-competitive justifications.",
  "keywords": [
    "government", 
    "contracts",
    "records",
    "search",
    "tips"
  ]
}
```

I left the author name and email null since those details were not provided. The affiliation is Bloomberg News based on the email address. The conference is NICAR based on context. The year is not clearly stated, so I put "Not Listed". The description summarizes the key points, and the keywords highlight useful search terms relevant to the content.
