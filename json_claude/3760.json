 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
   "id": "3760",
   "authors": [
      {"name": "Craig Harris", "email": null, "affiliation": "The Arizona Republic"},
      {"name": "Steve Doig", "email": null, "affiliation": "Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication"},
      {"name": "David Milstead", "email": null, "affiliation": null},
      {"name": "Jo Anne Bourquard", "email": null, "affiliation": "National Conference of State Legislatures"},
      {"name": "Lynn Turner", "email": null, "affiliation": null}, 
      {"name": "Kil Huh", "email": null, "affiliation": "Pew Center on the States"},
      {"name": "Chester Spratt", "email": null, "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon Universityâ€™s Tepper School of Business"}
   ],
   "conference": "Not Listed",
   "year": "Not Listed",
   "title": null,
   "description": "A list of experts and resources for reporting on public pensions.",
   "keywords": ["pensions", "experts", "reporting", "journalism", "finance"]
}
```

I included all the named individuals as authors along with their affiliations if listed. The conference, year, and title were not applicable. The description summarizes the overall purpose, and keywords capture some of the main topics. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON structure!
