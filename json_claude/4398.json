 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4398",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Matt Waite", "email": null, "affiliation": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln"}, 
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2013",
  "title": "The TSA-a-tron",
  "description": "The author describes making a custom accelerometer to track impacts on luggage during air travel.",
  "keywords": ["luggage", "sensor", "accelerometer", "impacts", "travel"]
}
```

I made assumptions where details were missing, like leaving email and affiliation null for the second author, and summarizing the text into a short description sentence. The conference is NICAR based on the title slide, and the year 2013 comes from the same source. The keywords list contains relevant terms from the content.
