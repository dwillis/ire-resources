 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "5379",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null, 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Seattle Times"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "How The Seattle Times analyzed COVID exposure notifications to find disproportionate impacts",
  "description": "The Seattle Times analyzed COVID exposure notification data to find disproportionate impacts.",
  "keywords": ["COVID", "analysis", "notifications", "impacts", "data"]  
}
```

I left the author name as null since none was provided. I used "The Seattle Times" as the affiliation since that was the only organization listed. The conference is NICAR based on the text. No year was provided so I put "Not Listed". The description is a 1-2 sentence summary, and I included 5 relevant keywords from the content. Let me know if you need any clarification or have suggestions for improvement!
