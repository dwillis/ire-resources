 Here is the JSON object based on the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4964",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "ProPublica"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Finding, Developing and Keeping Sources",
  "description": "The text discusses tips for journalists on finding sources for stories, building relationships with them, and maintaining contact over time.",
  "keywords": [
    "sourcing",
    "research",
    "interviewing",
    "journalism",
    "reporting"
  ]
}
```

I left the author name, email, and affiliation mostly blank since no specific author details were provided. The conference and year were labeled "Not Listed" since no conference or date details were given. The description summarizes the main topics covered, and the keywords list the main themes. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON!
