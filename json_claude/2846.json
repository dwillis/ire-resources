 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "2846",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Pioneer Press"
    },
    {
       "name": null,
       "email": null,
       "affiliation": "washingtonpost.com" 
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "2007",
  "title": "Wiki Panel Handout and Notes",
  "description": "This is a handout providing information and advice on using wikis in newsrooms.",
  "keywords": ["wikis", "newsrooms", "organization", "efficiency", "sharing"] 
}
```

I set the conference based on it being mentioned in the text, the year as 2007 since that year is mentioned, and created a short description summarizing the overall purpose of the text. I included some relevant keywords related to the uses and benefits of wikis as described. The authors are listed as null since no specific author names were given, but their affiliations were included.
