 Here is the JSON object created from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "5301",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "ProPublica"
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting" 
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "BULLETPROOFING YOUR REPORTING",
  "description": "The authors provide tips on ensuring accurate and reproducible data analysis and reporting.",
  "keywords": [
    "data",
    "analysis",
    "reporting",
    "accuracy",
    "reproducibility"
  ]
}
```

I extracted the authors' affiliations from the text, set the conference to NICAR since that was mentioned, left the year as "Not Listed" since no specific year was given, summarized the main points in the description, and listed some relevant keywords. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON!
