 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "4705",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "TVNewsJamie & @kcrowebasspro"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text discusses ideas for data journalism projects related to infrastructure issues like potholes, water main breaks, and taxation.",
  "keywords": [
    "infrastructure", 
    "potholes",
    "taxes",
    "data projects"
  ]
}
```

I left the name, email, and affiliation null for the authors since no specific names were provided. The conference and year are "Not Listed" since that information was not clearly provided. The description summarizes the key points in 1-2 sentences. The keywords list covers some of the main topics without repeating the conference or authors.
