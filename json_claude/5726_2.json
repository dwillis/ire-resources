 Unfortunately I do not have access to the full text that was provided with the original instructions. Based on the information given, here is an attempt at creating the requested JSON object:

{
  "id": "5726_2",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null 
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": []
}

I have included the requested keys with default values where details were not provided. The id is set to 5726_2. The authors array has a single element with null values since no author details were given. The conference and year are listed as "Not Listed" since those details were not provided. The title, description, and keywords arrays are left null or empty.

If more details from the original text are provided, I would be happy to update the JSON object accordingly. Please let me know if you need any clarification or changes to this attempt at fulfilling the instructions given the limited information provided.
