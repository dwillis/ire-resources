 Here is the JSON object for the text:

```json
{
  "id": "3495",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Martin Rosenbaum",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "BBC News"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": "Digging for Data in the UK",
  "description": "Tips for using the UK Freedom of Information Act to get data from over 100,000 public authorities.",
  "keywords": [
    "Freedom of Information", 
    "UK",
    "public data",
    "investigative reporting",
    "FOI requests"
  ] 
}
```

I extracted the author name and affiliation from the text. Since no email was provided, I left that null. The conference, year, and title were not clearly identified, so I used the default values. The description summarizes the main point, and the keywords list some relevant terms.
