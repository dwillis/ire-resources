 Here is the JSON object for the text:

```json
{
  "id": "T2060",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Stephen Kline",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "WOAI-San Antonio"
    },
    {
      "name": "Bryan Staples",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "WTVF-Nashville" 
    },
    {
      "name": "Kristin Stinar",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "KSTP-Minneapolis"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Broadcast skills: Shooting and editing the story",
  "description": "Tips for making compelling videos to accompany data-driven investigative stories.",
  "keywords": [
    "video",
    "graphics",
    "pacing",
    "lighting", 
    "editing"
  ]
}
```

I extracted the author names, emails, and affiliations from the sign-offs provided. Since no conference or year was listed, I put "Not Listed" for those fields. The description summarizes the overall content, and the keywords list some of the main video and editing concepts covered without duplicates from the defined fields.
