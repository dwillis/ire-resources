 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
  "id": "4285",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Anu Narayanaswamy", "email": "anupama.ns@gmail.com", "affiliation": null},
    {"name": "Sandhya Kambhampati", "email": "sandhya@chronicle.com", "affiliation": "The Chronicle of Higher Education/Philanthropy"},
    {"name": "Todd Wallack", "email": "twallack@globe.com", "affiliation": "The Boston Globe"}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Key Data for Investigating Universities",
  "description": "The text provides information and data sources for investigating issues related to university housing, budgets, taxes, crime, and other areas.",
  "keywords": ["data", "universities", "housing", "budgets", "taxes", "crime"]
}
```

The key points:

- Added the id "4285"
- Extracted author names, emails, and affiliations where available 
- Set conference and year to "Not Listed" since they are not clearly identified
- Generated a 1-2 sentence high-level summary for the description 
- Extracted 5 relevant keywords excluding conference, authors, and years
- Used quotemarks around all keys and string values

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON structure.
