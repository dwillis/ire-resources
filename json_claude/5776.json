 Here is the JSON object for the given input:

```json
{
  "id": "5776",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ)"},
    {"name": "Emilia DÃ­az-Struck", "email": null, "affiliation": null},
    {"name": "Margot Williams", "email": null, "affiliation": null},
    {"name": "Karrie Kehoe", "email": null, "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "The Implant Files",
  "description": "The article discusses issues with medical devices, including lack of testing, devices remaining on the market despite safety concerns, and challenges identifying hazardous implants.",
  "keywords": ["medical devices", "safety", "regulations", "injuries", "recalls"]
}
```

I included the key information from the input - the article title, the authors, a short 2 sentence summary description, and a few relevant keywords. Since no conference or year was listed, I put "Not Listed" for those values. The authors did not have additional info like emails or affiliations listed, so I left those as null where applicable.
