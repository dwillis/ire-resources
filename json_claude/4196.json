 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4196",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Lauren Sommer",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "KQED Public Radio"
    },
    {
      "name": "Matt Weiser",
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "The Sacramento Bee"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2014",
  "title": "The Parched West: Covering Water and Drought",
  "description": "Tipsheet providing background and suggestions for reporting on western U.S. water issues and drought.",
  "keywords": [
    "water",
    "drought",
    "west",
    "resources",
    "data"
  ]
}
```

I extracted the author names and affiliations from the bylines provided. Since no email addresses were given, I left those values as null. The conference is "IRE" based on the source. The year 2014 comes from the date. The title and description summarize the content. And I selected 5 relevant keywords from the text.
