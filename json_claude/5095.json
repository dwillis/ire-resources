 Unfortunately I do not have the full text to analyze. Based on the information provided, here is a partial JSON object I can generate:

```
{
  "id": 5095,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": []
}
```

I would need the full text input in order to extract additional details like author names, conference name, year, title, a description summary, and keywords. Please provide the full text you would like analyzed and turned into a JSON object, and I'm happy to try generating a more complete output.
