 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "T2530",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Robert Gebeloff", "email": null, "affiliation": "NICAR"}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "2005",
  "title": "Hidden Disparities",
  "description": "Story examines how outdated property tax assessments in New Jersey towns lead to racial inequities in tax bills.",
  "keywords": ["taxes", "assessments", "inequity", "race"]  
}
```

I included Robert Gebeloff as the only listed author, with NICAR as his affiliation since the text mentions this is from NICAR 2005. The conference is listed as NICAR and the year as 2005. The description summarizes the key point of racial inequity in tax assessments. The keywords list some relevant terms from the text.
