 Unfortunately I do not have access to the full text that was provided as input, so I cannot create the detailed JSON object as requested. From the information in your instructions, it seems you wanted me to extract information like author names, email addresses, conference names, etc. and structure it into a predefined JSON format. Without the actual text to analyze, I cannot reliably populate those fields. Please provide the full original text, and I would be happy to parse it into the requested JSON format with id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords to the best of my ability based on what information is present. Let me know if you can supply the source text or clarify what input I should be working with.
