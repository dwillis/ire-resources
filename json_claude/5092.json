 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5092",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Local incentive reporting",
  "description": "The text provides tips for investigating and reporting on local economic incentives, including building relationships, requesting records, and getting companies to talk.",
  "keywords": [
    "incentives",
    "economic development",
    "reporting",
    "records",
    "interviews"
  ]
}
```

I left the authors array empty since no author names were provided. The conference, year, and affiliation are listed as "Not Listed" since those details were not clearly identified in the text. The description summarizes the key points, and the keywords list includes relevant topical terms.
