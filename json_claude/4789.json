 Here is the JSON object created from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4789",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null, 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "USA TODAY"
    },
    {
      "name": "Jodi Upton",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "USA TODAY"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Bulletproofing the story",
  "description": "A journalist shared tips on verifying data and documents to ensure accurate reporting.",
  "keywords": [
    "data",
    "documents",
    "verification",
    "accuracy",
    "reporting"
  ]
}
```

I set the conference to NICAR since the text mentioned that conference, the year is "Not Listed" since no specific year was given. The description summarizes the main point. And the keywords list relevant terms related to the content. Let me know if you need me to modify anything!
