 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the text:

```json
{
  "id": "5226",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Chris Baxter", "email": null, "affiliation": "NJ Advance Media"},
    {"name": "Jeff Ernsthausen", "email": null, "affiliation": "Atlanta Journal Constitution"}, 
    {"name": "Melissa Lewis", "email": null, "affiliation": "The Oregonian"}
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Steal Our Data",
  "description": "Journalists share national datasets they built and explain how to localize the information.",
  "keywords": ["data", "investigation", "journalism", "datasets"]
}
```

I summarized the key points about sharing and localizing national datasets into a short description. I included the three listed panelists as the authors along with their affiliations. The conference is clearly IRE but no year is listed, so I put "Not Listed" there. The keywords cover some of the main topics without going over 5 terms. Let me know if you would like me to modify or improve anything!
