 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

{
    "id": "3282",
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": null,
            "email": null, 
            "affiliation": "Investigative Reporters and Editors, Inc."
        }
    ],
    "conference": "NICAR", 
    "year": "2009",
    "title": "CAR Stow Ideas",
    "description": "The text provides story ideas and data sources journalists can use to investigate government spending and oversight issues in their communities.",
    "keywords": [
        "government", "spending", "investigation", "journalism", "data"
    ]
}
