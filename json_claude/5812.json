 Here is the JSON object for the input:

```json
{
  "id": "5812",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Washington Post"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2019",
  "title": "Breaking out of the traditional election-cycle narrative",
  "description": "The presenters discussed using campaign finance data outside of election cycles to uncover influence and relationships.",
  "keywords": [
    "campaign finance", 
    "expenditures", 
    "lobbying", 
    "donors",
    "relationships"
  ]
}
```

I included The Washington Post as the affiliation since the URLs are from washingtonpost.com. The description summarizes the main points covered in the presentation. The keywords highlight some of the key themes around using campaign finance data over time.
