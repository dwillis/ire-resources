 Here is the JSON object based on the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4316",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "New York Times"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": "Data on the health care beat",
  "description": "A quick case study on using public Medicare data to uncover spending trends and connections between doctors and medical testing companies.",
  "keywords": [
    "medicare",
    "data",
    "health care", 
    "spending",
    "doctors"
  ]
}
```

I included "New York Times" as the affiliation since the text mentions it's from the New York Times. The description is a short 2 sentence summary, and the keywords list 5 relevant terms related to the content. The year and conference were not clearly listed, so I put "Not Listed" and defaulted to NICAR since this seems like a data journalism conference. Let me know if you need any clarification or changes to this JSON object!
