I included the station affiliation for Tisha Thompson since she is a reporter for WRC-TV. The conference, year, and some author details were not provided so I listed them as "Not Listed" or null. The description is a short summary of the main topics covered in the text. The keywords capture some of the main themes without duplicates.
