 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

{
  "id": "4183",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "IRE & INN"}, 
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "IRE & NICAR"}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Geocoding!",
  "description": "The text introduces geocoding, which is the process of taking address data and converting it into latitude and longitude coordinates so it can be placed accurately on a map.",
  "keywords": ["geocoding", "maps", "data", "addresses", "locations"]  
}
