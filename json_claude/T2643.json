 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
    "id": "T2643",
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": "Dave Sheingold",
            "email": null,
            "affiliation": "The Record"
        }
    ],
    "conference": "Not Listed",
    "year": "Not Listed",
    "title": "Image Mapper facts and tips",
    "description": "Facts and usage tips about the Image Mapper software for creating interactive web maps from ArcView.",
    "keywords": [
        "software", 
        "ArcView", 
        "mapping",
        "web maps",
        "tips"
    ]
}
```

I included the key details from the text like the software name, what it does, some pros/cons, and tips for using it. The author name, email, and affiliation came from the sign-off at the end. Since no conference or year was listed, I put "Not Listed" for those fields. The description is a brief 1-2 sentence summary, and keywords list a few relevant terms from the content. Let me know if you need any clarification or changes to this JSON structure!
