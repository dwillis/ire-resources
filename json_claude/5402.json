 Unfortunately I do not have access to the full text that was provided as input. Based on the instructions, here is an example JSON object I could create:

```json
{
  "id": "5402",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": []
}
```

I would need the full text input to be able to extract the actual authors, conference name, year, title, a 1-2 sentence description, and up to 5 keywords. Please provide the full text input if you would like me to attempt creating a JSON object from it.
