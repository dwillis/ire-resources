 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": 3234,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": "margotwill@nytimes.com",
      "affiliation": "The New York Times"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Ethnic Media Workshop", 
  "year": "April 2009",
  "title": "Beyond Google: From better searches to the invisible Web",
  "description": "An overview of specialized search engines and databases beyond Google for conducting research.",
  "keywords": [
    "search engines",
    "databases",
    "research"
  ]
}
```

I included the email address and New York Times affiliation for the one author name provided. The conference name and year were taken directly from the input text. The description is a short 1-2 sentence summary. And the keywords list contains a few relevant terms related to the content.
