 Unfortunately I do not have access to the full text referenced in the prompt in order to generate the requested JSON object. Based on the details provided, here is an example JSON object with dummy data that matches the specified format:

```json
{
  "id": "4819",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Associated Press"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Example article title",
  "description": "A short 1-2 sentence summary of the article content",
  "keywords": [
    "journalism",
    "data",
    "investigation" 
  ]
}
```

I would need to see the full text in order to populate the JSON with accurate extracted entities and summary. Please provide the text or clarify if you would simply like an empty example JSON template to demonstrate the structure.
