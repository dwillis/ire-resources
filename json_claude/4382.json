 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input:

```json
{
  "id": 4382,
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "WNYC Data News"},
    {"name": "Liza Stark", "email": null, "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": null,
  "title": "Playing with Arduino",
  "description": "A presentation teaching how to build basic circuits with an Arduino microcontroller.",
  "keywords": ["Arduino", "microcontroller", "circuit", "sensor", "LED"]  
}
```

I included the provided name Liza Stark as an author, used NICAR as the conference since that was mentioned, and did not include a year since one was not clearly identified. The description is a short 1-2 sentence summary, and I chose 5 relevant keywords from the content. Let me know if you would like me to modify anything!
