 Here is a sample JSON object based on the instructions:

```json
{
  "id": "4362",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Associated Press"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": "PIVOT TABLES â€“ NICAR Tipsheet",
  "description": "This tip sheet provides an overview of pivot tables in Excel, including when to use them, step-by-step instructions for creating them, and tips for troubleshooting.",
  "keywords": ["data", "spreadsheet", "analysis", "tutorial"] 
}
```

I left the author name and email null since no names were provided. I used "The Associated Press" as the affiliation since that was the only organization named. The description is a simple 1-2 sentence summary. The conference is "NICAR" based on the text. The year is "Not Listed" since it's not clearly identified. And the keywords are relevant terms from the text, excluding the conference and authors.
