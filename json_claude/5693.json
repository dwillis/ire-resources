 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5693",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Loevy & Loevy"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Top 5 Transparency Goals for the Year Ahead",
  "description": "The text lists 5 transparency goals for the upcoming year from the law firm Loevy & Loevy.",
  "keywords": [
    "transparency", 
    "FOIA", 
    "public officials", 
    "police", 
    "FBI"
  ]
}
```

I extracted the law firm name "Loevy & Loevy" as the affiliation since no individual authors were listed. The conference and year were not clearly identified, so I put "Not Listed". The description summarizes the overall text, and the keywords list 5 major topics covered without repeating the conference or authors.
