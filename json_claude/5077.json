 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5077",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Jeff Kelly Lowenstein", "email": null, "affiliation": null},
    {"name": "Jennifer LaFleur", "email": null, "affiliation": null}, 
    {"name": "John Perry", "email": null, "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "2017",
  "title": "Linear Regression",
  "description": "Gives an overview of linear regression analysis.",
  "keywords": ["OLS", "R-square", "Statistics", "Excel", "PSPP"] 
}
```

I set the id to 5077. For authors, I included the names listed along with null values for email and affiliation since those were not provided. The conference is NICAR, and the year 2017 is listed in the initial text. The title "Linear Regression" and a short 1-2 sentence description are included. Finally, I listed 5 relevant keywords based on topics covered in the text. Let me know if you would like me to modify or improve the JSON object in any way!
