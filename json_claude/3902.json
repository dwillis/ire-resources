 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "3902",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Stephen Stock", "email": null, "affiliation": "KNTV-San Francisco"},
    {"name": "Jaimi Dowdell", "email": null, "affiliation": "IRE"},
    {"name": "Chris Schnaars", "email": null, "affiliation": "USA TODAY"}
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": "Why you (and your shop) need data",
  "description": "Tipsheet on why journalists should use data reporting to produce better stories by adding context, performing watchdog work, and doing unique reporting.",
  "keywords": ["data", "reporting", "tips", "resources", "stories"]
}
```

I extracted the author names, affiliations, conference name, and created a short description and list of keywords. Since a year was not clearly listed, I put "Not Listed" for the year key. The id is 3902 as requested. I did not create any made up email addresses or affiliations. Please let me know if you would like me to modify anything in the JSON object!
