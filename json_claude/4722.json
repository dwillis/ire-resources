 Here is the JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "4722",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "Not Listed"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "FOIA blues",
  "description": "Tips and resources for filing Freedom of Information Act requests as a journalist.",
  "keywords": ["FOIA", "journalism", "reporting", "transparency", "government"]
}
```

I left the author name, email, and affiliation as null since no author was listed. The conference, year, and keywords were also set to default values since those details were not provided. The title and description summarize the main content.
