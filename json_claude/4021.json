 Unfortunately there is not enough context in the instructions you provided for me to generate a full JSON object. To create a JSON object, I would need the actual text or data that the object should be based on. Without any sample input text, I do not have enough information about potential authors, conference names, years, titles, descriptions, or keywords. 

However, here is an example JSON object with made up data just to demonstrate the structure you requested, with id 4021, author name/email/affiliation, conference, year, title, description, and keywords:

```json
{
  "id": "4021",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "John Smith",
      "email": "jsmith@email.com",
      "affiliation": "ABC News"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "2023",
  "title": "Data Journalism Conference",
  "description": "This is a conference on data journalism.",
  "keywords": [
    "journalism",
    "data",
    "conference"
  ]
}
```

Please provide a sample input text that I can use to generate the JSON object with actual data. I'd be happy to create the JSON once I have some text to extract the necessary information from. Let me know if you have any other questions!
