 Here is the JSON object generated from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": 3733,
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "IRE"}, 
    {"name": "Jaimi Dowdell", "email": "jaimi@ire.org", "affiliation": null},
    {"name": "Mark Horvit", "email": "mark@ire.org", "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "List of web tools and resources for searching information, handling files, social media tracking, and data visualization.",
  "keywords": ["web tools", "data", "files", "social media", "visualization"]
}
```

I made the following assumptions and interpretations:
- There is no clear title, so I left it null
- The text appears to be a list rather than a paper/presentation, so I put "Not Listed" for conference and year 
- I included the "IRE" affiliation for the first author since it was mentioned, though no name was listed
- The description summarizes the overall categories covered in the tools listed
- The keywords cover the main topics, excluding conference and author names

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON structure!
