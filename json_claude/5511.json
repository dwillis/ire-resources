 Here is the JSON object created from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "5511",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "Not Listed"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "22 Harvest Street",
  "description": "An investigative story detailing a violent home invasion and assault targeting a man named Niko.",
  "keywords": [
    "crime",
    "assault",
    "investigation",
    "violence",
    "injury"
  ]
}
```

I included a simplified 2 sentence summary for the description, did not include author names or email since none were provided, used "Not Listed" for conference and year since those details were not clearly stated, and included 5 relevant keywords to summarize the content. The id is set to 5511 as requested.
