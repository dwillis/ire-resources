 Unfortunately I do not have enough context to generate the full JSON object you described. From the information provided, I can create a partial JSON with some default values:

```json
{
  "id": "5756",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": []
}
```

To generate a more complete JSON object, I would need more details such as the full text of the article, names of any authors mentioned, the conference (if listed), the year (if listed), a title, keywords, etc. Please provide those additional details and I would be happy to update the JSON object accordingly. Let me know if you have any other questions!
