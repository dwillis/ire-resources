 Unfortunately I do not have enough context in the text to fully populate the requested JSON object. Here is my best attempt:

```json
{
  "id": "3572",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text discusses investigative stories and data analysis done by news organizations.",
  "keywords": ["investigations", "data", "news"]  
}
```

I was unable to extract any author names or affiliations from the text. The text does not clearly identify a conference name or year. For the description, I summarized the overall topic of investigative journalism and data analysis. For keywords, I chose some relevant high-level terms related to the content. Please let me know if you have any other information that could help me improve this JSON structure.
