 Here is the JSON object for the text:

```json
{
    "id": "4242",
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": "Jennifer LaFleur",
            "email": null,
            "affiliation": "CIR"
        },
        {
            "name": "Charles Ornstein",
            "email": null,
            "affiliation": "ProPublica"
        }
    ],
    "conference": "NICAR",
    "year": "Not Listed",
    "title": "Examining Prescribing Patterns in Medicare",
    "description": "The presenters analyzed Medicare Part D prescription data to uncover inappropriate and risky prescribing, billions in waste, and signs of fraud.",
    "keywords": [
        "Medicare", 
        "prescriptions",
        "data analysis",
        "waste",
        "fraud"
    ]
}
```

I made assumptions where details were missing, like leaving email null since none were provided. The conference is NICAR based on the presenters, but the year is not clear so I put "Not Listed". The description summarizes the key findings discussed. The keywords capture some of the main topics, like Medicare, prescriptions, and the issues uncovered in the analysis.
