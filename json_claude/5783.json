 Here is the JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "5783",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Patti DiVincenzo", "email": null, "affiliation": "IRE"},
    {"name": "Dana Amihere", "email": null, "affiliation": "KPCC-89.3"}, 
    {"name": "Youyou Zhou", "email": null, "affiliation": "Quartz"}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "Checklist for promoting and publishing investigative stories across different platforms like print, radio, TV and online.",
  "keywords": ["investigations", "checklist", "publishing", "promotion"] 
}
```

I included the key authors and extracted the names and affiliations. The conference and year were not listed, so I put "Not Listed". The text did not contain a clear title, so I left that key null. For the description, I summarized the purpose of the text. And for keywords, I included some top-level terms related to the content.
