 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input:

```json
{
  "id": 4724,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "2016",
  "title": "THE CYCLE OF A NEWS APP",
  "description": "A presentation slideshow from the NICAR 2016 conference titled \"The Cycle of a News App\" with various images and text.",
  "keywords": [
    "news",
    "app",
    "cycle",
    "NICAR",
    "conference"
  ]
}
```

I left the author name, email, and affiliation null since no authors were listed. I set the conference to "NICAR" and the year to "2016" based on context clues. The description is a brief 1-2 sentence summary of the content. And I included 5 relevant keywords from the content. Let me know if you would like me to modify anything!
