 Here is the JSON object generated from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "5713",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Dallas Morning News"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": "Leveraging J-School Assets",
  "description": "The presentation discusses ideas for journalism projects leveraging assets from multiple university programs and external news organizations.",
  "keywords": [
    "j-school",
    "assets", 
    "projects",
    "programs",
    "news organizations"
  ]
}
```

I left the author name as null since none was listed. The affiliation is set to The Dallas Morning News since that organization was mentioned in the text. The conference and year are set to "Not Listed" since those details were not clearly identified. The description summarizes the main topic in simple terms, and the keywords list relevant terms excluding the conference and authors.
