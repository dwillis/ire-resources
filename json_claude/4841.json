 Here is a JSON object created from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4841",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "The Lens"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2016",
  "title": "Beyond Excel: Use databases and SQL to reduce your workload and enhance your reporting",
  "description": "Excel has limitations for large datasets, complex analysis and reproducibility; SQL and databases provide speed, power and transparency.",
  "keywords": [
    "sql",
    "databases", 
    "analysis",
    "reproducibility",
    "methodology"
  ]
}
```

I set the conference to "IRE" and year to "2016" based on context clues. The description summarizes the main points. The keywords reflect some of the key themes and terms. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON structure!
