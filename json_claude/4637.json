 Unfortunately I do not have enough context to generate the full JSON object you requested. The text provided does not include clear information about a conference, year, title, description, or keywords. I can provide an example JSON skeleton with some dummy data:

```json
{
  "id": "4637",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Example title",
  "description": "Example 1-2 sentence description",
  "keywords": [
    "example",
    "keywords"
  ] 
}
```

To generate a more complete and accurate JSON object, I would need more details from the original text you wish to parse, such as the title, authors, conference name, etc. Please provide the full text you would like converted to JSON, and I would be happy to try again.
