 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "3322",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text provides advice and encouragement for journalists to pursue stories aggressively, build sources, and persevere through challenges.",
  "keywords": [
    "journalism",
    "reporting",
    "sources",
    "tips"
  ]
}
```

I left the author name and title as null since those were not provided. The conference, year, and title were listed as "Not Listed" since those details were also not clearly identified. The description summarizes the main theme and content of the text. The keywords list several topical words minus the conference and authors.
