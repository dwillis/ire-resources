 Unfortunately I do not have enough context to generate the full JSON object you described. From the information provided, I can create a partial template:

```json
{
  "id": "5641",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": []
}
```

If you could provide the original text you would like me to parse, I would be happy to generate the full JSON object with appropriate values populated based on your specifications. Please let me know if you can provide that text or clarify what information I should be extracting.
