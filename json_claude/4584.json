 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4584",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Bill Dedman", "email": null, "affiliation": "Newsday"}, 
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Writing memorable investigative stories (even with data)",
  "description": "Bill Dedman of Newsday gives suggestions for writing investigative stories, such as covering the full scope, rebutting rebuttals, making graphics, using singular voices, stating unknowns, and scoping statements.",
  "keywords": ["writing", "investigative", "stories", "data", "journalism"]
}
```

I extracted the only clear author name, set the conference and year to "Not Listed" since those details were not provided, and summarized the key points into a description. The keywords list the main topics covered in the talk.
