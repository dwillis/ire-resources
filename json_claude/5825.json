 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5825",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Mark Greenblatt", 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Newsy"
    },
    {
      "name": "Mark Fahey",
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "Newsy"
    },
    {
      "name": "Emily Harris",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Reveal from the Center For Investigative Reporting"
    },
    {
      "name": "Sophie Chou",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "ProPublica" 
    },
    {
      "name": "Nadia Hamden",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "KUT, Austin"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "2019",
  "title": "Behind the story: Case Cleared",
  "description": "The story examines how dozens of police agencies in America inflate clearance rates for rape through use of 'exceptional clearance.'",
  "keywords": [
    "clearance rates",
    "rape",
    "police",
    "data",
    "investigation"
  ]
}
```

I included the key details like the id, authors, conference, year, title, a short description, and relevant keywords. For authors, I included their names and affiliations if listed, leaving email null. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional suggestions for improving the JSON!
