 Here is the JSON object:

```json

      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "Wall Street Journal"
    },

    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",

  "keywords": [
    "IRS",
    "990", 
    "nonprofits",

    "tips"
  ] 
}
```

I parsed the text to identify the conference (NICAR), year (2018), and authors' affiliations (Wall Street Journal and Boston Globe). The id is set to 5429. The description summarizes the main topic. The keywords list relevant terms from the content.
