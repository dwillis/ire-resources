 Here is the JSON object generated from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "3533",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "David McKie",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "CBC News Investigations"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "Tips for using numbers and data to tell compelling stories as a journalist.",
  "keywords": [
    "journalism",
    "data",
    "stories", 
    "numbers",
    "reporting"
  ]
}
```

I included the key details from the text like the author's name and affiliation, set the conference to NICAR based on context, and did not find a clear year or presentation title. The description summarizes the main topic, and the keywords list some relevant terms. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON structure!
