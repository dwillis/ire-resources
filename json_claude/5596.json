 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5596",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "@IRE_NICAR"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": "TURNING DATA INTO TV & ONLINE GOLD",
  "description": "Tips and tools for using data to create online interactives and tell stories.",
  "keywords": ["storytelling", "interactives", "data", "tools", "tips"]
}
```

I set the conference to "IRE" since @IRE_NICAR is mentioned. The year is "Not Listed" since no specific year is given. The description summarizes that the presentation gives tips and tools for using data to create online interactives and tell stories. The keywords list relevant terms from the content without the conference name or authors.
