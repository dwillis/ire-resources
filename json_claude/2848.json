 Unfortunately I do not have enough context to generate a full JSON object from the text you provided. To create an accurate JSON response, I would need more details about the source text such as the conference name, year, authors, etc. Please provide the full source text you would like me to parse into a JSON object. Making up random names or details would not result in an accurate representation of the data. When you have the source text ready, feel free to provide it to me again and I'd be happy to parse it into the requested JSON format.
