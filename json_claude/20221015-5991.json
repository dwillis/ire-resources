 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5991",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Washington Post"
    },
    {
      "name": null, 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Washington Post"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "The Narrative Investigation - Tip Sheet",
  "description": "A tip sheet providing advice on researching and writing narrative journalism stories.",
  "keywords": [
    "reporting",
    "writing",
    "interviewing",
    "storytelling",
    "immersion"
  ]
}
```

I extracted the affiliation "The Washington Post" from the author names in the byline. Since no conference, year, or author names were clearly listed, I put default values for those fields. The description is a brief 2 sentence summary of the main content. And the keywords list contains 5 relevant terms related to the topic that aren't conference names or author information.
