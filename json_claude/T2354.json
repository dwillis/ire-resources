 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

{
    "id": "T2354",
    "authors": [
        {"name": "Bernard J. Wolfson", "email": null, "affiliation": "The Orange County Register"},
        {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "The Orange County Register"}
    ],
    "conference": "NICAR", 
    "year": "Not Listed",
    "title": "Here's how we did it, and how it can help you",
    "description": "The Orange County Register describes how it created a hospital report card to help readers make informed healthcare choices.",
    "keywords": [
        "hospital", 
        "report card",
        "quality",
        "measures",
        "experts",
        "ratings"
    ]
}
