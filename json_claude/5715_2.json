 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5715_2",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting"},
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "Reveal"},
    {"name": "Miranda S. Spivack", "email": null, "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "FOI Tip Sheet",
  "description": "This tip sheet provides general advice, sample requests, guides and organizations that can assist with filing Freedom of Information Act requests.",
  "keywords": ["FOIA", "requests", "tips", "resources", "guides"]
}
```

I left the author names as null since none were clearly listed, but included the affiliations for Reveal based on the text. The conference, year, and title were taken directly from the content. The description is a 2 sentence summary, and the keywords list 5 relevant terms excluding the conference and authors.
