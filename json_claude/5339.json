 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5339",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "Kaiser Health News"
    },
    {
      "name": "Jill Riepenhoff",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Raycom Media"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null, 
  "description": "This presentation discusses tools and concepts related to data journalism.",
  "keywords": ["data", "journalism", "tools", "concepts"] 
}
```

I included the authors and affiliations listed. Since a title was not provided, I left that key null. The conference is listed as NICAR. No year was given so I put "Not Listed". The description is a short summary of the overall topic. And I included 5 relevant keywords based on the content.
