 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5340_1",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "Kaiser Health News"
    },
    {
      "name": "Jill Riepenhoff",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Raycom Media"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "What the Hell is D3? R? VR? DVR?",
  "description": "The authors present common data and technology terminology and concepts.",
  "keywords": ["data", "technology", "terminology", "concepts", "definitions"]
}
```

I included the author names that were listed, used the affiliations from the input text, summarized the content in the description, listed "NICAR" as the conference since that acronym appeared in the text, put "Not Listed" for the year since no year was given, and included 5 relevant keywords excluding the conference and authors. Let me know if you would like me to modify anything!
