 Here is the JSON object for the text:

  "conference": "CAR",
  "year": "2011",

  "description": "Tips on developing a mindset to quantify or measure something in stories rather than just reporting the facts.",
  "keywords": ["data", "analysis", "quantify", "questions", "trends"]
}
```

I summarized the key points about using a "data state of mind" to find and tell stories, focused on quantifying and measuring rather than just reporting all sides. The conference is CAR, the year is 2011 based on the text, and I chose 5 representative keywords.
