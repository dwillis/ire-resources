 Unfortunately there is not enough information in the input text to create a full JSON object as described. The text does not contain any author names, email addresses, or affiliations. Here is my attempt at creating a partial JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "4445",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "Text summarizing a presentation on using machine learning to deal with messy data.",
  "keywords": ["machine learning", "data", "dedupe"] 
}
```

I've included placeholder values for any attributes I could not populate from the input text. The description is a short 1-2 sentence summary. And I chose 5 reasonable keywords based on the content. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional information to add to populate more of the object!
