 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5690",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "Facebook group 'Journalists Covering Trauma'"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Covering Mass Shootings",
  "description": "Tips, story ideas, links and words of encouragement for journalists covering mass shootings and trauma.",
  "keywords": [
    "mass shootings", 
    "trauma", 
    "coverage", 
    "tips", 
    "advice"
  ]
}
```

I extracted the relevant information to populate the desired keys and values in the JSON object. The id is set to 5690. The authors name, email, and affiliation are null since no authors were listed. The conference and year are "Not Listed" since those details were not provided. The title and description summarize the content. And the keywords list relevant topics covered in the text.
