 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the text:

```json
{
  "id": "4387",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "The Associated Press"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2015",
  "title": "Sixteen solutions for data-driven projects",
  "description": "The speaker presented 16 best practices for data journalism projects related to automation, testing, documentation and other areas.",
  "keywords": [
    "data journalism",
    "best practices",
    "automation",
    "testing",
    "documentation"
  ]
}
```

I included "The Associated Press" as the one affiliation since Christopher Groskopf was listed in the text. The description is my attempt at a 1-2 sentence summary. And I chose 5 relevant keywords related to the core topics covered. Let me know if you would like me to modify or improve the JSON object in any way!
