 Here is the JSON object for the tipsheet text:

```json

         "name":null,
         "email":"bagcam@pacbell.net",
         "affiliation":"TeleMedia News Productions/TheEnterpriseReport.com"
      },
      {
         "name":"Jessica Stone",
         "email":"jessicathereporter@gmail.com",

      {

      }
   ],
   "conference":"IRE",
   "year":"2010",
   "title":"MAKING IT AS AN INVESTIGATIVE FREE AGENT",
   "description":"Tips for journalists transitioning to freelance investigative reporting.",
   "keywords":[
      "freelance",
      "investigative",
      "reporting",
      "pitching",
      "equipment"
   ]
}
```

I summarized the main topics, extracted the conference name and year, listed the author info where available, and selected 5 relevant keywords. Let me know if you need any changes to this JSON structure.
