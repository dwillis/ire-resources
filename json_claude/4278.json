 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
    "id": "4278",
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": null,
            "email": null,
            "affiliation": null
        }
    ],
    "conference": "Not Listed",
    "year": "Not Listed",
    "title": null, 
    "description": "Article outlines the history of the Louisiana public records law and the right to access public records, including a summary of the law, definitions of key terms, interpretations by courts, exceptions to access, how requests work, enforcement procedures, and records preservation requirements.",
    "keywords": [
        "Louisiana",
        "public records", 
        "law",
        "access",
        "requests"
    ]
}
```

I left the title, author name and email/affiliation blank since those were not provided. The conference and year are "Not Listed" since those details were also not given. The description is a short 2 sentence summary, and I included 5 keywords related to the overall topic that weren't the conference name or author info. Everything is enclosed in double quotes. Let me know if you need any changes!
