 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
   "id":5787,
   "authors":[
      {"name":null, "email":null, "affiliation":"Pew Stateline stateline.org"}
   ],
   "conference":"NICAR",
   "year":"Not Listed",
   "title":"Black Home Values Have Not Kept Pace",
   "description":"An analysis of home values in majority black neighborhoods found they were more likely to lose value and less likely to gain substantial value compared to other areas.",
   "keywords":[
      "housing",
      "property values",
      "race",
      "equity"
   ]
}
```

I made assumptions to create the 1-2 sentence summary, used the organization name for the author affiliation since no individual author name was given, assumed the conference based on the domain name in the URL, and listed property values and equity as additional potential keywords based on the summary of the analysis. Let me know if you would like me to modify anything!
