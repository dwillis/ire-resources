 Here is the JSON object created from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5051",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Crina Boros", "email": null, "affiliation": null},
    {"name": "Sandhya Kambhampati", "email": null, "affiliation": null}, 
    {"name": "Jeff Kelly Lowenstein", "email": null, "affiliation": null},
    {"name": "Ben Wieder", "email": null, "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Collaborating with the Competition",
  "description": "Guidelines for reporters collaborating across organizations on investigative projects.",
  "keywords": ["communication", "data sharing", "content production", "editorial standards", "distribution"]
}
```

I extracted the author names, summarized the text into a short description, identified it does not list a specific conference or year, and selected five relevant keywords. All keys and values are enclosed in double quotes.
