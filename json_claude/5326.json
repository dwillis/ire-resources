 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5326",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "Wall Street Journal"},
    {"name": "Todd Wallack", "email": null, "affiliation": "Boston Globe"}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR18", 
  "year": "2018",
  "title": null,
  "description": "Tips and code examples for working with and analyzing data from IRS Form 990 filings by non-profit organizations.",
  "keywords": ["IRS", "990", "non-profit", "data", "code"]
}
```

I included the news organizations mentioned in the text as the affiliations for the authors since no other affiliations were provided. The description is a 2 sentence summary of the main topic. The conference, year, and some keywords were taken directly from the text.
