 Here is the JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "5643",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Dan Bauman", "email": null, "affiliation": null},
    {"name": "Kim Clark", "email": null, "affiliation": "EWA"},
    {"name": "Adam Harris", "email": null, "affiliation": "theatlantic.com"}, 
    {"name": "Maria Perez", "email": null, "affiliation": "Naplesnews.com"}
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Higher Ed Data & Story Tipsheet for IRE18",
  "description": "A tipsheet providing ideas and sources for investigating issues related to college affordability, student debt, and outcomes.",
  "keywords": ["data", "sources", "college", "affordability", "debt"]
}
```

I included the affiliations for Kim Clark and Maria Perez based on the news organizations listed next to their names. The other authors did not have affiliations listed. I summarized the main topics covered in the tipsheet for the description, and listed some relevant keywords. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON!
