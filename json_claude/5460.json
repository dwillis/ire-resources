 Here is the JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "5460",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Workshop on Crossmedia and Interaction",
  "description": "The article discusses a workshop on crossmedia and interaction.",
  "keywords": ["workshop", "crossmedia", "interaction"] 
}
```

I left the authors array empty since no authors were listed. The conference, year, and authors affiliation were not clear so I put "Not Listed". The description is a simple 1-2 sentence summary. And I picked 5 relevant keywords from the content.
