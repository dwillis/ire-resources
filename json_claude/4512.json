 Here is the JSON object for the text:

```json
{
  "id": "4512",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Courtney Mabeus", "email": null, "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Tipsheet: Social media",
  "description": "Tipsheet providing advice on using social media to cover threats against journalists overseas without traveling.",
  "keywords": ["social media", "reporting", "journalists", "tips"]  
}
```

I included the key details from the text - the author name, the fact that no conference or year is listed, a short description summarizing the main point, and a few relevant keywords. I left email and affiliation null since those details were not provided. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON structure!
