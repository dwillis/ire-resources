 Unfortunately I do not have access to the full text that was provided with the instructions. Based on the information given, here is an attempt at creating the requested JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "5746",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": []
}
```

I have included the requested keys and set most values to "Not Listed" or null since I do not have enough context in the provided instructions. The id is set to 5746 and authors contains a single element with null values. Please provide the full text that this JSON object should be based on if you need me to generate a more accurate and complete result. I'd be happy to update my response with an appropriate JSON object once I have access to that source text.
