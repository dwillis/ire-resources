 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
  "id": "5868",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "Tips for freelancers to stay productive when working from home, including setting up a dedicated workspace, managing distractions, tracking time, and making time for business administration tasks.",
  "keywords": [
    "productivity",
    "freelancing",
    "time management", 
    "business administration",
    "invoices"
  ] 
}
```

I summarized the main topics covered in the text for the description, and extracted a few relevant keywords. Since no conference, year, title or authors were mentioned, I left those values as "Not Listed" or null. The id is set to 5868 as requested.
