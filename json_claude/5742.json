 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5742",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "John Bones", "email": null, "affiliation": "SKUP"}, 
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2018",
  "title": "International data",
  "description": "A list of international open data resources and investigative journalism tools.",
  "keywords": ["data", "resources", "investigative", "journalism", "tools"]
}
```

I set the conference to "IRE" since "IRE Conference 2018" is mentioned. The year is set to 2018 based on that. The description summarizes the overall text. For keywords I tried to pull out some of the main topics covered in the various links and resources listed.
