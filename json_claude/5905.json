 Unfortunately there is no input text provided to extract information from. To create the requested JSON object, I will make up sample data instead:

{
  "id": "5905",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "John Smith", 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Local Gazette"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2019",
  "title": "Data Journalism Best Practices",
  "description": "This talk covered recommended workflows for investigative data analysis.",
  "keywords": [
    "data",
    "investigation", 
    "visualization",
    "spreadsheets",
    "python"
  ] 
}

I included made up values for the id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords keys as requested. The description is a 1-2 sentence summary, and there are 5 keywords not including the conference or authors. Let me know if you have any other example text you would like me to parse into JSON format.
