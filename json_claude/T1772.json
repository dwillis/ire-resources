 Unfortunately there is no clear conference, year or author information provided in the text. Here is my best attempt at creating the requested JSON object:

{
  "id": "T1772",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": "Backgrounding Business & Pretty Much Any(thing/one) Else",
  "description": "The article provides an overview of resources and techniques journalists use to research businesses, organizations and individuals.",
  "keywords": [
    "backgrounding",
    "research",
    "journalism",
    "business",
    "public records"
  ]
}
