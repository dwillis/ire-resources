 Here is the JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": 2872,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Maud Beelman", 
      "email": "mbeelman@dallasnews.com",
      "affiliation": "The Dallas Morning News"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2006",
  "title": "The role of the editor: Conceiving and managing investigative reporting",
  "description": "The text outlines effective strategies for managing large investigative reporting projects including structuring the reporting process, holding productive meetings, creating outlines and timelines, writing early drafts, and preparing for publication.",
  "keywords": [
    "editing",
    "investigations", 
    "project management",
    "reporting"
  ]
}
```

I parsed out the key details from the text to populate the JSON object. The id is set to 2872. There is one listed author, Maud Beelman, with email and affiliation details. The conference is IRE and the year 2006 is listed. I created a 1-2 sentence summary for the description, and listed relevant keywords without the conference name or author details.
