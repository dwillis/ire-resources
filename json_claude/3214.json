 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the text:

{
  "id": "3214",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null, 
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "Investigative Reporters and Editors, Inc."
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "2009",
  "title": "Finding Enterprise in CAR Data",
  "description": "Tipsheets provide ideas for using computer-assisted reporting data to find story ideas and set deadlines for beating the competition.",
  "keywords": ["data", "stories", "reporting", "tips", "ideas"]
}

I set the conference to "NICAR" since that term appeared several times. The year was listed as 2009 in the footer. For authors, there was no individual name given, so I left name as null and used the organization name, Investigative Reporters and Editors, Inc., for the affiliation since that was listed. The description is a short summary of the main points. And keywords lists some top terms, excluding conference and authors.
