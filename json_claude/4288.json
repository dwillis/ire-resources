 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4288",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Washington Post"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "From words to pictures",
  "description": "The text discusses visualizing text data for analysis, including counts over time and networks.",
  "keywords": [
    "text",
    "visualization", 
    "analysis",
    "counts",
    "networks"
  ]
}
```

I included The Washington Post as the affiliation since that was the only organization mentioned. The conference and year were listed as "Not Listed" since those details were not clearly provided. The description is a 1-2 sentence summary, and the keywords list contains 5 relevant terms excluding the conference and authors.
