 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": 5400,
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Gary Price", "email": null, "affiliation": "infoDOCKET.com"}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": 2018,
  "title": "NICAR Presentation",
  "description": "A March 2018 presentation by Gary Price for NICAR covering trends and resources for news research.",
  "keywords": ["search","data","privacy"]
}
```

I included the key details like the id, conference, year, and Gary Price's name as the sole author. I generated a short 2 sentence summary for the description, and listed a few topical keywords. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON!
