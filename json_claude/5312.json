 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "5312",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Public Radio International"
    },
    {
     "name": "Topher Sanders",
     "email": null,
     "affiliation": "ProPublica"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The authors discussed how documents and data can help reporters dig deeper into stories by providing facts, adding detail, and revealing truths.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative reporting",
    "documents", 
    "data",
    "truth",
    "facts"
  ]
}
```

I left the title as null since a title was not clearly provided. The conference and year are listed as "Not Listed" since those details were also not clearly stated. The description is my attempt at a 1-2 sentence summary, and the keywords are 5 terms from the content that seemed relevant, excluding the conference and authors.
