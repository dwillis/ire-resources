 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "T2338",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Minneapolis Star Tribune"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Hollywood C.A.R. Conference",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Snake Charming: A Journalist Introduction to Python Programming",
  "description": "An introduction to Python programming geared towards journalists and media professionals.",
  "keywords": [
    "Python",
    "programming",
    "journalism",
    "media"
  ]
}
```

I left the author name and email as null since no names were listed. I used "Minneapolis Star Tribune" as the affiliation since that was mentioned in the text. The conference name and year were taken directly. The description is a brief 1-2 sentence summary. And the keywords list contains relevant terms related to the content.
