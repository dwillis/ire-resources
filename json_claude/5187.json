 Unfortunately I do not have enough context in the text you provided to create a detailed JSON object with all the requested keys. If you could provide the full text you wish me to summarize and extract details from, I would be happy to try again. For now, here is a simple JSON object with some placeholder values:

```json
{
  "id": "5187",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": []
}
```

Please provide the full text and I can parse out the details to populate a more complete JSON object. Let me know if you have any other questions!
