 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input:

{
  "id": "4748",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "ProPublica"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": "How to Protect Your Digital Privacy Now That Abortion Laws Have Changed",
  "description": "A guide to using privacy tools to protect your digital information when seeking abortion services or related information.",
  "keywords": [
    "privacy", 
    "security",
    "encryption", 
    "abortion",
    "digital rights"
  ]
}

I included "ProPublica" as the one affiliation since that was the only organization named. The description summarizes the main focus of the content. And I chose 5 relevant keywords based on main topics covered in the text. Please let me know if you would like me to modify anything!
