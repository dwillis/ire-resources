 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4204",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Anna Hewson", "email": null, "affiliation": "KUSA"},
    {"name": "Byran Staples", "email": null, "affiliation": "WTVF"}, 
    {"name": "Joe Ellis", "email": null, "affiliation": "KXAN-TV"},
    {"name": "Steve Eckert", "email": null, "affiliation": "KARE"}
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2014",
  "title": "Undercover on a budget",
  "description": "Tips and advice for doing undercover journalism projects on a limited budget using hidden cameras and microphones.",
  "keywords": ["undercover", "investigative", "budget", "equipment"]
}
```

I extracted the conference name, year, and author names and affiliations from the text. The description is a short summary, and I chose 5 representative keywords. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON structure!
