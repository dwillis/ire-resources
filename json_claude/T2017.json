 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

{
  "id": "T2017",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Nancy Amons",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "WSMV-TV"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "2004",
  "title": "CAR for TV: Getting Started",
  "description": "This text provides tips for journalists with little computer-assisted reporting experience on easy stories to investigate using simple spreadsheets and databases.",
  "keywords": [
    "spreadsheets",
    "databases", 
    "investigations",
    "stories",
    "tips"
  ]
}

I extracted the author name, email, and affiliation from the contact information provided. Since a conference and year were listed, I included those. For the description, I summarized the main focus of the text. And for keywords, I tried to identify 5 topical terms related to the content.
