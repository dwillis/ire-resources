 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4235",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "Center for Investigative Reporting"
    },
    {
       "name": "Jennifer LaFleur",
       "email": null,
       "affiliation": "Center for Investigative Reporting"
    },
    {
      "name": "Eva Paterson",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Equal Justice Society"
    },
    {
      "name": "Ricardo Sandoval",
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "NPRâ€™s Morning Edition"
    },
    {
       "name": "Chrys Wu",
       "email": null,
       "affiliation": "The New York Times" 
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Data Journalism Ethics",
  "description": "A panel discussion on ethics in data journalism covering topics like accuracy, transparency, bias and privacy.",
  "keywords": ["ethics", "data", "accuracy", "transparency", "bias"]
}
```

I set the id to 4235 as requested. For the authors, I included the affiliations listed in the text and left name, email null when not provided. The conference is "IRE" based on the hashtags. The year is unspecified, so I put "Not Listed". The description is a short 1-2 sentence summary. And keywords includes relevant terms from the discussion while limiting to 5 and avoiding duplicate conference name and author terms. Let me know if you would like me to modify anything!
