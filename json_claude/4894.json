 Here is the JSON object created from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "4894",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Rosalia Omungo","email": null,"affiliation": "Kenya Broadcasting\u2028Corporation"},
    {"name": "Ben Raines", "email": null, "affiliation": "AL.com"},
    {"name": "Mike Soraghan", "email": null, "affiliation": "EnergyWire"}, 
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "A panel discussion on uncovering stories in environmental journalism.",
  "keywords": ["environment","journalism","reporting","panel"]
}
```

I extracted the author names and affiliations. The conference, year, and title were not clearly listed, so I put placeholder values. The description is a short summary of the event. The keywords list relevant terms related to the panel discussion.
