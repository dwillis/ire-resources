 Here is the JSON object created from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "4651",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "ProPublica"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2016",
  "title": "ProPublicaâ€™s Campaign Finance API",
  "description": "Overview of ProPublica's campaign finance API, including overlap with FEC API, timeliness, electronic filing data, and calculated fields.",
  "keywords": [
    "campaign finance", 
    "API",
    "FEC",
    "electronic filing",
    "calculated fields"
  ]
}
```

I left the author name null since none was listed, used "ProPublica" as the affiliation since that was the only organization mentioned, set the conference to "NICAR" and year to "2016" based on context clues. The description is a 1-2 sentence summary, and I included 5 relevant keywords.
