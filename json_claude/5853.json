 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5853",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "Independent Journalist"},
    {"name": "Jill Riepenhoff", "email": null, "affiliation": "InvestigateTV/Gray Television"}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Fast and Furious Investigations",
  "description": "Learn how to quickly investigate breaking news and politician claims by building sources and finding documents and data.",
  "keywords": ["investigations", "documents", "data", "tips", "ideas"]
}
```

I included the key details from the text like the id, authors, conference, title, and description. I generated a 1-2 sentence summary for the description. The year was not clearly listed, so I put "Not Listed". The keywords list includes relevant terms from the content.
