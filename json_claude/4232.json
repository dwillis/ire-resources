 Unfortunately there is not enough information in the text to construct the requested JSON object. The text does not contain any clear author names, conference information, titles, etc. to populate several of the requested fields. The best I can do is return an incomplete JSON object as follows:

```json
{
  "id": "4232",
  "authors": [], 
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "Tips for news organizations on how to prioritize and develop investigative journalism despite resource constraints.",
  "keywords": ["investigative journalism", "news organizations", "reporting"] 
}
```

I've included a short description summarizing the main topic, left authors and title as null since no names or titles were provided, and listed "Not Listed" for the conference and year fields. The keywords reflect some of the main themes, but without more context it's difficult to determine the most relevant terms. Please let me know if you have any other information that could help populate additional fields.
