 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
  "id": "3850",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "Washington Post"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "The Message Machine",
  "description": "The text discusses using data mining and machine learning techniques like document clustering and decision trees to analyze data.",
  "keywords": ["data mining", "machine learning", "document clustering", "decision trees"] 
}
```

I extracted the Washington Post as the affiliation since it was mentioned as a news organization in the text. The conference was listed as NICAR. The year was not clearly identified, so I put "Not Listed". For the description, I summarized that the text discusses different machine learning techniques for analyzing data. And for keywords I listed some of the main methods mentioned - document clustering, decision trees, data mining, and machine learning.
