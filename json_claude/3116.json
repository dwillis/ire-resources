 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
  "id": "3116",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "WTAE TV"}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Open Records",
  "description": "Article details steps to take after being denied access to public records under open records laws, including filing appeals and lawsuits.",
  "keywords": ["public records", "denial", "appeal", "lawsuit", "reporting"]  
}
```

I extracted the author's affiliation from the text, but there was no clear author name or email listed. The conference and year were also not identifiable, so I put "Not Listed". The description summarizes the main content, and the keywords list 5 relevant terms related to the topic that aren't authors or conference.
