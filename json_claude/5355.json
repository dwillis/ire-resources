 Unfortunately there is no input text provided to extract information from. To create the requested JSON object, I will leave the author name, email and affiliation fields null, along with empty lists for keywords and authors, and provide dummy text for the other fields:

```json
{
  "id": "5355",
  "authors": [],  
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "No title provided",
  "description": "No input text was provided to summarize.",
  "keywords": [] 
}
```

Please provide the input text and I would be happy to extract the requested information to populate the JSON object.
