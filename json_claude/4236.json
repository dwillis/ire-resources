 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4236",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Ellen Gabler",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Deadly Delays",
  "description": "The article discusses issues related to delays in medical care.",
  "keywords": [
    "medical care", 
    "delays",
    "investigations",
    "transparency",
    "sources"
  ]  
}
```

I included the one author name that was listed, used the news organization as their affiliation, and made my best attempt at a 1-2 sentence summary for the description. I chose 5 relevant keywords from the content. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON structure!
