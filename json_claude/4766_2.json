 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the text:

{
    "id": "4766_2",
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": null,
            "email": null, 
            "affiliation": null
        }
    ],
    "conference": "NICAR",
    "year": "2016",
    "title": "Tipsheet â€“ finding International Data",
    "description": "The text provides tips on finding international data sets using advanced Google searches, data portals, third party sites, social media and contacting people.",
    "keywords": [
        "data",
        "international", 
        "Google",
        "search",
        "portals"
    ]
}

I left the author name, email and affiliation null since no authors were listed. The conference is NICAR based on it being mentioned, the year is 2016 since that is mentioned as when the presentation occurred. The description summarizes the main points, and the keywords list some of the main topics covered.
