 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "3207",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Helena Bengtsson", "email": null, "affiliation": "Sveriges Television"}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "Helena Bengtsson shares contact information and data sources from Europe that may be useful for journalists.",
  "keywords": ["data", "Europe", "journalists", "sources"]
}
```

I extracted the author name and affiliation from the closing of the email. Since no conference, year, or title were listed, I put "Not Listed" for the conference and year keys. The description is a 1-2 sentence summary of the overall content. For keywords, I listed some topical words related to the shared data sources. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON structure!
