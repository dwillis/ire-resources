 Here is the JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "4738",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Fabiola Torres",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "OjoPublico"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2016",
  "title": "The exploding ecosystem of health data",
  "description": "An overview of the Intensive Care platform from OjoPublico in Peru, which provides data on malpractice in medical services.",
  "keywords": [
    "health", 
    "data",
    "malpractice", 
    "hospitals",
    "profiles"
  ]
}
```

I summarized the key points about the Intensive Care platform, extracted author and organization information, identified the conference and year based on the slides, and listed relevant keywords. I used English values throughout.
