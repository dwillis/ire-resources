 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5712",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Carol Marbin Miller",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    },
    {
      "name": "Karen de SÃ¡",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null  
    },
    {
      "name": "David Jackson",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "When the system is the abuser: Investigating injustice in child welfare",
  "description": "Three veteran investigative reporters share methods they have developed to explore systemic problems in agencies running the foster care system.",
  "keywords": [
    "child welfare", 
    "investigative reporting",
    "public records",
    "interviewing"
  ]
}
```

I extracted the author names from the text, left emails and affiliations as null since none were provided, summarized the description, listed the conference as NICAR since this appears to be tips from a NICAR session, left the year as "Not Listed" since no specific year was given, and provided a list of keywords related to the topics covered.
