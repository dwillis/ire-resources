 Here is the JSON object for Tipsheet #3400:

```json
{
  "id": "3400",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Bill Allison", "email": null, "affiliation": "Sunlight Foundation"},
    {"name": "Wendell Cochran", "email": null, "affiliation": "American University"},
    {"name": "Jonathan D. Salant", "email": null, "affiliation": "Bloomberg News"}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "CAMPAIGN FINANCE: TRACKING THE MONEY",
  "description": "Tipsheet providing an overview of resources for tracking campaign finance contributions and lobbying disclosures in federal and state politics.",
  "keywords": ["campaign finance", "lobbying", "disclosure", "FEC", "CRP"]
}
```

I summarized the main focus of the text, tracked down author affiliations when possible, and selected 5 relevant non-author keywords. The conference and year were not listed, so I put "Not Listed" for those fields. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON!
