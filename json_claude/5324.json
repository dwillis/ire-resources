 Here is the JSON object for the text:

```json
{
  "id": "5324",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null, 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "NBC 6-MIAMI"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",  
  "title": "THE INVESTIGATIVE INTERVIEW OR ... SOME PEOPLE WILL NOT BE THRILLED TO SEE YOU",
  "description": "Tips and strategies for conducting effective on-camera investigative interviews.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative",
    "interview",
    "on-camera",
    "tips",
    "strategies" 
  ]
}
```

I extracted the only identifiable author affiliation as NBC 6-MIAMI. The conference, year, and author name were not listed, so I put placeholders. The description summarizes the main topic, and the keywords list relevant terms excluding the conference and authors.
