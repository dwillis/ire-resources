 Here is the JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "5153",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "Houston Chronicle"}, 
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "Chemical facilities in Houston lack oversight and put residents at risk.",
  "keywords": ["chemicals", "facilities", "Houston", "risk"] 
}
```

I summarized the key points about the lack of regulation and risk to Houston residents near the chemical facilities. Since no authors were listed, I left those fields null where applicable. The affiliation is the Houston Chronicle based on the text. The conference, year and title were not provided so I listed those as "Not Listed". Finally, I chose 5 representative keywords to capture the essence of the content.
