 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4531_edit",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Carol Marbin Miller",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Miami Herald"
    },
    {
      "name": "Michael Sallah",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Miami Herald"
    },
    {
      "name": "Audra Burch",
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "The Miami Herald"
    },
    {
      "name": "Steven Rich",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Washington Post"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text provides tips for data journalists on transforming data analysis into compelling storytelling by using narrative techniques focused on people and characters.",
  "keywords": [
    "data journalism", 
    "storytelling", 
    "reporting",
    "case studies"
  ]
}
```

I included the key details from the text in the JSON object, such as the authors and their affiliations, the lack of conference/year details, a short description summarizing the main point, and relevant keywords. I kept the structure simple with the requested keys and data types. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON object!
