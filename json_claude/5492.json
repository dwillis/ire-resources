I left the author name and email as null since no specific author was listed. The affiliation is NICAR18 since that seems to be the conference it was presented at. The year is 2018 based on this being NICAR18. The description summarizes that it is an intro on what sensor journalism is, examples of it, and how to get involved. The keywords list relevant terms related to the content that weren't already captured in other fields.
