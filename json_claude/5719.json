 Here is the JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "5719",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Trevor Aaronson", "email": null, "affiliation": "Investigative Reporters and Editors"},
    {"name": "Margot Williams", "email": null, "affiliation": "Investigative Reporters and Editors"}
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2018",
  "title": "How to Use Data About U.S. Terrorism Cases",
  "description": "The authors explain how they built a database on U.S. terrorism cases and encourage others to use the openly available data for their own projects.",
  "keywords": ["terrorism", "data", "journalism", "investigation", "database"]
}
```

I set the id to 5719 as requested. For the authors, I included Trevor Aaronson and Margot Williams since those names appeared without email or affiliations. I put their affiliation as Investigative Reporters and Editors based on context. The conference is IRE, and the year 2018 is listed. The description summarizes the main goal of the text. Finally, I chose 5 representative keywords excluding the conference and authors.
