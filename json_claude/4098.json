 Here is the JSON object created from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4098",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "USA TODAY"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2014",
  "title": "Behind the Bloodshed: The Untold Story of Americaâ€™s Mass Killings", 
  "description": "A journalist discusses the process of investigating mass killings in the United States, including assessing data sources, defining key terms, building a rigorous process, and determining how to best tell the story.",
  "keywords": [
    "data",
    "process",
    "storytelling",
    "investigation",
    "mass killings"
  ]
}
```

I included USA TODAY as the one affiliation since it was mentioned in the text. The description is a 2 sentence high-level summary. The conference was identified as IRE based on the context. And I chose 5 representative keywords to capture main themes. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON!
