 Here is the JSON object for the text:

    "keywords": ["legislature", "donations", "gifts", "expenditures", "Virginia"]
}
```

I extracted the conference name, year, and author information from the text. The description summarizes the main topic. The keywords list some of the key terms related to the analysis that was done.
