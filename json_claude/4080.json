 Unfortunately there is not enough information provided in the text to construct the requested JSON object. The text does not contain any author names, email addresses, affiliations, conference name, year, title, description, or keywords. Here is an attempt at constructing a partial JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "4080",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null 
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": []
}
```

I've included some of the required keys, but most values had to be set to null or empty arrays/lists since no information was provided in the original text. Please provide more detailed source text, and I will try again to construct the full JSON object.
