 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
    "id": "2994",
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": "Amy Pyle",
            "email": "apyle@sacbee.com",
            "affiliation": "The Sacramento Bee"
        }
    ],
    "conference": "IRE",
    "year": "2007",
    "title": "Presenting projects: From graphics to the Web* *Or how to make your visual partners less homicidal",
    "description": "Tips for presenting investigative journalism projects in visual formats across print, graphics and the web to maximize impact.",
    "keywords": [ 
        "visuals", 
        "graphics", 
        "web", 
        "teamwork", 
        "presentation"
    ]
}
```

I included the key details from the text - the author name, email, affiliation, conference, title, a short description, and some relevant keywords. I set the ID to 2994 as requested. For the author, I only included Amy Pyle since no other authors were clearly identified. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON!
