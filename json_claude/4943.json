 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4943",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Digging deeper with data and documents",
  "description": "A presentation showing techniques and examples for using data and documents to support investigative stories.",
  "keywords": [
    "data",
    "documents",
    "investigations",
    "integrity checks", 
    "analysis"
  ]
}
```

I set the id to 4943. The authors array has one element with name null since no author name was listed. The affiliation is set to Reveal based on the reference to revealnews.org at the end. The conference is NICAR based on context clues. The year is Not Listed since it is not explicitly stated. The title and description are based on my own summarization of the core content. And I chose 5 representative keywords to capture main topics covered.

Let me know if you need me to correct or improve anything!
