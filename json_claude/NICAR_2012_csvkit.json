 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the text:

{
    "id": "NICAR_2012_csvkit",
    "authors": [
        {"name": "Christopher Groskopf", "email": null, "affiliation": null},
        {"name": "Anthony DeBarros", "email": null, "affiliation": null}
    ],
    "conference": "NICAR", 
    "year": "2012",
    "title": "csvkit",
    "description": "csvkit is a suite of utilities for converting to and working with CSV files.",
    "keywords": ["data", "csv", "conversion", "analysis"]
}

I set the conference to "NICAR" and the year to "2012" based on the context. For the description, I summarized the main point about csvkit being a set of tools for CSV files. The keywords list data-related terms excluding conference, authors, and years. Let me know if you would like me to modify anything!
