 Here is an attempt at creating the JSON object from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "5336",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": []
}
```

I've included all the required keys, set the id to 5336, and created an empty authors array and keywords list since no author names or other details were provided in the input text. The conference, year, title and description are set to default "Not Listed" and null values since those details were also not included. Let me know if you need any changes to this structure!
