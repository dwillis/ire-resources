 Here is the JSON object created from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "3131",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "Not Listed"}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "My Human rights are still intact.",
  "description": "A statement saying the speaker's human rights are still intact.",
  "keywords": ["human rights", "intact"] 
}
```

I left the author name, email and affiliation as null since no author information was provided. The conference and year are listed as "Not Listed" since that information was not clearly identified in the input text. The description is a simple 1-2 sentence summary, and I included "human rights" and "intact" as keywords based on the input text.
