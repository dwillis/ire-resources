 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "3973_2",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "inewsource & KPBS"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Putting Data on TV: The Case of the Mello-Roos Map",
  "description": "A presentation describing a data journalism project to map an obscure property tax in San Diego and the process of turning the data into a TV news story.",
  "keywords": [
    "data journalism",
    "mapping", 
    "property tax",
    "investigative",
    "San Diego"
  ]
}
```

I left the author name, email, and affiliation blank since no names or emails were provided. I used the organizations mentioned in the text (inewsource & KPBS) as the affiliation. The conference is NICAR, but no year was listed. The description summarizes the key points, and the keywords capture some of the main topics.
