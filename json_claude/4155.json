 Here is the JSON object:

  "title": "Reporting on death penalty access",
  "description": "Tips for journalists on investigating and reporting on the death penalty process and access to lethal injection drugs.",
  "keywords": ["death penalty", "lethal injection", "investigation", "reporting"]
}
```

I summarized the key points, extracted the author info, and created a list of relevant keywords. Since no specific conference or year was mentioned, I put "Not Listed" for those values.
