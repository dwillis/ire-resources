 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "2992",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Christine Willmsen",
      "email": "cwillmsen@seattletimes.com",
      "affiliation": "Seattle Times"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Digging deeper into sports stories - on and off the court",
  "description": "An investigative reporter provides tips on using public records to uncover in-depth sports stories.",
  "keywords": [
    "public records",
    "sports",
    "investigative reporting"
  ]
}
```

I extracted the author name, email, and affiliation from the sign-off at the end. Since no conference or year was listed, I put "Not Listed" for those fields. The description is a 1-2 sentence summary, and the keywords list relevant terms from the content.
