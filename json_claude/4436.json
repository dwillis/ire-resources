 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the text:

```json
{
    "id": "4436",
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": null, 
            "email": null,
            "affiliation": "Palm Beach Post"
        },
        {
            "name": null,
            "email": null, 
            "affiliation": "Atlanta Journal Constitution"
        },
        {
            "name": "John Walton",
            "email": null,
            "affiliation": "BBC News" 
        },
        {
            "name": null,
            "email": null, 
            "affiliation": "Georgia News Lab"
        }
    ],
    "conference": "NICAR",
    "year": "2015",
    "title": "Editing Data Stories",
    "description": "Panel discussion on tips for editing data stories with a focus on initial reporting, analyzing data, and presentation.",
    "keywords": [
        "reporting",
        "analysis", 
        "presentation", 
        "engagement",
        "tips"
    ]
}
```

I extracted the conference name and year from the first line. For authors, I checked for named individuals and used their news organizations as affiliations if none was provided. The description is a high-level 1-2 sentence summary. And the keywords try to capture some of the main themes around practices for data stories.
