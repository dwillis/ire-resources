 Here is the JSON object created from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "T2382",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null 
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "",
  "description": "This text does not contain enough information to generate a description.",
  "keywords": []
}
```

I left some values as null or empty since there was no clear information to populate them in the given text. The description summarizes that there is not enough information to generate a description, and keywords is an empty list since no terms were provided excluding the conference and authors. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON object!
