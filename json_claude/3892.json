 Here is the JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "3892",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Mark Horvit", "email": null, "affiliation": "IRE"},
    {"name": "Megan Luther", "email": null, "affiliation": "IRE"}
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": "Not Listed",
  "description": "The text discusses flaws in how a special state police force handles crimes against the developmentally disabled.",
  "keywords": ["Inspection", "salary", "laws", "investigation", "staff"]
}
```

I summarized the key findings into a 1-2 sentence description, used "IRE" as the conference since it's mentioned, left year as "Not Listed" since no year is given, used null for the email and name values since none are provided, and used the named organization for the affiliation. The keywords are taken from the listed data and results in the text.
