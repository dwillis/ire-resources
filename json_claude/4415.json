 Here is the JSON object created from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4415",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "NBC Bay Area"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "Stephen Stock is a senior investigative reporter at NBC Bay Area in San Jose and San Francisco, California.",
  "keywords": ["reporter", "investigative", "NBC", "Bay Area", "San Jose", "San Francisco"]
}
```

I included "reporter", "investigative", "NBC", "Bay Area", "San Jose", and "San Francisco" as keywords based on key terms in the text. Since no conference or year was listed, I put "Not Listed" for those values. The description summarizes that Stephen Stock is a senior investigative reporter at NBC Bay Area covering San Jose and San Francisco.
