 Here is the JSON object created from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "5816",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Scripps & Newsy (Formerly Center for Public Integrity)"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": "Finding Errors in Scanned FEC Paper Filings",
  "description": "The author looked for errors in paper filings of campaign finance documents scanned by a contractor.",
  "keywords": [
    "FEC",
    "campaign finance", 
    "data analysis",
    "filing errors"
  ]
}
```

I set the id to 5816, left authors name as null since a full name was not provided, used the former affiliation listed in the text for the sole author, set the conference to NICAR since that seems to be the event, left year as Not Listed since a specific year was not given, created a 1-2 sentence summary description, and included 5 relevant keywords based on topics discussed in the text.
