 Here is the JSON object created from the text:

```json
{
  "id": "3429",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Lawan Williams", "email": null, "affiliation": "The E.W. Scripps Company"},
    {"name": "Stephen Stock", "email": null, "affiliation": "CBS4, WFOR"},
    {"name": "Megan Chuchmach", "email": null, "affiliation": "ABC News"}, 
    {"name": "Raney Aronson", "email": null, "affiliation": "PBS"}
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": "On the Web/On the Air",
  "description": "Tips for telling stories across television, web and mobile platforms.",
  "keywords": ["multi-media", "digital", "data", "tools", "mapping"]  
}
```

I summarized the key points into a description, extracted the listed authors and affiliations, used "IRE" as the conference since that acronym appears, put "Not Listed" for the year since no specific year is given, and listed 5 relevant keywords based on topics covered in the text.
