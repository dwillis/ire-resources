 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
  "id": "4061",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null, 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Freelance journalist"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Fusion Tables for Beginners",
  "description": "A tutorial presenting basics of using Fusion Tables to analyze and visualize data.",
  "keywords": [
    "fusion tables",
    "data visualization", 
    "mapping"
  ]
}
```

I made the following assumptions:
- No author name was listed, so name is null
- No email was listed, so email is null 
- The text mentioned the author was a freelance journalist, so I used that for affiliation
- The conference and year were not clearly identified, so I put "Not Listed"
- The description summarizes the main topic and purpose of the tutorial
- Keywords describe some of the main topics covered

Let me know if you need me to modify anything!
