 Here is a JSON object based on the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4810",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Associated Press"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The government has access to personal data about citizens.",
  "keywords": [
    "government", 
    "data",
    "privacy",
    "surveillance"
  ]
}
```

I left the name, email, title values as null since those details were not provided in the input text. The affiliation comes from the byline with the AP. The conference, year, and title are listed as "Not Listed" since those details are not clearly identified. The description is a simple 1-2 sentence summary. And the keywords capture some of the main topics, like government, data, privacy, and surveillance.
