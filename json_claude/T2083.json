 Unfortunately I do not have access to the full text to extract all the requested information. Based on the limited snippet provided, here is an attempt at a partial JSON object:

{
  "id": "T2083",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2004",
  "title": null,
  "description": "Tips for using hidden cameras and wireless transmitters when conducting investigative reporting.",
  "keywords": [
    "Hidden Cameras", 
    "Wireless Transmitters",
    "Investigative Reporting"
  ]
}

I left some fields like title and authors blank as those details were not included in the snippet provided. The description is a brief 1-2 sentence summary based on the visible text. The conference was listed as IRE. And the keywords reflect some of the main topics covered in the visible text. Please let me know if you have access to the full text as that would allow me to populate a more complete JSON object per your instructions.
