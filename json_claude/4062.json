 Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```json
{
  "id": "4062",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Jaimi Dowdell", "email": null, "affiliation": null},
    {"name": "Mark Horvit", "email": null, "affiliation": null},
    {"name": "Jennifer LaFleur", "email": null, "affiliation": "OdorMaster"}
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "The year in car (& odors)",
  "description": "A presentation at an IRE conference that involves sniffing numbered scratch-and-sniff cards along with displayed slides.",
  "keywords": ["cars", "odors", "scratch-and-sniff"]
}
```

I included the key details from the text like the author names, the mention of IRE, the title, a short description, and some relevant keywords. Since a specific year was not provided, I put "Not Listed" for the year value. The id and structured authors list were added as specified in the instructions. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON!
