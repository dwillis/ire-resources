 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5609",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "IRE_NICAR"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE_NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "Tips for doing online research and backgrounding sources using search engines, public records, social media, archives and other tools.",
  "keywords": [
    "research",
    "backgrounding",
    "search",
    "public records", 
    "social media"
  ]
}
```

I left the name, email, affiliation fields null for the authors array since no author names were listed. The conference contains the Twitter handles, the year is "Not Listed" since no year is given. The description is a short 1-2 sentence summary of the overall content. And the keywords list contains a few relevant terms related to the tips in the content.
