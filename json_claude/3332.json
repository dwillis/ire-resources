 Unfortunately I do not have access to the full text that was provided. Based on the information in your instructions, here is an attempt at creating the requested JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "3332",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null 
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": []
}
```

I have included the requested keys and structure, but without the full text I cannot accurately populate details like the authors, summary, conference name, etc. If you are able to provide the full text, I would be happy to try again to create a more complete and accurate JSON object. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
