 Here is the JSON object for the text:

```json
{
  "id": "3462_0",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Wendell Cochran",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    },
    {
      "name": "MaryJo Webster", 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2011",
  "title": "GETTING INTO A ‘DATA STATE OF MIND’",
  "description": "The tipsheet discusses approaches for journalists to start thinking about using data in their stories and questions to ask sources to uncover useful data sources.",
  "keywords": ["data", "sources", "questions", "tips"]
}
```

I extracted the conference name, year, and title from the text. The description is a 1-2 sentence summary, and I included 5 relevant keywords. The authors list contains the two names listed, with no additional info provided. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON!
