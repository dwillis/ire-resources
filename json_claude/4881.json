 Unfortunately I do not have access to the input text you referred to in order to create the requested JSON object. If you provide the text you would like me to summarize and extract information from, I would be happy to create the JSON object with id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords based on your specifications. Please provide the input text and I will process it into the requested JSON format. Without the source text I am unable to complete the requested task, but let me know if you have any other questions!
