 Unfortunately I do not have enough context to generate the full JSON object you described. To create an accurate mapping, I would need the original text or document that contains the authors, conference, title, etc. If you could provide that source content, I would be happy to parse it and output the JSON format you specified. Please let me know if you can share the input text, or if you have any other questions!
