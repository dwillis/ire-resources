 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
  "id": "4910",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "Text provides instructions and resources for investigating and reporting breaking news stories.",
  "keywords": [
    "breaking news",
    "investigation", 
    "reporting",
    "social media",
    "background checks"
  ]
}
```

I made the description a short summary of the overall purpose of the text. Since there is no clear title, author names, conference, or year listed, I put null or "Not Listed" for those fields. The keywords reflect some of the major themes and topics covered in the instructions without exceeding 5 terms.
