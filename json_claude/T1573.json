 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "T1573",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "The Center for Public Integrity"}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "2002",
  "title": "The Basics of SQL",
  "description": "A guide explaining the basic syntax and functions of Structured Query Language (SQL) for working with databases.",
  "keywords": ["SQL", "databases", "query", "guide"] 
}
```

I included "The Center for Public Integrity" as the one author's affiliation since that was mentioned in the text. The conference, year, and high-level topic were clear, so I included those. For the description I attempted to summarize the overall purpose/contents in a simple sentence. And for keywords I listed some of the main topics covered, excluding the conference name and authors.
