 Unfortunately I do not have enough context in the provided text to fully populate the requested JSON object. The text does not clearly identify an ID, title, description, year, or keywords. Here is my attempt at populating some of the fields based on the available information:

{
  "id": "4634",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null, 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": [] 
}

I've included the requested ID and set conference and year to "Not Listed" since those details are not clearly provided. The authors, title, description, and keywords arrays are left empty or null since there is no clear content to populate them with based on the input text. Please let me know if you have any other information that could help further populate this JSON object.
