 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
  "id": "4338",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "ProPublica"
    },
    {
      "name": "charles.ornstein",
      "email": "charles.ornstein@propublica.org",
      "affiliation": "ProPublica" 
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "The new ecosystem of health data",
  "description": "The tip sheet offers broad data sources and more granular ones for covering health care.",
  "keywords": [
    "health care", 
    "data",
    "Medicare",
    "Medicaid",
    "doctors",
    "hospitals"
  ]
}
```

I left the first author name as null since it was not provided. For the second author, I used the email address to identify the name. I set the conference to NICAR based on context clues. The year was not clearly stated, so I put "Not Listed". The description is a 1-2 sentence summary, and the keywords list relevant terms excluding the conference and authors.
