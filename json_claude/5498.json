 Here is my attempt at creating the requested JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5498",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Guardian"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Revealed: Wikileaks cables link Russian mafia boss to EU gas supplies",
  "description": "Cables reveal connections between Russian mafia boss Semyon Mogilevich and gas supplies to Ukraine and Europe.",
  "keywords": [
    "Wikileaks",
    "cables",
    "Russia",
    "mafia",
    "gas",
    "supplies",
    "Europe",
    "Ukraine"
  ]
}
```

I included "The Guardian" as the one identifiable affiliation. The description summarizes the key points. And I selected 5 representative keywords excluding the conference and authors, which were both "Not Listed". Let me know if you need any changes to this JSON structure!
