 Unfortunately I do not have the full text to extract structured data from. Based on the instructions provided, here is a partial JSON object with some dummy data:

{
  "id": "5417",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "A 1-2 sentence summary would go here if I had the full text.",
  "keywords": [
    "keyword1",
    "keyword2",
    "keyword3",
    "keyword4", 
    "keyword5"
  ] 
}

I've included the requested key names and structure, but without the full text I cannot accurately extract the name, email, affiliation, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. Please provide the full text and I would be happy to parse out those details.
