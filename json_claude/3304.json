        {"name": "Heather Vogell", "email": "hvogell@ajc.com", "affiliation": "The Atlanta Journal-Constitution"}
    ],
    "conference": "NICAR",
    "year": "Not Listed",
    "title": "Turning schools data into scoops",
    "description": "The text provides tips on using state education data to find stories and trends in areas like test scores, discipline, teaching quality and more.",

}
