 Here is the JSON object based on the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "3562",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "CBS4 WFOR-TV, Miami"
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "California Watch" 
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Before the Storm Hits",
  "description": "The text discusses planning and investigating before a storm or disaster hits.",
  "keywords": [
    "disaster",
    "planning",
    "investigating",
    "preparation",
    "storm"
  ]
}
```

I left the author names as null since they were not provided. The affiliations come from the news organizations listed. The conference is NICAR based on the context. The year is not clearly stated. The description summarizes the main focus of planning and investigating before a disaster. And the keywords hit on some of the main topics covered without repeating the conference or author information.
