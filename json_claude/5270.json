 Here is the JSON object created from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5270",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Ziva Branstetter", "email": null, "affiliation": "Center for Investigative Reporting"},
    {"name": "Jenni Monet", "email": "jennimonet@gmail.com", "affiliation": null},
    {"name": "Craig Harris", "email": null, "affiliation": "Arizona Republic"}, 
    {"name": "Stacy Thacker", "email": null, "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "IRE", 
  "year": "2017",
  "title": "Beyond Casinos and Smoke Shops: How to cover sovereign nations",
  "description": "Panel discussion on best practices for journalists covering Indigenous communities in the U.S.",
  "keywords": ["indigenous", "native american", "journalism", "investigative reporting", "terminology"]
}
```

I extracted the authors, conference name, year, and title from the text. For the description, I summarized the overall topic in a simple sentence. For keywords, I chose 5 relevant terms related to the panel discussion.
