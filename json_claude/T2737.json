 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "T2737",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "James Drew",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Blade"
    },
    {
      "name": "Mike Wilkinson",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Blade"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text provides tips on finding information about lobbyists, consultants, fundraisers, campaign finance, federal contracts, and using open records laws.",
  "keywords": [
    "lobbyists",
    "consultants", 
    "fundraisers",
    "campaign finance",
    "federal contracts",
    "open records laws"
  ]
}
```

I extracted the author names and used "The Blade" as their affiliation since that is mentioned as a news organization in the text. The conference and year are listed as "Not Listed" since those details are not clearly identified. The description summarizes the key topics covered in the text. The keywords list 5 main terms related to the topics, excluding the conference and authors.
