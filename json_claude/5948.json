 Unfortunately I do not have the full text to extract detailed information from. Based on the limited information provided, here is a sample JSON object I could create:

```json
{
  "id": "5948",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": []
}
```

I've included the required keys and structure, but without more context or actual text to extract information from, most of the values are set to null or empty arrays/lists. Please provide the full text you would like me to parse, and I would be happy to populate the JSON with more detailed and accurate information.
