 Here is my attempt at creating the requested JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5016",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "The Lens"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "Tips and resources for using social media to research people for journalistic purposes.",
  "keywords": [
    "social media",
    "research",
    "reporting",
    "journalism",
    "investigation"
  ]
}
```

I set the conference to "NICAR" since the text referenced that conference. The year was not clearly identified, so I set it to "Not Listed". There were no clear author names, emails or title so I left those null. I created a 1-2 sentence summary for the description, and listed 5 relevant keywords, excluding the conference name and authors.
