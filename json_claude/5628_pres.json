 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "5628_pres",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Jamie Grey", "email": null, "affiliation": "Raycom Media"},
    {"name": "Jake Bleiberg", "email": null, "affiliation": "Bangor Daily News"},
    {"name": "Kristin Hussey", "email": null, "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2018",
  "title": "One Journalist, Multiple Hats",
  "description": "Three journalists discuss strategies and tools for being a \"one-reporter band\" who handles all aspects of reporting and content production.",
  "keywords": ["mobile journalism", "tools", "workflow", "productivity", "editing"]
}
```

I parsed the names, affiliations and email addresses for the authors where available. For the description, I summarized the main topic of the presentation. For keywords, I focused on some of the key themes around mobile journalism and being a solo journalist. Let me know if you need me to modify or improve anything!
