 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
  "id": "5318",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "TIPSHEETS",
  "description": "The Investigative Reporters and Editors organization provides more than 5,000 investigative reporting presentations and tipsheets from national and regional conferences.",
  "keywords": [
    "presentations",
    "tipsheets",
    "conferences",
    "investigative reporting"
  ]
}
```

I extracted the key information from the text to populate the JSON object with the requested structure and keys. The id is hardcoded to 5318. The authors list is empty since no author names were provided. The conference is "IRE" based on the reference to the Investigative Reporters and Editors organization. No specific year was given, so I put "Not Listed". The title and first bullet point provide the summary description, and I extracted a few relevant keywords.
