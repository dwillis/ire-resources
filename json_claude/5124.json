 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5124",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "NPR"}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Year in Investigations",
  "description": "An NPR investigation found a dramatic increase in cases of the worst stage of black lung disease among coal miners.",
  "keywords": ["black lung", "coal miners", "disease", "investigation", "NPR"]  
}
```

I included NPR as the affiliation since the text mentions NPR conducted the investigation. The description summarizes the key finding of a 10 times increase in serious black lung cases. The keywords list some topical words from the content. Let me know if you need any changes to this JSON structure!
