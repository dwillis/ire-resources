 Unfortunately I do not have the full text to analyze and extract the requested information. From the instructions provided, it seems you would like me to create a JSON object with specific keys (id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords) and populate the values based on analyzing some text. 

Without the actual text, I cannot reliably populate the JSON. However, here is an example of the structure you requested with placeholder values:

```
{
  "id": "4050",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": [
    "keyword1",
    "keyword2",
    "keyword3",
    "keyword4", 
    "keyword5"
  ]
}
```

Please provide the full text you would like analyzed and I would be happy to populate the JSON with extracted details. Let me know if you have any other questions!
