 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input:

{
    "id": "4865",
    "authors": [
        {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "IRE"},
        {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": null}
    ],
    "conference": "IRE",
    "year": "2016",
    "title": "How To Follow The Money",
    "description": "The National Institute on Money in State Politics promotes transparency by compiling campaign finance data and making it available for free.",
    "keywords": ["campaign finance", "money", "politics", "transparency", "data"]
}

I left the author names and emails as null since none were provided. I set the affiliation for the first author as IRE since that seemed to be the conference. The description is a 1-2 sentence summary of the main point. And I listed 5 relevant keywords related to the content. Please let me know if you would like me to modify anything!
