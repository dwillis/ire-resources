 Here is the JSON object created from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5936",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Blake Ellis", "email": null, "affiliation": "CNN"},
    {"name": "Melanie Hicken", "email": null, "affiliation": "CNN"},
    {"name": "Kristin Hussey", "email": null, "affiliation": null},
    {"name": "Topher Sanders", "email": null, "affiliation": "ProPublica"}
  ],
  "conference": "IRE", 
  "year": "2019",
  "title": null,
  "description": "Tipsheet with resources and strategies for using data and documents in investigative reporting.",
  "keywords": ["data", "documents", "reporting", "investigations", "tips"]
}
```

I set the conference to "IRE" since that is mentioned, and year to "2019" based on the conference location. The description summarizes the overall purpose, and keywords highlight important topics covered without repeating conference and author info. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON!
