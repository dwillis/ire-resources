 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": 5753,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Washington Post"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2023",
  "title": "Tips for learning to code",
  "description": "The panelists give an overview of popular coding languages used in data journalism and provide resources for getting started.",
  "keywords": [
    "coding",
    "data journalism",
    "SQL",
    "Python",
    "R",
    "JavaScript"
  ]
}
```

I set the conference to "NICAR" since this appears to be tips from a NICAR 2023 panel. The year is listed as 2023. The Washington Post is included as an affiliation since it is mentioned, but no author names are given. The description summarizes the main points. And the keywords list some of the main topics covered.
