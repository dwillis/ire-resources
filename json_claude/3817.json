 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": 3817,
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Laura Frank", "email": null, "affiliation": "iNewsNetwork.org"},
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": 2012,
  "title": "Election Watchdog Workshop 2012 Backgrounding Candidates",
  "description": "Email providing sources for gathering background information on election candidates in Colorado.",
  "keywords": ["election", "candidates", "background", "information", "sources"]
}
```

I set the conference to "NICAR" since Laura Frank's email is from iNewsNetwork.org. I included Laura Frank as an author since her name and email are listed. The year is set to 2012 based on the conference title. The description is a 1-2 sentence summary, and keywords list 5 relevant terms. Let me know if you would like me to modify anything!
