 Here is the JSON object for the text:

```json
{
   "id": "3492",
   "authors": [
      {
         "name": "John Stasko",
         "email": null, 
         "affiliation": "Georgia Institute of Technology"
      }
   ],
   "conference": "IRE",
   "year": "2011",
   "title": "Text Visualization",
   "description": "The text discusses different methods and tools for visualizing text data to help analyze documents and identify insights.",
   "keywords": ["visualization", "text", "analysis", "documents", "Jigsaw"]
}
```

I summarized the key points, listed the conference and year, and included relevant keywords. I put the one listed author name and his affiliation. The other values are null since they were not provided.
