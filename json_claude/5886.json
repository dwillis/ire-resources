 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

  "title": "DETECTING BUSINESS FRAUD",
  "description": "Pointers from journalists on finding sources and information to uncover business fraud.",
  "keywords": ["fraud", "sources", "investigation", "whistleblowers", "lawsuits"]
}
```

I summarized the key points about detecting business fraud into a short description sentence. For the conference, I put "IRE" since that acronym is mentioned. The year is listed as 2019. The authors are the three named individuals, with Wall Street Journal, Better Business Bureau, and James Hoyer Law Firm as the affiliations based on context. The keywords list several topical words related to investigating fraud while keeping the list under 5 terms.
