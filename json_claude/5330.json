 Unfortunately there is not enough information provided in your description to create a complete JSON object with all required fields. You mentioned some text but did not include the actual text. Without seeing the text it is impossible to extract author names, affiliations, determine the conference, year, create a description summary, or identify keywords. 

I can provide an example JSON structure with some dummy data:

```
{
  "id": "5330",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "John Smith", 
      "email": "jsmith@example.com",
      "affiliation": "The Example Times"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "2019",
  "title": "An Example Title",
  "description": "This is a short 1-2 sentence summary of the text content.",
  "keywords": ["example", "key", "words"] 
}
```

Please provide the actual text you would like parsed so I can attempt to extract the necessary information and populate an accurate JSON object. Without that source text, I can only provide this basic template. Let me know if you have any other questions!
