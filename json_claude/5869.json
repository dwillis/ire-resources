 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json

      "name": "Michele Deitch",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "University of Texas at Austin"
    },
    {
      "name": "Keri Blakinger", 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Houston Chronicle"
    },
    {
      "name": "Benjamin Conarck",

      "affiliation": "Florida Times-Union"
    },
    {

  ],
  "conference": "IRE",

  "keywords": [
    "prisons",
    "jails", 
    "reporting",
    "oversight",
    "transparency"
  ]
}
```

I extracted the key information from the text and structured it according to the instructions into a JSON format with the requested keys and nested author objects. The description summarizes the overall purpose of the document, and the keywords capture some of the main topics covered.
