 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "5956",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "Investigative reporter"},
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "ire.org"},
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "thedenverchannel.com"}
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "30 stories in 60 minutes", 
  "description": "A presentation listing 30 investigative story ideas that reporters can find data to support in 60 minutes.",
  "keywords": ["investigative", "data", "stories", "reporting", "journalism"]
}
```

I left the author names as null since none were listed. I included the organizations mentioned in the text as affiliations. The conference is IRE based on the @IRE username. No year was listed so I put "Not Listed". The description summarizes the main topic. And I chose 5 relevant keywords from the content.
