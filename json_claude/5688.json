 Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```json
{
  "id": "5688",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Washington Post"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "DocumentCloud + Python",
  "description": "A session explaining how to use the DocumentCloud API with Python.",
  "keywords": [
    "DocumentCloud", 
    "Python",
    "API",
    "automation",
    "documents"
  ]
}
```

I made assumptions about the conference, year, and description since those details were not clearly stated in the input text. The affiliation is based on the mention of the Washington Post. Please let me know if you would like me to modify anything in the JSON object.
