 Here is the JSON object:

```json
{
    "id": "4487",
    "authors": [
        {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": null},
        {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": null}
    ],
    "conference": "NICAR",
    "year": "2015",
    "title": "The Business Reporterâ€™s Toolbox",
    "description": "A guide with resources and strategies for investigating public and private companies, nonprofits, governments, and political activities when reporting on business topics.",
    "keywords": ["investigating", "resources", "strategies", "reporting", "business"]
}
```

I left the author names and emails as null since none were listed, and did not make up any affiliations. The conference is NICAR, and the year 2015 is clearly identified. The description summarizes the overall purpose and content of the text, and the keywords list 5 relevant terms excluding the conference and authors.
