 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
    "id": "Backgrounding_Candidates",
    "authors": [
        {"name": "James V. Grimaldi", "email": "grimaldij@washpost.com", "affiliation": "The Washington Post"}, 
        {"name": null, "email": "jamesvgrimaldi@gmail.com", "affiliation": null}
    ],
    "conference": "Not Listed", 
    "year": "Not Listed",
    "title": null,
    "description": "The text provides backgrounding tips for vetting political candidates.",
    "keywords": ["backgrounding", "candidates", "vetting", "politics", "tips"]
}
```

I included the key details you specified like id, authors, conference, etc. I left the title null since there didn't seem to be a clear title. The description is a 1-2 sentence summary, and keywords lists 5 relevant terms. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements!
