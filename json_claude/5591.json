 Here is the JSON object created from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5591",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "The Washington Post"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Web for Watchdogs",
  "description": "Tips and resources for investigating people and companies online.",
  "keywords": ["research", "databases", "search", "social media", "verification"] 
}
```

I included "The Washington Post" as the affiliation since that was the only news organization mentioned. The description summarizes the main topic. And I chose 5 representative keywords related to the content.
