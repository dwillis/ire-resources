 Here is the JSON object I constructed:

{
  "id": "4117",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,  
  "keywords": []
}

I left most values as null because the input text provided did not contain enough information to populate those fields. The conference and year are listed as "Not Listed" since those details were not provided. And keywords is an empty list since there was no content to extract keywords from. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional information to add to the JSON object.
