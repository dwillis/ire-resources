 Here is the JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "3510",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Blake Morrison",
      "email": "bmorrison@usatoday.com",
      "affiliation": "USA Today"
    },
    {
      "name": "Joel Engelhardt", 
      "email": "jengelhardt@pbpost.com",
      "affiliation": "The Palm Beach Post" 
    },
    {
      "name": "Rose Ciotta",
      "email": "rciotta@phillynews.com",
      "affiliation": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Managers: Bulletproofing the story",
  "description": "Tips for editors on overseeing and supporting major investigative projects at various stages.",
  "keywords": [
    "editing",
    "investigations",
    "lawyers",
    "proofing",
    "sourcing"
  ]
}
```

I summarized the key points into a sentence for the description, used the conference name that appeared, and listed 5 relevant keywords. Since a year was not provided, I put "Not Listed". The author names, emails, and affiliations were taken directly from the text.
