 Unfortunately I do not have enough context to create a full JSON object from the provided text. The text does not clearly contain information needed for some of the requested keys such as id, authors, year, title, description, and keywords. I attempted to extract some information to partially construct the JSON:

{
  "id": "5890",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null, 
  "description": "A discussion between journalists about managing investigative projects alongside daily news reporting responsibilities.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative", 
    "newsroom", 
    "culture", 
    "practices"
  ]
}

But without more context or a clearer mapping of information from the provided text to the requested JSON structure, I cannot confidently fill in all of the desired keys. Please let me know if you can provide any additional information to help construct the full JSON object.
