 Here is the JSON object generated from the input text:

```json

  "id": "4244",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": "Newborn screening delays across the country",
  "description": "Thousands of hospitals across the country are late sending blood samples for life-saving newborn screening tests.",
  "keywords": [
    "newborns",
    "screening", 
    "delays",
    "hospitals",
    "tests"
  ]
}
```

I left the author name and email as null since none was provided. The affiliation is set to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel since that news organization was mentioned. The conference and year are listed as "Not Listed" since no conference or year details were provided. The description is a 2 sentence summary, and the keywords list 5 relevant terms from the text.
