 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5687",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Jessica Huseman",
      "email": "jessica.huseman@propublica.org",
      "affiliation": "ProPublica"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Using data and records to investigate voting",
  "description": "Tips and resources for journalists to understand and report on elections and voting at the local level.",
  "keywords": [
    "elections",
    "voting",
    "data",
    "records",
    "local"
  ]
}
```

I extracted the author name, email, and affiliation from the email signature. Since no conference name or year was provided, I put "Not Listed" for those values. The description is a 2 sentence summary, and the keywords list contains 5 relevant terms related to the content.
