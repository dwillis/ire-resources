 Here is the JSON object generated from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4553",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "David Bornstein", "email": null, "affiliation": "Solutions Journalism Network"},
    {"name": "Tina Rosenberg", "email": null, "affiliation": "Solutions Journalism Network"}, 
    {"name": "Claudia Rowe", "email": null, "affiliation": "Seattle Times Ed Lab"},
    {"name": "Greg Borowski", "email": null, "affiliation": "Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel"}
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "The other half of the story: How reporters can use data to identify 'positive deviants' and add fresh angles to investigative stories",
  "description": "Panel discussion on how journalists can find and report on positive examples and solutions alongside investigative stories on problems.",
  "keywords": ["solutions journalism", "positive deviants", "investigations", "data", "reporting"]
}
```

I extracted the author names, affiliations, conference name, and created a short description and list of keywords. Since a year was not clearly listed, I put "Not Listed" for the year key. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON object!
