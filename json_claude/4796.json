 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4796",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Trevor Aaronson",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Florida Center for Investigative Reporting"
    },
    {
      "name": "Kelly Virella", 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Investigative Fund"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2016",
  "title": "Investigative Reporting on a Shoestring",
  "description": "List of key tools and skills recommended for independent journalists and tiny newsrooms.",
  "keywords": [
    "data",
    "collaboration",
    "encryption",
    "devices"
  ]
}
```

I extracted the conference name ("IRE"), year ("2016") and presentation title from the text. The description summarizes the main point. The keywords list the main categories of tools and skills mentioned without repeating conference, year or author names. Let me know if you need any changes to this JSON structure!
