 Unfortunately I do not have access to the original text you referred to in order to create the requested JSON object. If you could provide the text, I would be happy to attempt to create the JSON object with the specified keys and values based on that text. Without the source text, I am unable to populate the content-related fields such as authors, description, keywords, etc. But I can provide a template with the requested structure and some placeholder data:

```json
{
  "id": "4068",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": [
    null,
    null,
    null,
    null,
    null
  ]
}
```

Please let me know if you can provide the source text so I can attempt to fully populate the JSON object, or if this template is helpful to demonstrate the expected structure.
