 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
    "id": 4799,
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": null,
            "email": null,
            "affiliation": "ProPublica"
        }
    ],
    "conference": "NICAR",
    "year": 2016,
    "title": "Scraping without programming",
    "description": "An introduction to web scraping using tools like OutWit Hub, import.io and Google Sheets.",
    "keywords": [
        "scraping", 
        "data",
        "tools",
        "tutorials"
    ]
}
```

I set the conference to "NICAR" and the year to 2016 based on the text. The title and description are summaries of the content. For keywords I chose some relevant terms related to web scraping and tools. Since no author name was provided, I left name null but set the affiliation to ProPublica since that was mentioned.
