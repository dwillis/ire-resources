 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4784",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "The Associated Press"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "AP Exclusive: Feds plan to move Epstein warden to prison job",
  "description": "The warden in charge when Jeffrey Epstein ended his life in his jail cell is being moved to a leadership position at another federal correctional facility",
  "keywords": ["Epstein", "warden", "prison", "job"] 
}
```

I set the conference and year to "Not Listed" since those details were not provided. The title and first sentence provided the summary for the description field. For keywords, I included relevant terms from the content except for names and the conference value. Let me know if you would like me to modify anything!
