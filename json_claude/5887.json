 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5887",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "TODD WALLACK", 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "BOSTON GLOBE"
    },
    {
       "name": "HOLLY IVEL",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "CANDID"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigating charities and other nonprofits",
  "description": "Todd Wallack and Holly Ivel discuss investigating nonprofits through reviewing IRS 990 filings and other records.",
  "keywords": [
    "nonprofits",
    "990", 
    "investigations",
    "charities",
    "guide"
  ] 
}
```

I included the two author names and their affiliations from the text. Since no email addresses were provided, I left those values as null. I set the conference to "IRE" since that was mentioned, and left the year as "Not Listed" since no specific year was provided. The description summarizes the key points on investigating nonprofits. For keywords, I tried extracting some relevant terms related to nonprofits and investigations.

Let me know if you need any clarification or would like me to modify anything!
