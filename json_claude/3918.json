 Here is the JSON object created from the input text:

```json
{
   "id":"3918",
   "authors":[
      {
         "name":"Sally Kestin",
         "email":null,
         "affiliation":"Sun Sentinel"
      },
      {
         "name":"Nate Carlisle",
         "email":null,
         "affiliation":"Salt Lake Tribune"
      },
      {
         "name":"Lawrence Mower",
         "email":null,
         "affiliation":"Palm Beach Post"
      },
      {
         "name":"Shawn McIntosh",
         "email":null,
         "affiliation":"Atlanta Journal-Constitution"
      }
   ],
   "conference":"NICAR",
   "year":"Not Listed",
   "title":null,
   "description":"Tips and strategies for investigating law enforcement practices and police shootings.",
   "keywords":[
      "police",
      "investigation",
      "oversight",
      "shootings"
   ]
}
```

I made my best attempt to create an accurate JSON representation of the key information in the text. Let me know if you need me to correct or improve anything!
