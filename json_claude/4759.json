 Unfortunately I do not have access to the input text you referred to in order to create the requested JSON object. If you could provide the relevant text, I would be happy to parse it and generate the JSON. Without any input text, here is an example of the structure you requested with made up data:

{
    "id": "4759", 
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": "John Smith",
            "email": "jsmith@example.com",
            "affiliation": "Example University"
        }
    ],
    "conference": "NICAR", 
    "year": "2022",
    "title": "Example Conference Paper Title",
    "description": "This is a 1-2 sentence summary of the text.",
    "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword3", "keyword4", "keyword5"]
}

Please provide the input text and I will generate the properly formatted JSON object.
