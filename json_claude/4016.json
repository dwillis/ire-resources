 Unfortunately I do not have access to the input text you want me to process. As an AI assistant without that context, I am unable to create the JSON object you described. However, I can explain the general process for creating such a JSON:

1. Read and understand the input text, identifying relevant information like author names, conference, year, etc. 

2. Create a JSON object with the specified keys:
    - "id": 4016
    - "authors": a list of objects, each with "name", "email", and "affiliation"
    - "conference": "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed" 
    - "year": year or "Not Listed"
    - "title": title of the paper/presentation
    - "description": 1-2 sentence summary
    - "keywords": list of relevant terms

3. Populate the values for each key based on information extracted from the input text

4. Ensure all values are in English and enclosed in quotemarks

5. Validate the final JSON structure matches what you asked for

Without the actual input text, I cannot perform these steps. But hopefully this gives you an idea of how I would approach constructing the JSON if I had access to the necessary context. Let me know if you have any other questions!
