 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
  "id": "T2119",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Scott J. Wilson", "email": null, "affiliation": "Los Angeles Times"}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": "Uncovering the Invisible Web",
  "description": "The article discusses various types of web pages and databases that are not indexed by search engines, as well as tools and strategies for finding information in the 'invisible web'.",
  "keywords": ["databases", "search engines", "government data", "audio/video", "directories"]  
}
```

I included the author's name and affiliation since it was provided. The conference and year were not clearly identified, so I put "Not Listed". The description is a concise 2 sentence summary, and the keywords list 5 relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON.
