 Here is the JSON object generated from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5777",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Emilia Diaz-Struck", "email": null, "affiliation": "ICIJ"},
    {"name": "Karrie Kehoe", "email": null, "affiliation": "ICIJ"}, 
    {"name": "Margot Williams", "email": null, "affiliation": "ICIJ"},
    {"name": "Andrew Lehren", "email": null, "affiliation": "NBC News"},
    {"name": "Emily Siegel", "email": null, "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2019",
  "title": "Connecting the dots with health data: The Implant Files case",
  "description": "ICIJ, NBC News, AP and more than 50 media partners examine issues related to medical devices.",
  "keywords": ["ICIJ", "medical devices", "investigation", "health data", "journalism"]
}
```

I included the key information from the text - the conference, year, authors with affiliations, a short description, and relevant keywords. I made up an ID number since none was provided. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON structure!
