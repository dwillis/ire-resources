 Here is the JSON object generated from the input:

  "keywords": [
    "news",
    "interactives",
    "engagement",
    "personalization"
  ]
}
```

I left the author names as null since none were listed. I included the affiliations mentioned in the text. The conference is NICAR since this presentation is for NICAR. The year is not listed. The description summarizes the main points. And I included some relevant keywords about the content.
