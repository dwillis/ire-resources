 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4152",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Hagit Limor",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "WXIX-TV"
    },
    {
      "name": "Phil Drechsler",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "KNBC"
    },
    {
      "name": "Eric Flack",
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "WAVE-TV"
    },
    {
      "name": "Steve Cyrkin",
      "email": "Steve.Cyrkin@autographcollector.com",
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "Tips and information for journalists investigating fraud in the memorabilia and autograph market.",
  "keywords": [
    "fraud",
    "memorabilia", 
    "autographs",
    "forgery",
    "reporting"
  ]
}
```

I extracted the key information from the text to populate the specified JSON structure. The id, conference, year and description were directly specified or inferred. The authors and affiliations were taken from the email addresses. The keywords were selected based on important topics covered in the content.
