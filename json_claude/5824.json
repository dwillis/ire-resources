 Here is the JSON object created from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "5824",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Practical blockchain",
  "description": "A presentation providing an overview of how cryptocurrencies and blockchains work.",
  "keywords": [
    "blockchain",
    "bitcoin",
    "cryptocurrency", 
    "transactions",
    "wallets"
  ]
}
```

I left the author name, email, and affiliation as null since no author information was provided. The conference and year are listed as "Not Listed" since those details were not included. The description provides a 1-2 sentence summary, and keywords are relevant terms from the content.
