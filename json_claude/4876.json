 Here is the JSON object generated from the input text:

      "affiliation": "The Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Consider the source: Building expertise on trauma for better watchdog + investigative reporting",
  "description": "The text discusses how trauma affects the brain and behavior of people who have experienced it, and provides tips for journalists on ethically and sensitively interviewing and reporting on trauma survivors.",
  "keywords": [
    "trauma", 
    "journalism",
    "ethics",
    "interviewing",
    "reporting"
  ]
}
```

I left the author name and email as null since no names were listed. I used "The Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma" as the affiliation since it was referenced in the text. The conference, year, and title were listed as "Not Listed" since that information was not clearly provided. The description is a concise 2 sentence summary of the key points. And the keywords are relevant terms related to the main topics, limited to 5 not including conference and authors.
