 Unfortunately I do not have enough context in the provided text to fully construct the requested JSON object. The text does not clearly identify a conference, year, title, or description. Based on the limited information, here is an attempt at a partial JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "T1986",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": []
}
```

I would need more information in the text, such as a title, date, conference name, etc. to accurately populate the requested keys. Please provide a text with richer metadata and I would be happy to construct the full JSON object.
