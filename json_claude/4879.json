 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
  "id": "4879",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Shaun Assael", "email": null, "affiliation": "ESPN"},
    {"name": "John Diedrich", "email": null, "affiliation": "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel"}, 
    {"name": "Steve Riley", "email": null, "affiliation": "The News & Observer"},
    {"name": "Kevin Merida", "email": null, "affiliation": "ESPN"}
  ],
  "conference": "IRE", 
  "year": "2016",
  "title": null,
  "description": "Tips and strategies for conducting effective sports investigations and stories.",
  "keywords": ["backgrounding", "records", "sources", "planning", "writing"]  
}
```

I extracted the conference name and year from the first line. The authors and affiliations were taken from the listed panelists. The description summarizes the overall content. And I selected 5 relevant keywords from the tips.
