 Here is the JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "4641",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null, 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "",
  "keywords": []
}
```

I've left most values as null or empty since the input did not contain any text to summarize. Please let me know if you would like me to attempt creating a JSON object from any specific text you provide.
