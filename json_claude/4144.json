 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4144",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Meg Kissinger",
      "email": "mkissinger@jrn.com",
      "affiliation": "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Tips for investigating caregivers",
  "description": "The text provides tips for journalists investigating issues related to caregivers and care facilities.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigating",
    "caregivers",
    "nursing homes",
    "hospitals",
    "reporting"
  ]
}
```

I extracted the only clear author name, email and affiliation. Since no conference or year is mentioned, I put "Not Listed" for those fields. The description is a short 1-2 sentence summary of the main content. And the keywords list contains a few relevant terms related to the subject matter.
