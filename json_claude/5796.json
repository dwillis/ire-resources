 Here is the JSON object created from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "5796",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Ranjani Chakraborty",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "vox.com"
    },
    {
      "name": "Blake Nelson", 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "njadvancemedia.com"
    },
    {
      "name": "Hilke Schellmann",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "nyu.edu"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Bring your investigative reporting to life using animation and illustrations",
  "description": "Tipsheet on how to create animations and illustrations to visualize investigative reporting.",
  "keywords": [
    "animation",
    "illustrations",
    "investigative reporting",
    "visualizations",
    "storytelling"
  ]
}
```

I summarized the key information from the text into the required JSON format with the requested keys and attributes. The id is set to 5796. The authors list contains names and affiliations extracted from the signatures. Email is left as null since none are provided. The conference and year are "Not Listed" since no specific conference or year is mentioned. The description is a 2 sentence summary of the main topic. Finally, the keywords list contains 5 relevant terms related to the content.
