 Here is the JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "T1790",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "MaryJo Sylwester", "email": "msylwester@usatoday.com", "affiliation": "USA TODAY"},
    {"name": "Anthony DeBarros", "email": "adebarros@usatoday.com", "affiliation": "USA TODAY"},
    {"name": "Nancy Stancill", "email": "nstancill@charlotteobserver.com", "affiliation": "Charlotte Observer"}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2003",
  "title": "Applying CAR to non-metro beats",
  "description": "Tips for computer-assisted reporting for journalists covering non-metro areas.",
  "keywords": ["data", "sources", "databases", "watchdog", "projects"]
}
```

I summarized the key points about using data sources and building databases for non-metro reporting into a short description, and extracted a few salient terms for keywords. Let me know if you would like me to modify or improve the JSON object in any way!
