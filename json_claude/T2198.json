 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "T2198",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "David Schechter", "email": null, "affiliation": "WCCO-TV"}
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2004", 
  "title": null,
  "description": "Background information and advice regarding coverage of Native American casinos and tribal membership issues.",
  "keywords": ["casinos", "gambling", "tribes", "membership", "regulation"]  
}
```

To summarize the key points:

- The conference is IRE based on the header 
- The year 2004 comes from the date 9/10/2004
