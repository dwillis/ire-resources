 Unfortunately there is not enough information in the text provided to create a full JSON object with all the requested keys. Here is my best attempt:

```json
{
  "id": "5900",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text discusses ways journalists can engage audiences to aid investigations.",
  "keywords": [
    "audience",
    "investigations",
    "journalism"
  ]
}
```

I've included placeholder null values where information was not provided, and made my best guess at a short description summarizing the main topic. The conference, year, title, and author details are listed as "Not Listed" since those specifics were not included. The keywords are broad terms related to the general subject matter. Please let me know if you have any other questions!
