 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "3351",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "MaryJo Webster", "email": null, "affiliation": "St. Paul Pioneer Press"},
    {"name": "David Heath", "email": null, "affiliation": "Huffington Post Investigative Fund"}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Juggling and managing CAR work",
  "description": "Tips for reporters and editors on managing time and resources to produce computer-assisted reporting stories while also covering daily beats.",
  "keywords": ["time management", "efficiency", "collaboration", "productivity", "organization"]
}
```

I made assumptions where information was missing, like leaving email and affiliation null when not provided. The conference is listed as "NICAR" since the text references CAR (computer-assisted reporting) and the author affiliations are investigative journalism outlets. The year is "Not Listed" since a specific conference year is not given. The description summarizes the main topics covered, and keywords highlight the major themes.
