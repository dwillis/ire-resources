 Here is the JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "4907",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Judy Fahys",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "kuer.org"
    },
    {
      "name": "Howard Berkes", 
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "npr.org"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Loosen Lips: A Tip Sheet for Investigative Interviews",
  "description": "Tips for conducting effective investigative interviews to obtain truthful information.",
  "keywords": [
    "interviewing", 
    "reporting",
    "sourcing",
    "verification",
    "listening"
  ] 
}
```

I created the JSON format you requested with the necessary keys, set id to 4907, and included author names, email, and affiliations based on the text. Since no conference or year is clearly listed, I put "Not Listed" for those values. The description summarizes the main purpose of the text. Finally, I included 5 relevant keywords excluding conference, authors, and based on the content.
