 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "2301",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Chris Bragg", "email": null, "affiliation": "The Buffalo News"}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "A reporter provides tips on using a 'constructive denial' appeal to speed up responses to Freedom of Information Law requests from New York state agencies.",
  "keywords": ["FOIL", "requests", "New York", "appeals", "delays"]  
}
```

I included the key details from the text - the author name and affiliation, a summary description, the fact that no conference or year is listed, and some relevant keywords. I left some attributes like email and title null since they were not provided. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON!
