 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4018",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "NBC"}
  ],
  "conference": "IRE", 
  "year": "2014",
  "title": "Finding Data for Investigative Reporters",
  "description": "A presentation given at the 2014 IRE Watchdog Workshop in New York about finding data sources and search tools for investigative reporters.",
  "keywords": ["data", "search", "tools", "investigative", "reporting"]  
}
```

I included the affiliation "NBC" since Timothy Sandler from NBC is listed as an author. The conference is "IRE" and the year "2014" based on the text. The description is a 1-2 sentence summary, and I chose 5 relevant keywords from the content. Let me know if you need any changes to this JSON or have additional requirements!
