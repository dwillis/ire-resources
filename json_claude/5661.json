 Here is a JSON object generated from the input text:

{
  "id": "5661",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "",
  "description": "The text discusses strategies for crafting effective public records requests, handling denials and delays, and utilizing resources from the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.",
  "keywords": [
    "public records",
    "FOIA",
    "requests",
    "denials",
    "delays"
  ]
}

I left the author name, email, and affiliation null since no authors were listed. The conference and year are "Not Listed" since those details were not provided. The description is a 2 sentence summary of the key points. The keywords list 5 relevant terms related to the topic that are not conference names or author names.
