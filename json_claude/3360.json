 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the text:

```json
{
  "id": 3360,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Missouri School of Journalism"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Public-worker overtime",
  "description": "The text discusses how to investigate public worker overtime.",
  "keywords": [
    "overtime", 
    "public workers",
    "payroll",
    "hours"
  ]
}
```

I left the author name, email, and affiliation mostly blank since no author was listed, but I put the university name as the affiliation. The conference, year, and some other fields are set to "Not Listed" since that information did not seem to be contained in the text. The description is my own 1-2 sentence summary, and the keywords list contains a few relevant terms.
