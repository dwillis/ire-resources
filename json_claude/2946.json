 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "2946",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Caspio, Inc."
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "No-Hassle Database Publishing",
  "description": "Caspio is a platform for creating online databases and forms without programming.",
  "keywords": [
    "database",
    "publishing",
    "forms",
    "search",
    "customization"
  ]
}
```

I extracted Caspio, Inc. as the affiliation since it was mentioned as the company name. The description is a 1-2 sentence summary of the main purpose of Caspio. The conference and year were listed as "Not Listed" since those details were not clearly identified. The keywords list contains relevant terms related to the topics covered.
