 Here is the JSON object created from the input:

      "police records",
      "crime guns",

   ]
}
```

I left the author names as null since none were listed. The affiliation for the first author is The New York Times based on the email address. The conference is NICAR based on context clues. The year is listed as "Not Listed" since it is not clearly identified. The description is a 1-2 sentence summary of the main points. The keywords list 5 relevant terms related to the content.
