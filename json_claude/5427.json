 Unfortunately I do not have access to the original text you referenced, so I cannot generate the exact JSON object you described. However, here is an example JSON object with that structure:

```json
{
  "id": "5427",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "John Smith",
      "email": "jsmith@newsorg.com",
      "affiliation": "News Organization"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "2016",
  "title": "Data journalism techniques",
  "description": "This session covered various data journalism techniques.",
  "keywords": ["data", "journalism", "reporting"] 
}
```

I included fictional sample data to demonstrate the structure you requested. The keys are enclosed in quotations, authors is a list of objects, and the description is a short 1-2 sentence summary. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional example text you can provide so I can try generating the JSON again with real data.
