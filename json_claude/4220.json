 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4220",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Wall Street Journal"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "This Wonâ€™t Hurt a Bit",
  "description": "Tips for researching the origins of a medical device that may have caused harm to patients.",
  "keywords": [
    "medical device", 
    "patient harm",
    "research tips",
    "origin story"
  ]
}
```

I left the author name as null since it was not clearly listed, used the Wall Street Journal as the affiliation since that was mentioned, and put "Not Listed" for the conference and year since those details were not clearly provided. The description is a 1-2 sentence summary, and the keywords cover some of the main topics without going over 5 terms.
