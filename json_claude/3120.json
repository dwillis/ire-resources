 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "3120",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Jim Steele", 
      "email": "Jim_Steele@comcast.net",
      "affiliation": "Vanity Fair"
    },
    {
      "name": "Joe Stephens",
      "email": "stephensj@washpost.com",
      "affiliation": "The Washington Post"
    },
    {
      "name": "Mike McGraw",
      "email": "mcgraw@kcstar.com",
      "affiliation": "The Kansas City Star"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2008",
  "title": "Unsung Documents",
  "description": "Experienced investigative journalists share tips for finding and using overlooked public documents to uncover stories.",
  "keywords": [
    "documents",
    "investigative journalism",
    "FOIA",
    "public records"
  ]
}
```

I extracted the conference name, year, and author details from the text. The description is a short 1-2 sentence summary, and the keywords list relevant terms excluding the conference and authors.
