 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input:

{
  "id": "4375",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null, 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": []
}

I left many of the values as null since there was no input text provided to extract information from. If sample text is provided, I would be happy to attempt extracting the requested information to populate the JSON object. Please let me know if you would like me to try with some sample input text.
