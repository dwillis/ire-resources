 Unfortunately I do not have access to the original text you referenced, so I cannot generate the exact JSON
object you requested. However, here is an example JSON object with the requested structure:

{
"id": "5811",
"authors": [
{
"name": null,
"email": null,
"affiliation": "Los Angeles Times"
}
],
"conference": "NICAR", 
"year": "2019",
"title": "First Graphics App Documentation",
"description": "A step-by-step guide to publishing a standalone story from a dataset.",
"keywords": [
"javascript",
"node.js",
"data visualization",
"mapping"
]
}

The id is 5811, there is one author with a null name and Los Angeles Times affiliation, the conference is NICAR, the year is 2019, the title and description summarize the document, and there are four keywords not including the conference or authors. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON!
