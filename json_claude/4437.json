 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the text:

```json
{
  "id": "4437",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Palm Beach Post"
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Atlanta Journal-Constitution"
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "BBC News"
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Georgia News Lab"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR15",
  "year": "2015",
  "title": "Editing the Data Story",
  "description": "A panel discussion on launching, bulletproofing and presenting data stories.",
  "keywords": [
    "Editing", 
    "Data",
    "Story",
    "Presentation",
    "Reporting"
  ]
}
```

I set the conference to "NICAR15" based on the text, extracted author affiliations when available, and summarized the text into a short description. I also included 5 relevant keywords. Let me know if you need any clarification or have suggestions for improvement!
