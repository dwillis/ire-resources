 Here is the JSON object:

```json

  "id": "5823",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "inewsource"},
    {"name": "Matt Clark", "email": null, "affiliation": "Newsday"},
    {"name": "Aaron Terrazas", "email": null, "affiliation": "Zillow"}, 
    {"name": "Jon Schleuss", "email": null, "affiliation": "L.A. Times"}
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Housing Investigations",
  "description": "Property tax data can benefit housing investigations.",
  "keywords": ["property tax", "housing", "investigations", "data"]  
}
```

I parsed the text to identify the authors and their affiliations where available. The conference is IRE based on the slides URL. The year is not listed, so I put "Not Listed". The description summarizes that property tax data can benefit housing investigations. The keywords list relevant terms from the text.
