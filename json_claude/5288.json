 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input:

```json
{
    "id": 5288,
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": null,
            "email": null, 
            "affiliation": "Center for Data Journalism Nepal"
        }
    ],
    "conference": "IRE",
    "year": "Not Listed",
    "title": "Easy, free online dataviz tool",
    "description": "Storymapjs is a free tool to help you tell stories on the web that highlight the locations of a series of events.",
    "keywords": [
        "dataviz",
        "mapping", 
        "storytelling",
        "timeline",
        "events"
    ]
}
```

I set the id to 5288 as requested. There was no author name listed, so I left name as null. Email and affiliation were also null since no organizational affiliation was provided, but I put "Center for Data Journalism Nepal" as the affiliation based on the Twitter handle. The conference was listed as IRE. No year was given so I put "Not Listed". The title was taken directly as the tweet text at the start. The description is a 1-2 sentence summary of the overall content. And I chose 5 relevant keywords to describe the tool and its capabilities.

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON!
