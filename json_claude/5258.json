 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5258",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Nathan Halverson",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Reveal"
    },
    {
      "name": "Brant Houston",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "University of Illinois"
    },
    {
      "name": "Mike McGraw",
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "Kansas City Public Television"
    },
    {
      "name": "Pam Dempsey",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigating the Global Food System",
  "description": "Experienced investigative journalists discuss reporting on issues related to the global food system, agribusiness, and related topics.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative",
    "reporting",
    "food",
    "agriculture",
    "business"
  ]
}
```

To summarize:

- Extracted author names, left email and affiliation null if not provided
- Conference not explicitly listed, so put "Not Listed"
- No year listed, so put "Not Listed"
- Generated a short 1-2 sentence description 
- Extracted 5 relevant keywords excluding conference and authors

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON!
