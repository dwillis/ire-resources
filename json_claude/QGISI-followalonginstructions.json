 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the text:

```json
{
  "id": "followalonginstructions",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": null},
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2017",
  "title": "QGIS I - workshop, Nicar 2017",
  "description": "QGIS is a powerful and complex piece of software but journalists can get excellent results from a couple of relatively simple functions.",
  "keywords": [
    "QGIS", 
    "mapping",
    "data visualization",
    "journalism",
    "workshop"
  ]
}
```
