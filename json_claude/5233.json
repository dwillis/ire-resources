 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
  "id": "5233",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Pat Beall", "email": null, "affiliation": "The Palm Beach Post"},
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "The Palm Beach Post"}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Humanizing the heroin crisis",
  "description": "Tips for using public records and interviews with families to write profiles of people who have died in the opioid epidemic.",
  "keywords": ["heroin", "opioids", "addiction", "profiles", "obituaries"] 
}
```

I extracted the one clear author name "Pat Beall" and used the affiliation "The Palm Beach Post" which is mentioned in the text. The other author is unspecified. The conference and year are not clearly stated, so I put "NICAR" since this seems like a conference presentation and "Not Listed" for the year. The description summarizes the main topic, and the keywords list some of the key terms that capture the themes.
