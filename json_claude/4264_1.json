 Unfortunately I do not have enough context to generate a full JSON object from your instructions. If you could provide the text you would like me to analyze and summarize, I would be happy to create the JSON object with the requested keys and attributes. Without any input text, the best I can do is provide an example JSON skeleton:

```json
{
  "id": "4264_1",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "",
  "description": "", 
  "keywords": [
    "",
    "",
    "",
    "",
    ""
  ]
}
```

Please provide the text you would like summarized and I will populate the JSON with the requested information.
