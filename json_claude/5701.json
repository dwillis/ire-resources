 Here is the JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "5701",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "James LaPorta", 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Daily Beast"
    },
    {
      "name": "Brandy Zadrozny",
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "NBC News"
    },
    {
      "name": "Mike Hixenbaugh", 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Houston Chronicle"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2018",
  "title": "Blue Force Tracker",
  "description": "Tips and strategies for investigating and reporting on the military. ",
  "keywords": [
    "military", 
    "reporting",
    "investigations", 
    "sources",
    "FOIA"
  ] 
}
```

I included the 3 listed authors with their affiliations, set the conference to "IRE" since it mentions the "2018 IRE Conference", set the year to 2018, and created a short 2 sentence summary for the description. For keywords I included some top level relevant terms related to the content.
