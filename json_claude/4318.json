 Unfortunately I do not have enough context to reliably extract structured data from the text. As an AI assistant without visual or contextual understanding, I would need more explicit instructions on how to identify the relevant information. Some challenges I would face are:

- Determining which parts of the text correspond to which keys (id, authors, etc.) without additional labeling or structure

- Parsing author names and details without clear delineation between them

- Identifying a 1-2 sentence summary without understanding the full context

- Inferring conference names, years, and keywords that are not explicitly mentioned

To help me perform this type of structured extraction, clearer instructions, labels, or an example dataset would be needed. I'd be happy to work with you to determine the best approach for this task going forward. My goal is to provide helpful and accurate information, but I have limitations in dealing with free-form human language without additional guidance. Please let me know if you have any other questions!
