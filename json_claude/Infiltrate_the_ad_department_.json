 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "Infiltrate_the_ad_department_",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null 
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The author describes creating a mobile advertising system for a news organization to increase engagement and revenue without annoying readers.",
  "keywords": [
    "mobile",
    "ads", 
    "engagement",
    "revenue", 
    "readers"
  ]
}
```

I left the author name, email, and affiliation null since no authors were listed. The conference and year are "Not Listed" since those details were not provided. The title is also left null since there did not seem to be a clear title. The description summarizes the key points in a simple sentence, and the keywords list some of the main topics covered without repeating the conference or authors.
