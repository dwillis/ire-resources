 Here is the JSON object based on the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5275",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Angela Hill", "email": null, "affiliation": "Scripps Washington Bureau"},
    {"name": "Jodie Fleischer", "email": null, "affiliation": "WRC-TV"},
    {"name": "Jeremy Rogalski", "email": null, "affiliation": "KHOU-TV"}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Rolling Out the Big Investigation",
  "description": "Tips for planning and executing an in-depth investigative news story.",
  "keywords": ["investigative reporting", "story planning", "partnerships", "digital strategy", "social media"]  
}
```

I summarized the main points into a description, extracted the author details, and selected 5 representative keywords. The conference and year were not listed, so I put "Not Listed" for those values.
