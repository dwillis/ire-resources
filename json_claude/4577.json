 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4577",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Danielle Ivory",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The New York Times"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": "The Anatomy of an Auto Safety Recall",
  "description": "The article discusses sources for investigating auto recalls, including government databases and reports from automakers.",
  "keywords": [
    "autos",
    "recalls", 
    "defects",
    "investigations",
    "statistics"
  ]
}
```

I included the author's name and affiliation from the email signature. Since no conference or year is listed, I put "Not Listed" for those fields. The description summarizes the main topic. And the keywords list some relevant terms related to the content.
