 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
  "id": "5409",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Hilke Schellmann",
      "email": "hilke.schellmann@nyu.edu",
      "affiliation": null
    },
    {
      "name": "Susie Cagle",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null 
    },
    {
     "name": "Ranjani Chakraborty",
     "email": "ranjani.chakraborty@vox.com",
     "affiliation": "Vox"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Bring your investigative reporting to life using animation and comics",
  "description": "Tips on using animation and comics to tell investigative stories.",
  "keywords": ["animation", "comics", "investigative reporting", "visual storytelling"]
}
```

I included the key information from the text like the author names, one author's email and affiliation, summarized the main topic in the description, and listed relevant keywords. Since no specific conference or year was mentioned, I put "Not Listed" for those values. The id is hardcoded to 5409 as requested.
