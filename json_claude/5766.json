 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
    "id": 5766,
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": "Mark Hansen",
            "email": "markh@columbia.edu",
            "affiliation": "Columbia Journalism School"
        },
        {
            "name": "Gerson Vasquez",
            "affiliation": "U. S. Census Bureau"
        },
        {
            "name": "Hansi Lo Wang",
            "email": "hwang@npr.org", 
            "affiliation": "NPR News"
        },
        {
            "name": "Jodi Upton",
            "email": "jupton@syr.edu",
            "affiliation": "Syracuse University"
        }
    ],
    "conference": "Not Listed",
    "year": "Not Listed",
    "title": "Covering the 2020 Census",
    "description": "A panel discussion offering tips for reporting on the 2020 United States census.",
    "keywords": ["census", "reporting", "tips", "mistakes", "demographics"]
}
```

I included the key details from the text like the author names and affiliations, made up a 1-2 sentence summary for the description, put "Not Listed" for the conference and year since those details were not provided, and listed 5 relevant keywords related to the census and reporting on it. Let me know if you need any changes to this JSON object!
