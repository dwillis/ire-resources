 Here is the JSON object created from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5755",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "MaryJo Webster", "email": null, "affiliation": "Star Tribune"},
    {"name": "Jaimi Dowdell", "email": null, "affiliation": "Reuters"}, 
    {"name": "Rob Barry", "email": null, "affiliation": "Wall Street Journal"}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "Tipsheet with advice on researching data before making a request, questions to ask about the data, tips on wording requests, and additional resources.",
  "keywords": ["research", "questions", "requests", "tips", "resources"]
}
```

I set the conference to "NICAR" since that was mentioned, and year to "Not Listed" since no specific year was given. The title was left null since none was provided. The description is a short summary of the key info in the text. The keywords list contains relevant topical terms excluding conference, authors, and years.
