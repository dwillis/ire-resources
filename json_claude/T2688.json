 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "T2688",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Seth Borenstein", "email": null, "affiliation": "Associated Press"},
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "Knight Ridder Newspapers"}, 
    {"name": "Linda J. Johnson", "email": null, "affiliation": "Lexington Herald-Leader"},
    {"name": "Lee Mueller", "email": null, "affiliation": "Lexington Herald-Leader"}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2006",
  "title": "Investigating Workplace Safety",
  "description": "A presentation on investigating federal mine safety enforcement during the Bush administration and findings of fewer and smaller fines and less staff.",
  "keywords": ["mining", "workplace safety", "enforcement", "fines"]
}
```

I extracted the key information from the text to populate the specified JSON structure. The affiliation uses news organizations when mentioned. The description summarizes the main topic. And the keywords list relevant terms without the conference or author information.
