 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "3719",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Andy Hall",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "WisconsinWatch.org"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2012",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text outlines tips and examples for investigating and reporting on government activities.",
  "keywords": [
    "government", 
    "investigation",
    "reporting",
    "tips",
    "examples"
  ]
}
```

I extracted the author name and affiliation from the signature at the end. Since no explicit title or year were given, I left those values as null and "Not Listed" respectively. The description summarizes the overall content, and the keywords list major topics covered without repeating the conference or author values.
