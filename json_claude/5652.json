 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5652",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "BuzzFeed"
    },
    {
      "name": null, 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Holland & Knight"
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Malheur Enterprise" 
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "USA TODAY"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "WIN YOUR FOIA APPEALS",
  "description": "The text provides tips and sample language for making effective appeals when Freedom of Information Act requests are denied.",
  "keywords": [
    "FOIA",
    "appeals",
    "exemptions",
    "privacy",
    "investigations"
  ]
}
```

I left the author names as null since none were provided. I included the news organizations mentioned as affiliations. The conference and year were not clearly stated, so I put default values. The description is a short summary, and the keywords list several topics covered without duplicating the conference or authors information.
