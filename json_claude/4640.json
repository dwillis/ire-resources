 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
  "id": "4640",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Katie Wilcox", "email": null, "affiliation": null},
    {"name": "Chris Koeberl", "email": null, "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": "Cannabis Reporting",
  "description": "Guide for reporters on covering the cannabis industry and related issues in Colorado, which has legalized recreational marijuana.",
  "keywords": ["cannabis", "marijuana", "Colorado", "reporting", "industry"]
}
```

I included the two author names that were listed, left email and affiliation null since those details were not provided. The conference and year were listed as "Not Listed" since those details were not clearly identified in the text. The description is a 1-2 sentence summary, and the keywords list contains 5 relevant terms related to the content.
