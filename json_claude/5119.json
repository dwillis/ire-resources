 Unfortunately I do not have access to the original text you referred to in order to create the JSON object. If you could provide the text or a link to it, I would be happy to parse it and create the JSON object with the requested keys and attributes. Without the source text I am unable to populate the object's values accurately. Please let me know if you can share the text, and I appreciate you understanding that an AI assistant requires source materials in order to complete content-related tasks.
