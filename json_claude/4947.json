 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
  "id": "4947",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "AJC Newsroom"},
    {"name": "Lois Norder", "email": null, "affiliation": null},
    {"name": "Brad Schrade", "email": null, "affiliation": null},
    {"name": "John Perry", "email": null, "affiliation": null},
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "The Oklahoman"}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": "Watchdogging on the Beat",
  "description": "Tips from journalists on how to find and pursue investigative stories while covering a beat.",
  "keywords": ["investigative reporting", "beat reporting", "public records"]  
}
```

I extracted the authors where listed, used the news organization names as affiliations where available, summarized the main topic, and listed the conference and year as "Not Listed" since those details were not clearly provided. The keywords list some of the main themes without the conference name or author details.
