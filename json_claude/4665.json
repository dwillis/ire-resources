 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the text:

```json
{
  "id": "4665",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "datamade.us"
    },
    {
     "name": "Cathy Deng",
     "email": null,
     "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "2016",
  "title": "Advanced data cleaning with Python: machine learning techniques",
  "description": "A hands-on session to learn about using machine learning for data cleaning with the dedupe and usaddress Python libraries.",
  "keywords": [
    "data cleaning",
    "dedupe",
    "usaddress",
    "machine learning",
    "Python"
  ]
}
```

I set the conference to "NICAR" and the year to "2016" based on the text. The authors include the presenter affiliation datamade.us since it's mentioned, and I was able to find the name Cathy Deng as a presenter. The title, description, and keywords are based on my own interpretation and summarization of the key information in the text. Let me know if you need me to correct or improve anything!
