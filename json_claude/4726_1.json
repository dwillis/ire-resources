 Here is the JSON object for the input:

{
  "id": "4726_1",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Untitled",
  "description": "No description given.",
  "keywords": []
}

I left most values as null or empty since no text was provided as input. Please provide the text you would like analyzed and I will update the JSON object.
