 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
  "id": "4049",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "VG"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Criminal Norway",
  "description": "Combining numbers, interactivity, news journalism and feature storytelling.",
  "keywords": [
    "Criminal data",
    "Census data",
    "Political data",
    "Income data"
  ] 
}
```

I made the description a brief 1-2 sentence summary of the main topic. The conference and year are "Not Listed" since those details are not provided. The only affiliation mentioned is VG, which I included for the sole author. The keywords list several types of data that seem relevant based on the images and text.
