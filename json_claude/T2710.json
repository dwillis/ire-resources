 Here is the JSON object:

```json

    "id": "T2710",
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": "David Kirby",
            "email": "dkirby@nyc.rr.com",
            "affiliation": null
        }
    ],
    "conference": "IRE",
    "year": "2006",
    "title": "TIPS FOR REPORTING ON VACCINES, MERCURY AND AUTISM",
    "description": "Tips for journalists reporting on the potential link between vaccines, mercury, and autism, including lists of key researchers and organizations on different sides of the debate.",
    "keywords": [
        "vaccines", 
        "mercury", 
        "autism", 
        "thimerosal", 
        "journalism"
    ]
}
```

I included David Kirby as the sole author since he is the only one explicitly listed. The conference is "IRE" and the year "2006" based on the context. The title and keywords are drawn directly from the text. The description summarizes the overall content.
