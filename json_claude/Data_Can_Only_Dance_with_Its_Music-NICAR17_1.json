 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "NICAR17_1",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Tom Johnson", "email": null, "affiliation": "Inst. for Analytic Journalism"},
    {"name": "Carli Brosseau", "email": null, "affiliation": "The Oregonian"}, 
    {"name": "Andy Lehren", "email": null, "affiliation": "The New York Times"}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2017",
  "title": "Data Can Only Dance with Its Music: Understanding the ecology of public data",
  "description": "A presentation on strategies for requesting public data and related metadata through freedom of information laws.",
  "keywords": ["FOIA", "metadata", "strategies", "public records"]
}
```

I set the conference name to "NICAR", year to "2017" based on context clues, created a 1-2 sentence description, and listed 5 relevant keywords. The authors are linked to their affiliations from the text. All other attributes are set to null when no clear value is available.
