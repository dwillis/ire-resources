 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the text:

{
  "id": "3345",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Essential SQL Queries (To Me, At Least)",
  "description": "The author shares five SQL queries that he finds essential based on his experience coding in SQL Server and MySQL.",
  "keywords": ["SQL", "queries", "coding", "journalism"]  
}
