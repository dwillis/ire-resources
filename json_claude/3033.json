 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "3033",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Holly Hacker", "email": null, "affiliation": "Dallas Morning News"},
    {"name": "Stan Ketterer", "email": null, "affiliation": "Oklahoma State University"}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Basic Math Skills",
  "description": "A guide to using basic mathematical concepts and formulas for calculating percentages, rates, averages and sampling error in news reporting.",
  "keywords": ["math", "statistics", "journalism", "reporting"] 
}
```

I included the key information from the input like the author names and affiliations, left the conference and year as "Not Listed" since it was not clearly provided, summarized the overall purpose in the description, and chose some relevant keywords. Let me know if you need me to modify or add anything to this JSON object.
