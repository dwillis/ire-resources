 Here is the JSON object created from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": 3257,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "USA TODAY"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2009,
  "title": "Web Scraping",
  "description": "The text discusses web scraping, which involves extracting data from websites for analysis.",
  "keywords": ["scraping", "data", "websites", "tools", "legal"]  
}
```

I extracted the conference name, author affiliation, year, and created a title and description. The keywords list the main topics covered. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON!
