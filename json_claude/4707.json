 Unfortunately I do not have enough context to generate the full JSON object you described. To create an accurate JSON representation, I would need the original text or document that contains the author names, conference details, etc. If you could provide those source materials, I would be happy to parse the information and generate the JSON object with the requested structure. Please let me know if you can share the original text or document, and I apologize that I cannot fully complete the task without those additional details.
