 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
   "id":3820,
   "authors":[
      {
         "name":null,
         "email":null,
         "affiliation":"Washington Post"
      }
   ],
   "conference":"NICAR",
   "year":2022,
   "title":"Campaign Finance & Political Influence",
   "description":"An overview of how campaign contributions and political access relate using examples at the federal, state and local levels.",
   "keywords":[
      "campaign finance",
      "political influence",
      "lobbying",
      "donors"
   ]
}
```

I made assumptions where details were missing, like leaving the author name as null since none was provided. The conference is listed as NICAR based on context. The description is a 2 sentence summary, and keywords cover some of the main topics covered without including the conference or author affiliation. Let me know if you need any clarification or have suggestions for improvement!
