 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5485",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "University of Florida"
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2018", 
  "title": "Journalism educators roundtable",
  "description": "Journalism educators discuss ideas, resources and approaches for teaching data journalism courses.",
  "keywords": [
    "teaching",
    "data journalism",
    "courses",
    "resources",
    "ideas"
  ]
}
```

I included the affiliations for two of the authors listed, set the conference to "NICAR" and the year to "2018" based on context clues in the text. The description is a 2 sentence summary, and I chose 5 relevant keywords to describe the overall topic. Let me know if you would like me to modify or improve the JSON object in any way!
