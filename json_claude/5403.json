 Unfortunately there is not enough context in the provided response to generate a comprehensive JSON object as described. To create an accurate JSON object, more complete source data would be needed, ideally containing clear identifiers for id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. With the limited information provided, here is a basic attempt:

```json
{
  "id": "5403",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "A 1-2 sentence summary was not possible due to lack of context.",
  "keywords": []
}
```

I tried to follow the instructions to the best of my ability based on the input provided, but without more complete source data, the JSON object is limited in its accuracy and completeness. Please provide clearer sample input if you would like a more robust JSON object generated.
