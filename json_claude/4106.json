 Unfortunately there is not enough context in the provided text to create a detailed JSON object with all the requested keys. The text appears to be an incomplete snippet without clear attribution, authors, conference details etc. Here is my best attempt at constructing a partial JSON object based on the limited information available:

```json
{
  "id": "4106",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null 
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text discusses the concept of visual journalism and providing contextualized data visualization around a healthcare issue.",
  "keywords": [
    "visual", 
    "journalism",
    "data",
    "visualization",
    "healthcare"
  ]
}
```

I've included placeholder values for the keys requested, but left most values as null or generics since clear attributed details are not present. Please let me know if you have any other text snippets with more complete information to construct a richer JSON object.
