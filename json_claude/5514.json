 Unfortunately I do not have access to the full text you referenced, so I cannot extract all the requested information. Based on the details provided, here is an attempt at the JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "5514",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": []
}
```

I left most of the values as null since I could not extract the actual information from a text. Please let me know if you have any other questions!
