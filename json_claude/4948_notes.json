 Here is the JSON object:

```json

      "name": "Julia Angwin",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "ProPublica"
    },
    {
      "name": "Sam Corbett-Davies",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    },
    {

    }, 
    {
      "name": "Greg Linch",

    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Algorithmic accountability panel",
  "description": "A panel discussion on investigating and reporting on algorithms that impact people's lives.",
  "keywords": [
    "algorithms",
    "bias", 
    "transparency",
    "investigations",
    "accountability"
  ]
}
```

I summarized the key details from the text into a JSON format with the requested structure and fields. The description is a high-level 1-2 sentence summary. The keywords list what I judged to be 5 of the most relevant topics from the content. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON.
