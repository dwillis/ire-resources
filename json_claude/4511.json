 Here is the JSON object created from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4511",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Deborah Nelson", "email": null, "affiliation": "Reuters"},
    {"name": "Ryan McNeill", "email": null, "affiliation": "Reuters"},
    {"name": "Duff Wilson", "email": null, "affiliation": "Reuters"}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "TIP SHEET FOR REAL-TIME REPORTING ON RISING SEA LEVELS",
  "description": "Tips for journalists on finding evidence of rising sea levels and their impact in local communities.",
  "keywords": ["sea level rise", "flooding", "tides", "erosion", "climate change"]
}
```

I summarized the key points about the text - that it provides tips for journalists on finding evidence of rising sea levels and flooding in local communities. I set the conference to NICAR since the text came from their website. The year was not listed, authors are from Reuters, and I chose 5 relevant keywords.
