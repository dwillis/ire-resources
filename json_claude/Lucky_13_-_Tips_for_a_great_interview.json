 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "_Tips_for_a_great_interview",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Marisa Kwiatkowski", "email": null, "affiliation": "@IndyMarisaK"},
    {"name": "Mike Rezendes", "email": null, "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "LUCKY 13\nTips for a good\ninterview",
  "description": "Tips and advice for conducting a good interview from two journalists.",
  "keywords": ["tips", "advice", "interview", "journalism", "sources"]  
}
```

I included the top-level title as the title, used the number 13 in the title to summarize the number of tips, and created a short description summarizing the content. The conference, year, and some author details were not available so I put "Not Listed". The keywords summarize some of the main topics covered in the tips.
