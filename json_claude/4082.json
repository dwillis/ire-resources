 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
  "id": "4082",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Washington Times"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": null,
  "description": "The article discusses trends in gender ratios and differences between men and women.",
  "keywords": [
    "gender",
    "demographics",
    "trends"
  ]
}
```

I left the title as null since a clear title was not provided. The description summarizes the key points about gender differences and trends. The keywords capture some of the main themes. The conference, year, and detailed author info were not clearly specified, so I put standard values for those.
