 Unfortunately the text provided does not contain structured data to populate all the requested JSON fields. Based on the information available, here is an attempt at creating the JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "3284",
  "authors": [
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "Text provides information and links related to investigating companies, people, documents, and public records.",
  "keywords": ["investigating", "research", "documents", "links"] 
}
```

I've left some fields like authors and title null since clear values were not present. The description is a short summary, and keywords reflect main topics covered without including the conference or authors. Please let me know if you would like me to modify anything in this JSON structure based on the information provided!
