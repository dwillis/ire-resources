 Here is the JSON object created from the input:

```json
{
   "id": "3792",
   "authors": [
      {
         "name": null,
         "email": null,
         "affiliation": null  
      }
   ],
   "conference": "Not Listed", 
   "year": "Not Listed",
   "title": null,
   "description": "There be dragons. Avoid stats pitfalls.",
   "keywords": []
}
```

I left most fields empty or with default values since there was no clear input text provided to extract data from. The description summarizes the only real text provided ("There be dragons. Avoid stats pitfalls.") Please provide sample input text if you would like a more fully populated JSON object.
