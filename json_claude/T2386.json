 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

{
    "id": "T2386",
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": null,
            "email": null,
            "affiliation": "Chicago Tribune"
        }
    ],
    "conference": "NICAR",
    "year": "Not Listed",
    "title": "A Guide to Reading Financial Reports",
    "description": "This text provides a guide to reading and understanding financial reports filed by publicly traded companies, including key SEC forms and documents.",
    "keywords": [
        "SEC filings", 
        "EDGAR", 
        "financial reports",
        "10-K",
        "proxies"
    ]
}
