 Unfortunately there is not enough context in the prompt to generate a detailed JSON object. The prompt references an "input" text, but does not include any sample text. Without sample text to analyze and extract information from, I do not have the necessary information to populate a JSON object with keys like id, authors, conference, etc. 

To generate a useful JSON response, the prompt would need to include the actual text that the JSON should be based on. For example:

"Generate a JSON object for the following research paper abstract: 'We analyzed the effects of climate change on crop yields over the past 50 years. The authors were Jane Smith, John Doe, and Bob Wilson from Major University.'"

With a text sample like that, I could then scan the content to identify authors, extract the year, generate a description, and so on. But without any text or content to work with, I unfortunately cannot create the requested JSON object. Please provide a text sample in the prompt and I would be happy to generate the JSON format based on analyzing that content.
