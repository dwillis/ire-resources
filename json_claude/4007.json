 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4007",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "How projects come up short",
  "description": "Tips for planning investigative stories, including common pitfalls and key questions to ask throughout the reporting process.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative reporting",
    "story planning",
    "reporting"
  ]
}
```

I left the authors array empty since no author names were provided. The conference, year, and affiliation are listed as "Not Listed" since those details were not included. The description summarizes the main points, and the keywords capture some of the key themes.
