 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "3101",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "George Papajohn",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Chicago Tribune"
    },
    {
      "name": "Sam Roe",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Chicago Tribune"
    },
    {
      "name": "Hagit Limor",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "WCPO-Cincinnati"
    },
    {
      "name": "Ellen Gabler",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2008",
  "title": "Using testing for stories",
  "description": "The text provides tips and examples for journalists on incorporating scientific testing into news stories and investigations.",
  "keywords": [
    "testing",
    "methodology",
    "investigations",
    "science",
    "journalism"
  ]
}
```

The key things I did:

- Set the id to 3101
- Extracted author names and affiliations where available
- Set conference to "IRE" based on the text
- Set year to 2008 based on the text 
- Created a 1-2 sentence summary for description
- Selected 5 relevant non-author keywords

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON!
