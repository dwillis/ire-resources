 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
  "id": "4554",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "ICI"
    },
    {
      "name": "Marina Walker Guevara",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "ICI"
    },
    {
      "name": "John Kelly",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "USA Today"
    },
    {
      "name": "Richard Pienciak",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "AP"
    },
    {
      "name": "Ellen Weiss",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Scripps"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "MANAGING THE MULTI-NEWSROOM PROJECT",
  "description": "Tips for managing a collaborative investigative journalism project across multiple newsrooms.",
  "keywords": [
    "collaboration", 
    "investigation",
    "project management"
  ]
}
```

The key things I did:

- Set id to 4554
- Extracted author names and affiliations when available
- Set conference to IRE based on it being mentioned 
- Did not have a clear year so set to Not Listed
- Used the all-caps title as the title
- Summarized the overall purpose in a couple sentences 
- Picked keywords based on main themes

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON!
