 Here is the JSON object created from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "5851",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null, 
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "\"Visualizing Your Investigation\"",
  "description": "Tips and techniques for visual storytelling and producing investigative stories for broadcast.",
  "keywords": [
    "visual",
    "storytelling",
    "investigative",
    "broadcast",
    "production"
  ]
}
```

I made the following decisions in constructing this JSON:

- No author name was listed, so I left name as null
- No email or affiliation was available, so I left those null
- There was no clear conference or year, so I put "Not Listed"
- The title was in quotes in the original text
- The description summarizes the main topic as tips for visual storytelling and production for investigations on broadcast
- The keywords try to capture the main topics covered without repeating conference or authors

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON!
