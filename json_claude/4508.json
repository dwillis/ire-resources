 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the text:

```json
{
  "id": "4508",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Intercept"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2015",
  "title": "Investigative Research Links",
  "description": "A guide with links and tips for investigative journalists to search public records, databases, watchlists and other online resources.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative research",
    "public records", 
    "databases",
    "tips"
  ]
}
```

I included The Intercept as the affiliation since Margot Williams is listed from The Intercept. The description is my attempt at a 1-2 sentence summary. The conference, year, and title values are taken directly from the text. The keywords are a selection of relevant terms excluding the conference and authors.
