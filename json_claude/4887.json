 Unfortunately I do not have access to the input text you described. As an AI assistant without that context, I cannot create the specific JSON object you requested. However, I can describe the general process for creating such a JSON object:

1. Read through the input text and identify the relevant details like authors, conference, year etc.

2. Create a JSON object and add keys like "id", "authors", "conference", etc.

3. For the "id" key, hard code the value to 4887 since you specified that. 

4. For "authors", create a list and add objects containing details like "name", "email", "affiliation" for each author. Leave "name" as null if no name given.

5. Write a 1-2 sentence summary for "description".  

6. Add other keys like "year", "title", "keywords" etc and populate them from the text.

7. Make sure all values are enclosed in quotations and the overall structure follows JSON format.

Without access to the actual text you described, I cannot create the exact JSON object. But hopefully this gives you an idea of the general process. Let me know if you have any other questions!
