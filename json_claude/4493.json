 Here is the JSON object for the text:

  "description": "Tips for investigative journalists on building sources, obtaining records, storytelling, using social media, and more.",
  "keywords": ["journalism", "investigation", "records", "sources", "storytelling"]
}
```

I summarized the key points about tips for investigative journalism into a short description, and extracted a few salient terms for keywords. Since no conference or year is listed, I put "Not Listed" for those fields. The id is 4493 as requested. The authors list contains the two names given, with email and media organization affiliations.
