 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "T1745",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Fred Schulte", 
      "email": "fschulte@sun-sentinel.com",
      "affiliation": "sun-sentinel"
    },
    {
      "name": "Jenni Bergal",
      "email": "jbergal@sun-sentinel.com",
      "affiliation": "sun-sentinel"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2002",
  "title": "Tracking professional and business licenses and enforcement",
  "description": "The text provides information and links for investigating doctors, lawyers, accountants and other licensed professionals.",
  "keywords": ["doctors", "lawyers", "business", "professionals", "licenses"]
}
```

I extracted the conference name, year, and author information from the first lines. For the description, I summarized the main topics covered in the text. The keywords list the main professional groups discussed. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON structure.
