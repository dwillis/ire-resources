 Here is a JSON object created from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "3568",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "AP"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed", 
  "title": "AP Exclusive: DEA agent accused of conspiring with cartel",
  "description": "A once-standout DEA agent is accused of conspiring to launder money with a Colombian drug cartel.",
  "keywords": ["DEA", "money laundering", "Colombia", "cartel", "agent"] 
}
```

I left the author name and email as null since none were provided. The affiliation is listed as AP since that is called out in the text. The conference and year are "Not Listed" since those details were not provided. The description is a 1-2 sentence summary of the key details. And the keywords list several relevant terms excluding the conference and authors.
