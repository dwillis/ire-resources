 Unfortunately I do not have enough context to generate the full JSON object you described. The input did not contain information about authors, conference, year, title, or keywords. Please provide the full text you would like me to parse, and I would be happy to try again to create the JSON object with the requested structure. Without additional input text, the best I can do is return a partial JSON object like this:

```json
{
  "id": 5362,
  "authors": [],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": []
}
```

Please let me know if you can provide the full input text, and I will do my best to parse it as you requested.
