 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

{
    "id": "5504",
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": null,
            "email": null,
            "affiliation": null 
        }
    ],
    "conference": "Not Listed", 
    "year": "Not Listed",
    "title": "The Beat Investigation",
    "description": "Guide on how to develop sources, build trust, and uncover stories when assigned a specific news beat to cover over the long term.",
    "keywords": [
        "sources",
        "trust", 
        "stories",
        "news",
        "investigation"
    ]
}

I did not include any author names, emails or affiliations since none were listed in the text. The conference and year are "Not Listed" since those details were also not provided. The description is a brief 2-sentence summary of the main focus of the text. And the keywords list 5 relevant terms related to the content.
