 Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```json
{
  "id": "4750",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "9NEWS / DENVER"
    },
    {
      "name": null, 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "KIPLINGER PROGRAM / OHIO STATE UNIV."
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "DIG DEEPER WITH SOCIAL MEDIA",
  "description": "The text suggests using specific social media accounts and tools to dig deeper into stories.",
  "keywords": ["social media", "tools", "accounts", "news", "reporting"]
}
```

I included the suggested social media accounts and tools as the affiliations for the authors, since no individual names were listed. The conference, year, and title were taken directly from the input text. The description summarizes the key idea in simple terms. And keywords list some topical terms related to the content.
