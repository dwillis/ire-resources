 Unfortunately I do not have enough context to extract all of the requested information from the text you provided. Here is what I can determine:

```json
{
  "id": "4172",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Center for Public Integrity" 
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "The Kingmakers: Tracking money and influence in politics Tipsheet by Michael Beckel, Center for Public Integrity",
  "description": "A tipsheet about tracking money and influence in politics.",
  "keywords": [
    "money", 
    "politics",
    "influence"
  ] 
}
```

The text does not clearly contain conference, year or author name information. I included the Center for Public Integrity as the affiliation since that is mentioned. The description is a short 1-2 sentence summary. And the keywords list contains a few relevant terms. Please provide more complete source text if you need additional fields populated.
