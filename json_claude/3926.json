 Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```json
{
  "id": "3926",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Corporate Whistleblowers",
  "description": "Whistleblower lawsuits are an important tool for the Department of Justice to fight fraud, having recovered $5 billion in 2012.",
  "keywords": [
    "Fraud",
    "Whistleblowers",
    "Lawsuits",
    "False Claims Act",
    "Lincoln Law"
  ]  
}
```

I left the author name, email, and affiliation null since no authors were listed. The conference and year are "Not Listed" since those details were not provided. The description is a 1-2 sentence summary of the key points. The keywords list contains relevant terms excluding the conference and authors.
