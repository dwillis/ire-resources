 Unfortunately I do not have the full text to extract detailed metadata from. Based on the information provided, here is a JSON object with placeholder values:

```json
{
  "id": "3723",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": []
}
```

I included the required keys and structure you specified, but without the full text I cannot populate the values with actual metadata. Please provide the full text and I would be happy to extract the details to populate this JSON object.
