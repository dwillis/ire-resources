 Here is the JSON object for the given text:

```json
{
  "id": "3931",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Julia Angwin", "email": null, "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Surveillance News Explained",
  "description": "Julia Angwin explains government surveillance programs revealed in 2013.",
  "keywords": ["surveillance", "NSA", "privacy"] 
}
```

I included Julia Angwin as the only listed author, left email and affiliation null since none are provided. The conference and year are "Not Listed" since no conference is mentioned. The description summarizes the main topic, and keywords list relevant terms related to the content.
