 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4161",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Hagit Limor",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "WXIX-TV"
    },
    {
      "name": "Phil Drechsler",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "KNBC"  
    },
    {
      "name": "Eric Flack",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "WAVE-TV"
    },
    {
      "name": "Steve Cyrkin",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "Tips and information for journalists to avoid being defrauded when reporting on the memorabilia industry.",
  "keywords": [
    "fraud",
    "memorabilia", 
    "autographs",
    "forgery",
    "reporting"
  ]
}
```

I included the key details from the text like the authors, a short description, relevant keywords, and left the conference, year, and title as "Not Listed" since those details were not clearly provided. The id is set to 4161 as requested. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON!
