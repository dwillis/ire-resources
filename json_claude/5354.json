 Here is the JSON object created from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "5354",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "El Comercio"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "El Comercio's interactive longforms",
  "description": "El Comercio publishes interactive longform stories.",
  "keywords": [
    "longform",
    "interactive",
    "stories",
    "publishes"
  ]
}
```

I included "El Comercio" as the affiliation since it was mentioned as a news organization. The conference, year, and authors name/email were not provided, so I listed those as "Not Listed" or null. The description is a short 1 sentence summary, and keywords are relevant terms from the content excluding the conference and authors.
