 Here is the JSON object created from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "3889",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Wall Street Journal"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Business Investigations",
  "description": "An overview of tools and techniques for investigating businesses, with a focus on mining data from SEC filings.",
  "keywords": [
    "SEC", 
    "filings",
    "investigations",
    "businesses",
    "data"
  ]
}
```

I parsed the text to identify the author's affiliation with the Wall Street Journal, and summarized the main topic as an investigation of businesses using SEC data. The conference was not explicitly listed, but based on context clues I assumed it was NICAR. The year was not provided. The keywords cover some of the main concepts discussed without duplicating the conference name or author affiliation.
