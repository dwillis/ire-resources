 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "3804",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "WisconsinWatch.org"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Tracking your impact", 
  "description": "A journalist discusses methods for tracking the reach and influence of news stories.",
  "keywords": [
    "tracking",
    "impact", 
    "news stories",
    "reach",
    "influence"
  ]
}
```

I included WisconsinWatch.org as the affiliation since it was mentioned in the text. The description summarizes the main topic. And I chose 5 relevant keywords to characterize the content.
