 Based on the instructions, here is a JSON object I created from the input:

{
    "id": "4654_4",
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": null, 
            "email": null,
            "affiliation": "The Associated Press"
        }
    ],
    "conference": "NICAR",
    "year": "Not Listed",
    "title": "Journalists mine Pesky public records with help of friendly civic hackers",
    "description": "Journalists team up with civic hackers to get access to public records and data.",
    "keywords": [
        "public records",
        "data",
        "journalists", 
        "civic hackers",
        "partnerships"
    ]
}

I included The Associated Press as the affiliation since that was the only organization mentioned. The description is a 1-2 sentence summary of the main point. The conference field is NICAR since that term was used. The year is unspecified so I put "Not Listed". And the keywords are relevant terms related to the content but excluding the conference name and author information.
