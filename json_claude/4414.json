 Here is the JSON object created from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": 4414,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Roy Wenzl is data editor at The Wichita Eagle in Kansas"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",  
  "title": "How we used Python notebooks at The Wichita Eagle",
  "description": "Roy Wenzl describes how The Wichita Eagle used Python notebooks for a news reporting project.",
  "keywords": [
    "python",
    "notebooks",
    "data",
    "reporting",
    "news"
  ]
}
```

I set the conference to "NICAR" since the text mentions using Python notebooks for a news reporting project. The year was not clearly listed, so I set it to "Not Listed". The description summarizes the key points from the text. The keywords list relevant terms related to the content. Let me know if you need me to modify anything!
