 Here is the JSON object created from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5989",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "John Hillkirk", "email": null, "affiliation": "KHN"},
    {"name": "Kathleen McGrory", "email": null, "affiliation": "Tampa Bay Times"}, 
    {"name": "Liz Lucas", "email": null, "affiliation": "KHN"},
    {"name": "Shefali Luthra", "email": null, "affiliation": "The 19th*"}
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2020",
  "title": "How To Be A Better Health Care Watchdog",
  "description": "Tips and resources for investigating health care systems and data.",
  "keywords": ["health care", "data", "investigating", "resources", "tips"]  
}
```

I summarized the text into a short description, used "IRE" as the conference since it is mentioned, used 2020 as the year since that seems to be indicated, and listed 5 relevant keywords. The id is 5989 and the authors are parsed from the bylines with affiliations if available.
