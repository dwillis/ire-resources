 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5610_presentation2",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "The Washington Post"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "Text provides personality profiles and strategies for building relationships with different types of news sources.",
  "keywords": [
    "news sources", 
    "reporter strategies",
    "building relationships",
    "source personalities"
  ]
}
```

I left the author name and email as null since none were provided. I used "The Washington Post" as the affiliation since that was the only organization mentioned. The conference, year, and title were left as "Not Listed" since those details were not provided. The description summarizes the main purpose of the text, and the keywords list some of the main topics covered without repeating the conference or authors.
