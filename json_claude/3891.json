 Unfortunately there is no input text provided to create the requested JSON object from. Since no text is given, I will create an example JSON object with dummy data:

```json
{
  "id": "3891",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null, 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "This is a dummy description since no input text was provided.",
  "keywords": [
    "dummy",
    "data", 
    "example",
    "json",
    "object"
  ]
}
```

I included null values for name, email, and affiliation since no author information was provided. The conference, year, and title are set to "Not Listed" since that information was also not provided. The description is a dummy 1-2 sentence summary, and keywords are dummy terms I created.

Please provide an input text for me to parse if you would like an actual JSON object created from textual data. I'd be happy to create the object from a provided sample text.
