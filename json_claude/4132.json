 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

{
  "id": "4132",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "National Institute on Money in State Politics"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Campaign Finance: News Tips",
  "description": "The text provides campaign finance news tips and story ideas for reporters.",
  "keywords": [
    "campaign finance",
    "fundraising",
    "disclosure",
    "contributions",
    "state politics"
  ]
}

I left the author name, email, and affiliation blank since no author was listed, and put "Not Listed" for conference and year since those details were not provided. The description is a short 1-2 sentence summary, and I listed 5 relevant keywords from the content. Please let me know if you would like me to modify anything!
