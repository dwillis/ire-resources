 Unfortunately I do not have access to the full text that was provided as input. Based on the instructions, here is an example JSON object with made up data that matches the requested structure:

```json
{
  "id": "5584",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Jane Doe",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Daily News"
    },
    {
      "name": null, 
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2022",
  "title": "Examining Open Data Policies",
  "description": "This research examines open data policies and their impact.",
  "keywords": [
    "open data",
    "policies",
    "impacts",
    "government",
    "transparency"
  ]
}
```

I included fictional data to demonstrate the expected structure with example values. Without any input text I cannot extract actual values to populate the JSON. Please provide the full text you would like analyzed so I can process it and identify the appropriate JSON data based on your instructions.
