 Here is the JSON object for the text:

```json
{
  "id": "4967",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Reveal"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "\"Beyond bias\" training aims to reduce racial disparities in new App",
  "description": "An article describing a new app called justU that aims to reduce racial disparities in policing through implicit bias training for officers.",
  "keywords": [
    "policing",
    "bias",
    "training",
    "app",
    "racial disparities"
  ]
}
```

I left the author name and email null since none was listed. I used "Reveal" as the affiliation since that seems to be the news organization that published the article. The conference and year are "Not Listed" since they were not clearly identified. The description is a 1-2 sentence summary, and the keywords list 5 relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. Let me know if you need any changes!
