 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json

    },

  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",

  "description": "Tipsheet with ideas for investigating issues in youth sports, high school sports, college sports and professional sports.",
  "keywords": [
    "youth sports",
    "high school", 
    "college",
    "NCAA",
    "investigation"
  ]
}
```

I've included the first 5 affiliations as the authors, used the title provided, summarized the content in the description, listed "Not Listed" for the conference and year since those details were not provided, and included 5 relevant keywords. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON!
