 Here is the JSON object generated from the input text:

```json

      "name": "Ana Ley",
      "email": "ley.anag@gmail.com",

    },
    {
      "name": "Rebecca Tan",
      "email": "rebecca.tan@washpost.com",

    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Local government accountability",
  "description": "Story ideas and tips for investigating and reporting on local government accountability issues.",
  "keywords": [
    "government",
    "accountability",
    "investigations",
    "reporting"
  ]
}
```

I made assumptions where details were missing, like leaving out a year and conference since those were not clearly stated. The description summarizes the main topic. The keywords capture some of the main themes. Let me know if you would like me to modify anything!
