 Unfortunately I do not have the full text to analyze and create the requested JSON object. From the information provided, I can create a partial JSON object as follows:

```json
{
  "id": "5842",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null 
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": []
}
```

If you could provide the full text, I would be happy to analyze it and populate the JSON with the requested details. Please let me know if you have any other questions!
