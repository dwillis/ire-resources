 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

```json
{
    "id": "T2626",
    "authors": [
        {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": "The Charlotte Observer"},
        {"name": "Lisa Hammersly Munn", "email": null, "affiliation": "The Charlotte Observer"},
        {"name": "Binyamin Appelbaum", "email": null, "affiliation": "The Charlotte Observer"},
        {"name": "Ted Mellnik", "email": null, "affiliation": "The Charlotte Observer"}
    ],
    "conference": "NICAR", 
    "year": "Not Listed",
    "title": "Foreclosing on the American Dream",
    "description": "The story examines factors driving home foreclosures and provides reporting techniques and data sources journalists can use to cover the issue.",
    "keywords": ["foreclosure", "home loans", "lenders", "property records"]
}
```

I set the conference to NICAR since this appears to be material prepared for an IRE conference session. The year is unspecified. The description summarizes the main points. The keywords capture some of the main topics covered without repeating the conference name or author affiliations.
