 Here is the JSON object for the text:

```json
{
   "id":3048,
   "authors":[
      {
         "name":"Bill Allison",
         "email":"ballison@sunlightfoundation.com",
         "affiliation":"Sunlight Foundation"
      },
      {
         "name":"David Heath",
         "email":null,
         "affiliation":"The Seattle Times"
      },
      {
         "name":"James V. Grimaldi",
         "email":"grimaldij@washpost.com",
         "affiliation":"The Washington Post"
      }
   ],
   "conference":"NICAR",
   "year":"Not Listed",
   "title":"CAR for money and politics",
   "description":"The text provides tips and resources for investigating money in politics.",
   "keywords":[
      "lobbying",
      "campaign finance",
      "non-profits",
      "lawsuits",
      "government documents"
   ]
}
```

I set the id to 3048, created an authors array with name, email and affiliation for each listed author, used "NICAR" for the conference since that acronym appears in the text, set year to "Not Listed" since no year is given, created a short description summarizing the content, and listed 5 relevant keywords excluding the conference and authors.
