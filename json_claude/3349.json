 Here is my attempt at creating the JSON object from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "3349",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Alex Richards", "email": null, "affiliation": "Las Vegas Sun"}, 
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "2010",
  "title": "Human: Resources for health topics",
  "description": "Overview of data sources for researching health and healthcare issues such as mortality data from the CDC and hospital quality data.",
  "keywords": ["health", "data", "CDC", "mortality", "hospitals"] 
}
```

I set the id to 3349, added the one listed author name and affiliation, and set the conference to NICAR since that acronym is referenced. 2010 seems to be clearly identified as the year. For the description, I summarized the main focus on health data sources. And for keywords I pulled out some topical terms related to the content. Let me know if you would like me to modify or improve the JSON object in any way!
