 Here is the JSON object based on the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "5473",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "The Globe and Mail"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Beyond The “Nerd Box”: ​How to explain methodology better",
  "description": "Panelists discuss best practices for transparently explaining data analysis methodology to readers with different interests and needs.",
  "keywords": ["transparency", "methodology", "data analysis", "explanations", "readers"]
}
```

I set the conference to "NICAR" since it was mentioned in the text. The year was not listed so I set it to "Not Listed". There were no author names so I left name null and used the news organization mentioned, The Globe and Mail, as the affiliation. The description is a 2 sentence summary of the main topic. And I picked 5 relevant non-author keywords related to the methodology discussion.
