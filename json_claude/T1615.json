 Here is the JSON object for the input text:

  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Tips for Navigating Legal Landscape for Investigative Reporting After September 11",
  "description": "Panel provides recommendations for investigative journalists to anticipate and address legal issues when reporting stories related to national security.",
  "keywords": ["legal", "national security", "investigative reporting", "tips", "guidelines"]
}
```

I identified the conference as IRE based on the panel members listed. Since a specific year is not provided, I put "Not Listed" for year. The description summarizes the key focus of the tips, and the keywords highlight important themes covered without duplicating conference name or author names.
