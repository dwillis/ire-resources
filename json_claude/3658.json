 Here is the JSON object I created from the input:

{
    "id": "3658",
    "authors": [
        {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": null},
        {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": null},
        {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": null}
    ],
    "conference": "Not Listed", 
    "year": "Not Listed",
    "title": "",
    "description": "The text does not contain enough information to generate a 1-2 sentence summary.",
    "keywords": []
}

I left most values as null or empty since there was no input text provided to extract information from. The conference and year are set to "Not Listed" since those details were not given. The description states that there is not enough information to create a summary, and the keywords list is empty. Please let me know if you would like me to attempt creating the JSON object from any actual input text you provide.
