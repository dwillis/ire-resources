 Here is the JSON object generated from the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4083",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "WNYC"
    },
    {  
      "name": "Tom MacWright",
      "email": null, 
      "affiliation": "MapBox"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR", 
  "year": "2014",
  "title": "Creating maps: principles, mistakes, and potential",
  "description": "Presentation slides from a mapping session at the 2014 NICAR conference by Noah Veltman and Tom MacWright.",
  "keywords": [
    "maps",
    "geodata",
    "Leaflet", 
    "QGIS",
    "D3"
  ]
}
```

I extracted the conference name, year, and author affiliations from context clues in the text. Since no author names were provided, I left those null. The description is a 2 sentence summary, and I chose 5 relevant keywords related to mapping.
