 Here is the JSON object based on the input text:

```json
{
  "id": "4123",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Jaimi Dowdell", "email": null, "affiliation": "IRE"},
    {"name": "Megan Luther", "email": null, "affiliation": "IRE/NICAR"}
  ],
  "conference": "IRE/NICAR", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Breaking news hands-on",
  "description": "An exercise to practice investigating breaking news by imagining an explosion at a petroleum plant in Louisiana.",
  "keywords": ["investigation", "breaking news", "deadline", "explosion", "plant"]
}
```

I extracted the author names, conference name, and created a short description and list of keywords based on the content. Since a specific year was not provided, I put "Not Listed" for the year key. The authors do not have email addresses or complete affiliation information listed, so those values are null where missing.
