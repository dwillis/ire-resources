 Here is the JSON object generated from the input:

```json
{
  "id": "3549",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Kimberly Miller", "email": null, "affiliation": "Palm Beach Post"},
    {"name": "Mary Shanklin", "email": null, "affiliation": "Orlando Sentinel"},
    {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": null}
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed", 
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text provides examples of stories related to the mortgage crisis, including targeting of Hispanic borrowers, inflated appraisals, and differences in how banks handle distressed properties in wealthy versus poor areas.",
  "keywords": ["mortgage", "foreclosure", "housing", "Hispanic", "appraisal"]
}
```

I made assumptions to fill in some missing information like the conference name and year. The title was not provided so I left it null. Let me know if you need any changes to this JSON structure.
