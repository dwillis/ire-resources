 Here is the JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "5413",
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Teri Sforza", "email": null, "affiliation": "Orange County Register/Southern California News Group"}
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2018",
  "title": "Probing addiction treatment during an opioid epidemic",
  "description": "The text provides suggestions for investigating the opioid crisis and addiction treatment in local communities, including data sources and potential stories.",
  "keywords": ["opioids", "addiction", "treatment", "data"]
}
```

I set the conference to "NICAR" since that acronym is mentioned, and the year to 2018 since that is given in the conference location. The description summarizes the main focus of the text, and the keywords list some of the main topics covered without repeating information already captured. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the JSON structure!
