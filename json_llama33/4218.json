Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "4218",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "This text appears to be a list of resources and organizations related to journalism, immigration, and human rights. It includes links to various websites, think tanks, and advocacy groups.",
  "keywords": [
    "journalism",
    "immigration",
    "human rights",
    "resources",
    "organizations"
  ]
}
```

Note that I had to make some assumptions since the input text did not provide explicit information for some of the fields. I left the `name` field as `null` since no author was listed, and I used a generic description to summarize the content of the text. I also chose "Not Listed" for the `conference` and `year` fields since this information was not provided. Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help with!
