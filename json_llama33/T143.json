Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "T143",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Journalism in Global",
  "description": "The text discusses the importance of access to information and the role of journalism in the global community. It highlights the need for laws to protect journalists and ensure their ability to report on events of public interest.",
  "keywords": [
    "journalism",
    "global community",
    "access to information",
    "media freedom"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there is no specific author mentioned in the text, I left the `name` attribute as `null`. Also, since there is no clear indication of the conference or year, I listed them as "Not Listed". The description is a brief summary of the text in simple language. Let me know if you'd like me to make any changes!
