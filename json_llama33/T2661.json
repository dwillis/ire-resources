Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "T2661",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text discusses various topics related to computer-assisted reporting, including web scraping, regular expressions, and programming languages such as Perl and PHP. It also touches on the differences between open-source and proprietary software.",
  "keywords": [
    "web scraping",
    "regular expressions",
    "programming languages",
    "open-source software",
    "computer-assisted reporting"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there is no specific title or author mentioned in the text, I have left those fields as null. The conference is listed as NICAR, but it's not explicitly stated in the text, so this might be incorrect. The year is also not clearly identified, so I have listed it as "Not Listed". The description and keywords are based on my understanding of the text. Let me know if you need any further changes!
