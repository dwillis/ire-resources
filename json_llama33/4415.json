Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "4415",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "NBC Bay Area"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Real Time Exercise",
  "description": "This is a real-time exercise by Stephen Stock, a senior investigative reporter at NBC Bay Area. The text appears to be a list of useful websites for investigative reporting.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative reporting",
    "useful websites",
    "research tools"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since the name is not explicitly mentioned, I left it as `null`. Also, I used "NICAR" as the conference since Stephen Stock is a speaker at NICAR. If this is incorrect, please let me know and I'll change it to "Not Listed". Additionally, I limited the keywords to three terms, but if you'd like me to add more, please let me know!
