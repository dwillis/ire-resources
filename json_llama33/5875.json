Here is the JSON object based on the input:

      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press",
  "description": "The text appears to be a collection of resources and guides for journalists, including information on recording police, bodycam footage, and libel basics. It also includes a map of state legislation and police department policies regarding public access to police bodycams.",
  "keywords": [
    "journalism",
    "police",
    "bodycam",
    "libel",
    "freedom of the press"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there are no specific authors mentioned in the text, I have left the `name` attribute as `null`. Similarly, since there is no clear indication of the conference or year, I have listed them as "Not Listed". The description is a brief summary of the content in simple language. The keywords are a selection of relevant terms that are not too specific or too general. Let me know if you'd like me to make any changes!
