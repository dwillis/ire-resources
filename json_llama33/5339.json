}
```

Note: Since there are no specific authors mentioned in the text, I left the `name` attribute as `null`. If you'd like to include a generic term like "NICAR" or "Unknown" instead, please let me know. Also, I've kept the `affiliation` and `email` attributes as `null` since there's no relevant information in the text.
