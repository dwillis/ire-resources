Here is the JSON object:

```
{
  "id": "T2367",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "This text appears to be a tutorial or guide for using Excel, covering various topics such as data entry, formatting, and troubleshooting. It also mentions downloading data from the web and converting PDF files to text.",
  "keywords": [
    "Excel",
    "data entry",
    "formatting",
    "troubleshooting"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there is no clear information about the authors, conference, year, or title, I have left those fields as null or "Not Listed". The description is a brief summary of the text in simple language. The keywords are a list of relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. Let me know if you'd like me to revise anything!
