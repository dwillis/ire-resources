Here is the JSON object:

```
{
  "id": "4853_1",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "This text describes how to split apart city and state when it's not delimited, and how to use the LEN function in Excel. It also discusses how to parse data and create a JSON object.",
  "keywords": [
    "data parsing",
    "Excel",
    "LEN function"
  ]
}
```

Please note that I've left some fields as `null` since there was no information provided in the text. If you'd like me to fill in any of these fields, please let me know! 

Also, I want to point out that the original prompt seems to be a mix of two different tasks: one related to Excel and data parsing, and another related to creating a JSON object from a given text. If you could provide more context or clarify which task you'd like me to focus on, I'd be happy to help!
