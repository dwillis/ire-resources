Here is the JSON object based on the provided text:

```
{
  "id": "2918",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2007",
  "title": "Researching Experts",
  "description": "This text provides a guide on how to research experts, including searching court records and online databases. It offers tips and resources for investigating expert testimony.",
  "keywords": [
    "expert testimony",
    "court records",
    "research guide"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there is no author mentioned in the text, I left the `name` field as `null`. Also, I chose `IRE` as the conference since it is mentioned in the text as a relevant event. The year `2007` is extracted from the text as the revision date of the research guide. Let me know if you need any further modifications!
