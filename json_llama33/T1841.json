Note: Since there is no clear author name mentioned in the text, I have left the `name` attribute as `null`. Also, since the year of the event is not clearly identified, I have listed it as "Not Listed". The conference has been assumed to be NICAR based on the context, but if this is incorrect, please let me know.
