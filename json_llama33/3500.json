Note: Since there are no specific author names mentioned in the text, I left the `name` field as `null`. The affiliation for one of the authors is listed as "Los Angeles Times" because it is mentioned in the text as the organization that Rick Meyer is from. The other author's affiliation is not specified, so it is listed as "Not Listed".
