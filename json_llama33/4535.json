Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "4535",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Human Rights Storytelling",
  "description": "The text provides guidelines and tips for telling human rights stories, including techniques for narrative storytelling and informed consent. It also includes links to useful resources, such as the National Human Rights Commission of India.",
  "keywords": [
    "human rights",
    "storytelling",
    "narrative techniques",
    "informed consent"
  ]
}
```

Note that I've left the author information blank since there is no mention of a specific author in the input text. I've also listed the conference as "Not Listed" since it's not clear which conference this text is associated with. Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help with!
