Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "4718",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "This text is a tutorial on using QGIS for mapping and data analysis. It covers topics such as projecting, styling, and selecting by location.",
  "keywords": [
    "QGIS",
    "mapping",
    "data analysis",
    "geographic information systems"
  ]
}
```

Note that since there was no specific author mentioned in the text, I left the `name` field as `null`. Similarly, since there was no conference or year mentioned, I used the default values of `"Not Listed"`. The `description` is a brief summary of the text, and the `keywords` are a list of relevant terms. Let me know if you have any further requests!
