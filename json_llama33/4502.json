Note: Since there is no author mentioned in the text, I left the name as null. Also, the conference is assumed to be NICAR (National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting) based on the content of the text, but it's not explicitly stated. If you have more information about the context, please let me know and I'll be happy to update the JSON object accordingly.
