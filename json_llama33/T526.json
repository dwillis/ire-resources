Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "T526",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "This text appears to be a guide for investigating companies and individuals, providing tips on where to find information and how to use public records. It includes lists of agencies, filings, and sources that may be useful for investigative research.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative research",
    "public records",
    "company investigation",
    "financial research",
    "journalism"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there is no clear author, title, or conference/year listed in the input text, I have left those fields as null or "Not Listed" accordingly. The description is a brief summary of the content, and the keywords are a selection of relevant terms that exclude the conference and authors.
