Here is the JSON object with the requested information:

```
{
  "id": "3649",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2012",
  "title": "Web Scraping Tools and Techniques",
  "description": "The text discusses various web scraping tools and techniques, including tips for responsible scraping and resources for learning more. It highlights the importance of understanding data structures and patterns to effectively scrape data.",
  "keywords": [
    "web scraping",
    "data extraction",
    "tools",
    "techniques",
    "responsible scraping"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there are no specific authors mentioned in the text, I left the `name` attribute as `null`. The `affiliation` is also `null` since there is no clear affiliation mentioned. If a news organization was mentioned, it could be used as the affiliation, but that is not the case here. Let me know if you have any further requests!
