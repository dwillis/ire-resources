  "keywords": [
    "investigative reporting",
    "legal research",

  ]
}
```

Note: Since there are no specific authors mentioned in the text, I left the author's name as null. Also, since the conference and year are not clearly identified, I listed them as "Not Listed". The title is also not specified, so it is listed as null. The description provides a brief summary of the text, and the keywords are a list of relevant terms excluding the conference and authors.
