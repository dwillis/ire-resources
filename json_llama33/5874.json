Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "5874",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "This text appears to be a collection of resources and links related to investigative journalism, including databases, tools, and websites. It does not seem to have a specific topic or theme.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative journalism",
    "resources",
    "databases",
    "tools"
  ]
}
```

Note that I've left the `name` field in the `authors` list as `null`, since there are no author names mentioned in the text. Similarly, I've left the `title` field as `null`, since there is no clear title or heading in the text. The `conference` and `year` fields are also set to "Not Listed", since this information is not present in the text.
