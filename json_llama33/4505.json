  "description": "This text provides tips and guidelines for investigating prisons, including what records to request and how to navigate the process. It also highlights the importance of following the money trail and looking at prison contracts.",
  "keywords": [
    "prison investigation",
    "FOIA requests",
    "prison contracts",
    "private prisons",
    "investigative journalism"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there is no specific author mentioned in the text, I have left the `name` field as `null`. Also, since the year of the event is not clearly identified, I have used `"Not Listed"` for the `year` field. The conference is assumed to be `"IRE"` based on the style and content of the text, but this could be changed to `"NICAR"` or `"Not Listed"` if more context were provided.
