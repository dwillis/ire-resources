Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "3012",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Border Coverage",
  "description": "The text discusses the challenges of covering border-related stories and the importance of accurate reporting. It highlights the need for journalists to penetrate the silence surrounding government agencies and to provide a balanced view of the issues.",
  "keywords": [
    "border coverage",
    "immigration",
    "journalism",
    "investigative reporting",
    "government transparency"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there are no specific authors mentioned in the text, I left the `name` attribute as `null`. Also, since the conference and year are not clearly identified, I used "Not Listed" for those attributes. The description is a brief summary of the text in simple language, and the keywords are a list of relevant terms excluding the conference and authors.
