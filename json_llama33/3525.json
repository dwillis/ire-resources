Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "3525",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "ProPublica"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigating State Nursing Boards",
  "description": "This article provides tips and resources for investigating state nursing boards, including how to obtain disciplinary records and analyze data. It also highlights the importance of transparency in healthcare regulation.",
  "keywords": [
    "nursing boards",
    "investigative reporting",
    "healthcare regulation",
    "data analysis"
  ]
}
```

Note that I've made some assumptions about the input, as there were no explicit author names or email addresses mentioned. I've also limited the keywords to four terms, excluding the conference and authors. Let me know if you'd like me to revise anything!
