Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "3497",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "IRE"
    },
    {
      "name": "Michael Berens",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Seattle Times"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2011",
  "title": "Investigative Reporting Tips and Resources",
  "description": "This text provides tips and resources for investigative reporters, including how to find stories and documents. It also lists some useful websites for research.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative reporting",
    "research",
    "story ideas",
    "documents"
  ]
}
```

However I noticed that the original prompt does not include an author named Michael Berens or The Seattle Times, so here is a corrected JSON object:

```
{
  "id": "3497",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "IRE"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2011",
  "title": "Investigative Reporting Tips and Resources",
  "description": "This text provides tips and resources for investigative reporters, including how to find stories and documents. It also lists some useful websites for research.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative reporting",
    "research",
    "story ideas",
    "documents"
  ]
}
```
