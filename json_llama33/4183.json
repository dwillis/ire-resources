Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "4183",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2014",
  "title": "Geocoding Tips and Tricks",
  "description": "This text provides tips and best practices for geocoding, including how to prepare data and assess the accuracy of results. It also discusses common pitfalls and limitations of geocoding.",
  "keywords": [
    "geocoding",
    "mapping",
    "data analysis",
    "accuracy",
    "projections"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there are no authors mentioned in the text, I left the `name` field as `null`. Also, since the year of the event is not clearly identified, but a specific year (2014) is mentioned in the context of an example, I used that year. If you want to use "Not Listed" instead, please let me know.
