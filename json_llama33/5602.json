Here is the JSON object:

```
{
  "id": "5602",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigative Reporting Examples",
  "description": "The text provides a list of examples of investigative reporting, including stories about government corruption, public safety, and consumer protection. The examples include reports from various news organizations and highlight the use of data and documents in investigative journalism.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative reporting",
    "journalism",
    "data journalism"
  ]
}
```

However, upon reviewing the text again, I noticed that there are several authors mentioned, including BLORIOSO, CHENG, GELLER, LEE, etc. If you would like to include these authors in the JSON object, here is an updated version:

```
{
  "id": "5602",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "GLORIOSO",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "WNBC"
    },
    {
      "name": "CHENG",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "WNBC"
    },
    {
      "name": "GELLER",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "ABC13"
    },
    {
      "name": "LEE",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "ABC13"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigative Reporting Examples",
  "description": "The text provides a list of examples of investigative reporting, including stories about government corruption, public safety, and consumer protection.

}
```
