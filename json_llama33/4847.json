Note: The year was not explicitly mentioned in the text, but based on the context and the format of the slides (e.g., "16-06-11"), it appears to be from 2011. If you'd like to change it to "Not Listed", I can do so.

Also, since there is only one author's email mentioned, I've only included that one in the authors list. If you'd like to add more authors or modify the existing one, please let me know!
