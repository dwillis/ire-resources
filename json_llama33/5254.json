  "description": "The text provides tips and techniques for using Federal Election Commission (FEC) data to connect people and businesses, and to investigate campaign finance. It explains how to search for contributors by employer, occupation, and location.",
  "keywords": [
    "FEC data",
    "investigative reporting",
    "campaign finance"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there is no author name mentioned in the text, I have left the `name` field as `null`. Also, since the year of the event is not clearly identified, I have set the `year` field to `"Not Listed"`. The conference is assumed to be `"IRE"` based on the context. Let me know if you need any further changes!
