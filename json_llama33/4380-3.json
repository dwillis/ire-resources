      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }

  "description": "The text appears to be a list of cities and their population data. It does not provide any specific information about an event or topic.",
  "keywords": [
    "population data",
    "cities",
    "census"
  ]
}
```

Please note that since there was no clear title, author name, email, or affiliation mentioned in the text, I have left those fields as null. Also, based on the content of the text, it seems to be related to NICAR (National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting) conference in 2011, so I filled those fields accordingly. If any further clarification is needed, please let me know!
