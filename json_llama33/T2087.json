Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "T2087",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Dayton church"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text provides tips and guidelines for writing long-form stories, including how to craft a compelling lead, use subheads, and create engaging narratives. It also discusses the importance of using the web to enhance storytelling.",
  "keywords": [
    "storytelling",
    "narrative",
    "journalism",
    "writing"
  ]
}
```

However, upon closer inspection, I realize that I made an incorrect assumption about the affiliation. The text does mention several authors, including Russell Carollo and Mike Wagner, who appear to be affiliated with a news organization (likely the Dayton Daily News or a similar entity). Here is a revised version of the JSON object:

```
{
  "id": "T2087",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Russell Carollo",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Dayton news organization"
    },
    {
      "name": "Mike Wagner",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Dayton news organization"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text provides tips and guidelines for writing long-form stories, including how to craft a compelling lead, use subheads, and create engaging narratives. It also discusses the importance of using the web to enhance storytelling.",
  "keywords": [
    "storytelling",
    "narrative",
    "journalism",
    "writing"
  ]
}
```
