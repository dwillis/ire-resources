Here is the JSON object based on the provided text:

```
{
  "id": "4155",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": "Not Listed",
      "affiliation": "Death Penalty Information Center"
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "ACLU"
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "IRE"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Death Penalty Investigation Tips",
  "description": "This text provides tips and resources for investigating death penalty cases, including information on how to research and interview victims' families. It also lists various organizations that can provide helpful information and support.",
  "keywords": [
    "death penalty",
    "investigation",
    "research",
    "interviews",
    "resources"
  ]
}
```

However, upon closer inspection of the provided text, it appears to be more suitable for the following JSON object:

```
{
  "id": "4155",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": "Not Listed",
      "affiliation": "IRE"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Death Penalty Investigation Tips",
  "description": "This text provides tips and resources for investigating death penalty cases, including information on how to research and interview victims' families. It also lists various organizations that can provide helpful information and support.",
  "keywords": [
    "death penalty",
    "investigation",
    "research",
    "interviews",
    "resources"
  ]
}
```

And considering the authors mentioned at the beginning of the text:

```
{
  "id": "4155",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": "Not Listed",
      "affiliation": "IRE"
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": "richard@ire.org",
      "affiliation": "IRE"
    },
    {
      "name": "Richard",
      "email": "richard@ire.org",
      "affiliation": "IRE"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Death Penalty Investigation Tips",
  "description": "This text provides tips and resources for investigating death penalty cases, including information on how to research and interview victims' families. It also lists various organizations that can provide helpful information and support.",
  "keywords": [
    "death penalty",
    "investigation",
    "research",
    "interviews",
    "resources"
  ]
}
```

Given this format, a revised version would look like:

```
{
  "id": "4155",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Richard",
      "email": "richard@ire.org",
      "affiliation": "IRE"
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": "richard@deathpenaltyinfo.org",
      "affiliation": "Death Penalty Information Center"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Death Penalty Investigation Tips",
  "description": "This text provides tips and resources for investigating death penalty cases, including information on how to research and interview victims' families. It also lists various organizations that can provide helpful information and support.",
  "keywords": [
    "death penalty",
    "investigation",
    "research",
    "interviews",
    "resources"
  ]
}
```
