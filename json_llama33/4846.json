Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "4846",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "News organization (not specified)"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Storytelling process for investigative journalists",
  "description": "The author shares their step-by-step process for telling powerful and well-sourced stories, including organizing notes, finding characters, and structuring the narrative. The goal is to create engaging and easy-to-follow stories for readers.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative journalism",
    "storytelling",
    "narrative structure",
    "reporting process",
    "journalism techniques"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there is no specific author mentioned in the text, I left the `name` attribute as `null`. The `affiliation` attribute mentions a news organization, but since it's not specified which one, I used a generic phrase. Also, the year of the event is not clearly identified, so I set the `year` attribute to "Not Listed".
