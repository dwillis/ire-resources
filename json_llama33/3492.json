Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "3492",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Investigative Reporters and Editors"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2011",
  "title": "Jigsaw: A Tool for Investigative Journalists",
  "description": "Jigsaw is a tool designed to help investigative journalists analyze and visualize large amounts of data. It provides multiple visualizations and interactive views to help users identify connections and patterns in the data.",
  "keywords": [
    "data analysis",
    "investigative journalism",
    "visualization"
  ]
}
```

Note that I've made some assumptions about the title, as it wasn't explicitly stated in the input. Also, since there were no specific authors mentioned, I've left the name null and used the affiliation as "Investigative Reporters and Editors" based on the text. Let me know if this meets your requirements or if you need further modifications!
