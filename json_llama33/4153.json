Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "4153",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "This tutorial provides an introduction to SQL and SQLite, covering various topics such as querying data, joining tables, and working with dates. It aims to get users started with using SQL and SQLite for investigative reporting.",
  "keywords": [
    "SQL",
    "SQLite",
    "investigative reporting",
    "data analysis"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there is no specific information about the authors, title, or year in the input text, I have left those fields as null or "Not Listed" accordingly. The description is a brief summary of the text in simple language, and the keywords are a list of relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. Let me know if you'd like me to revise anything!
