Based on the input you provided (which seems to be missing), I'll create a sample JSON object with the required keys:

```json
{
  "id": "4680",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "New York Times"
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2020",
  "title": "Investigative Journalism Conference",
  "description": "This conference focuses on investigative journalism techniques and tools. It brings together journalists and experts to share knowledge and experiences.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative journalism",
    "data analysis",
    "reporting"
  ]
}
```

Please note that I've made some assumptions about the input, as it was not provided. You should replace the values with the actual information from your text.

Also, keep in mind that:

* The `name` attribute is set to `null` if no name is listed.
* The `affiliation` attribute uses the news organization's name if none appears next to the author name.
* The `description` is a brief summary of the text in simple language.
* The `conference` value is one of "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed".
* The `year` value is "Not Listed" if the year of the event is not clearly identified.
* The `keywords` list excludes the conference and authors, and has no more than five terms.
