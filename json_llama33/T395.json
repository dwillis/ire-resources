Here is the JSON object based on the provided input:

```
{
  "id": "T395",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text appears to be a collection of receipts and invoices from various companies, including AT&T and Western Union. It does not contain any meaningful information or summary.",
  "keywords": [
    "receipts",
    "invoices",
    "AT&T",
    "Western Union"
  ]
}
```

Note that I had to make some assumptions since the input text is mostly a jumbled collection of words and phrases, and it doesn't contain any clear information about authors, title, or conference. If you have any further clarification or details, I can try to improve the JSON object.
