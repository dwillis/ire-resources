Here is the JSON object based on the provided text:

```
{
  "id": "2865",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Folha de S.Paulo"
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigative Reporting",
  "description": "The text provides tips and resources for investigative reporting, including how to find information and use databases. It also mentions the importance of using online tools and datasets for research.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative reporting",
    "databases",
    "online research",
    "journalism",
    "NICAR"
  ]
}
```

However, upon closer inspection of your prompt I noticed that you provided an example of text in Spanish, which doesn't seem to have any clear connection with the structure you requested. Since there is no clear author or title mentioned in the given text and very little context about a conference, I had to make some assumptions while filling out the JSON object.

Here's another attempt at creating a JSON object based on the provided text:

```
{
  "id": "2865",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Folha de S.Paulo"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Not Listed",
  "description": "The text discusses various online resources and databases that can be used for investigative reporting, including those related to economy, demography, and science. These resources provide valuable information for research.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative reporting",
    "databases",
    "online research",
    "economy",
    "demography"
  ]
}
```
