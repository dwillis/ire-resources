Here is the JSON object based on the provided input:

```
{
  "id": "T2520",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigative Reporting Examples",
  "description": "The text provides examples of investigative reporting stories from various news organizations, including cases of corruption, scams, and misconduct. These stories were investigated by journalists and reported in different media outlets.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative reporting",
    "corruption",
    "scams",
    "misconduct",
    "journalism"
  ]
}
```

However, since there are multiple examples of investigative reporting in the text, I can create separate JSON objects for each one. Here is an example:

```
{
  "id": "T2520-1",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Diana Henriques",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The New York Times"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "2004",
  "title": "Captive Clientele",
  "description": "Some financial companies use unethical sales tactics to sell costly insurance and investment products to young military recruits. These companies have military and Congressional connections that help them grow their business.",
  "keywords": [
    "financial scams",
    "military recruits",
    "insurance",
    "investment products"
  ]
}
```

And another one:

```
{
  "id": "T2520-2",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Mike Wilkinson",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The (Toledo) Blade"
    },
    {
      "name": "James Drew",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The (Toledo) Blade"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "2005",
  "title": "State agency invests millions in rare coins",
  "description": "Ohio's government invested millions of dollars in rare coins, buying nickels, dimes, and pennies. The investment is managed by a local Republican and coin dealer.",
  "keywords": [
    "rare coins",
    "government investment",
    "Ohio"
  ]
}
```

Please let me know if you would like me to create separate JSON objects for each example or a single one that summarizes all of them.
