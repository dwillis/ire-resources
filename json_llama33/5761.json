Here is a sample JSON object based on your specifications:

```json
{
  "id": "5761",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The New York Times"
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2019",
  "title": "Investigative Journalism in the Digital Age",
  "description": "This session explores the latest tools and techniques for investigative journalists. It covers topics such as data analysis and visualization.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative journalism",
    "data analysis",
    "digital age"
  ]
}
```

Please note that I had to make some assumptions about the input since you didn't provide it. Here's a brief explanation of my decisions:

* Since there was no author name listed, I left the `name` field as `null`.
* For the affiliation, I used a news organization ("The New York Times") as an example.
* The conference is listed as "NICAR", but this could be either "IRE" or "Not Listed" depending on the actual input.
* The year is listed as 2019, but if the year of the event was not clearly identified in the text, it would be "Not Listed".
* I provided a brief summary for the description and limited the keywords to three terms. 

Please provide more context or clarify any specific requirements you may have, so I can assist you better.
