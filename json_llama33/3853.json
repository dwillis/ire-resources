Here is the JSON object based on the provided input:

```
{
  "id": "3853",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "This text does not provide a clear description, but it appears to be related to data manipulation and filtering in Excel.",
  "keywords": [
    "Excel",
    "data manipulation",
    "filtering"
  ]
}
```

Please note that I had to make some assumptions since the input text did not provide specific information about the authors, title, or conference. If you provide more context or clarify what you would like me to extract from the text, I can try to create a more accurate JSON object.

Here's a brief explanation of my decisions:

* `id`: Set to "3853" as specified.
* `authors`: Since there are no authors mentioned in the input text, I created a single author object with null values for name, email, and affiliation.
* `conference`: Set to "Not Listed" since the conference is not clearly identified in the input text.
* `year`: Set to "Not Listed" since the year of the event is not mentioned in the input text.
* `title`: Left as null since there is no clear title provided in the input text.
* `description`: Created a brief summary of the text, focusing on data manipulation and filtering in Excel.
* `keywords`: Extracted three relevant keywords: "Excel", "data manipulation", and "filtering". Let me know if you'd like me to add or modify these!
