Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "2999",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Nonprofit Financial Analysis",
  "description": "The text discusses the analysis of nonprofit financial data, including the use of ratios and the importance of considering mission impact. It highlights the limitations of relying solely on financial metrics to evaluate nonprofits.",
  "keywords": [
    "nonprofit finance",
    "financial analysis",
    "mission impact"
  ]
}
```

Note that I couldn't find any information about authors, conference, or year in the input text, so I left those fields with default values. The description is a brief summary of the text, and the keywords are a selection of relevant terms that exclude the conference and authors. Let me know if you have any further requests!
