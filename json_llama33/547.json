```

Note that I couldn't find any specific author names or email addresses in the provided text, so I left those fields as null. The affiliation is also null since there is no clear indication of an author's affiliation. The conference is listed as "IRE" based on the context of the document. The year is "Not Listed" since it is not explicitly mentioned in the text. The description provides a brief summary of the document, and the keywords are limited to three relevant terms.
