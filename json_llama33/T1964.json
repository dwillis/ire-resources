Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "T1964",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigative Reporting Resources",
  "description": "This text provides a list of resources and tips for investigative reporters, including websites, databases, and other tools. It covers various topics such as company research, SEC filings, and analyst reports.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative reporting",
    "company research",
    "SEC filings",
    "analyst reports",
    "research resources"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there is no author mentioned in the text, I left the `name` attribute as `null`. Also, since the year of the event is not clearly identified, I set the `year` attribute to `"Not Listed"`. The conference is assumed to be `"IRE"` based on the context. Let me know if you need any further changes!
