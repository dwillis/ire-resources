Here is the JSON object:

```
{
  "id": "4070",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text appears to be a jumbled collection of characters and symbols, with no clear meaning or summary. It does not contain any discernible information about a conference, authors, or keywords.",
  "keywords": []
}
```

Note: Since the input text is a jumbled collection of characters and symbols, I was unable to extract any meaningful information. Therefore, most of the fields are empty or set to "null" or "Not Listed". If you provide a different input text, I can try to create a more accurate JSON object.
