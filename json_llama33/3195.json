Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```

  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Investigative Reporters and Editors"
    },
    {
      "name": "James T. Hamilton",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2009",
  "title": "Computational Journalism",
  "description": "The text discusses the concept of computational journalism, which uses algorithms and data to generate watchdog coverage and personalize the impacts of public policies. It highlights the potential of this field in making journalism more efficient and effective.",
  "keywords": [
    "Computational Journalism",
    "Data Journalism",
    "Watchdog Coverage",
    "Toxics Release Inventory",
    "Environmental Policy"
  ]
}
```

Note that I've used "Investigative Reporters and Editors" as the affiliation for the first author, since it's mentioned in the text as the copyright holder. For James T. Hamilton, I couldn't find any email or affiliation listed, so I left those fields as null. The description is a brief summary of the text, and the keywords are a list of relevant terms that are not too specific or too general. Let me know if you have any further questions!
