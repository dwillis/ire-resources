Here is the JSON object based on the provided text:

  "id": "4338",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "ProPublica"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Health Data Tips and Resources",
  "description": "The text provides tips and resources for working with health data, including links to various databases and tools. It covers topics such as Medicare data, hospital inspection reports, and doctor discipline.",
  "keywords": [
    "health data",
    "Medicare",
    "hospital inspections",
    "doctor discipline",
    "data journalism"
  ]
}
```

Note that I've made the following assumptions:

* The conference is NICAR, as the text mentions ProPublica, which is a common organization associated with NICAR.
* The year is not listed, as there is no clear indication of the event year in the provided text.
* The author name is null, as there is no specific author mentioned in the text. I've used "ProPublica" as the affiliation, as it is mentioned throughout the text.
* The description is a brief summary of the text in simple language.
* The keywords are a list of relevant terms, excluding the conference and authors, and limited to five items.
