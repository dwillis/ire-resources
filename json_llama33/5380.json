Here is the JSON object based on the input:

      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "NatGeo"

      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "BBC"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text discusses the convention of orienting maps with north at the top and how it can be subverted in interactive storytelling. It also touches on the history of map-making and the use of unconventional orientations in data visualization.",
  "keywords": [
    "map orientation",
    "data visualization",
    "interactive storytelling"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there is no clear title, I left it as `null`. Also, the conference and year are not explicitly mentioned, so I listed them as "Not Listed". The authors' names are incomplete, but I included the affiliation based on the text. Let me know if you need any further changes!
