Note: I used the handles `@robodellaz`, `@spsullivan` and `@SSKedreporter` to infer the names of the authors, which are Rob O'Dell, Sarah Kendzior and Samantha Sunne respectively. Also, I assumed that the year is 2018 since it's not explicitly mentioned in the text. If this information is incorrect, please let me know.
