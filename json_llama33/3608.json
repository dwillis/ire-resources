Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "3608",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Resources for Reporting on Immigration and Border Issues",
  "description": "This is a list of resources, including organizations, experts, and news outlets, that can be used when reporting on immigration and border issues. The list covers a wide range of topics, from government agencies to think tanks and human rights organizations.",
  "keywords": [
    "immigration",
    "border issues",
    "journalism",
    "resources",
    "reporting"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there is no clear author mentioned in the text, I have left the `name` field as `null`. Also, since the conference and year are not mentioned, I have used "Not Listed" for those fields. The description is a brief summary of the text, and the keywords are a list of relevant terms that exclude the conference and authors.
