Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "3730",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "List of Medical and Healthcare Organizations' PACs",
  "description": "The text appears to be a list of medical and healthcare organizations' political action committees (PACs) with their corresponding financial information. The list includes various organizations, such as the American Academy of Dermatology and the American Physical Therapy Association.",
  "keywords": [
    "Medical Organizations",
    "Healthcare PACs",
    "Financial Information"
  ]
}
```

Note that I did not extract any author information since none was provided in the input. Also, the conference and year were listed as "Not Listed" since they were not clearly identified in the text. The description is a brief summary of the content, and the keywords are a selection of relevant terms excluding the conference and authors.
