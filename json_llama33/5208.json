Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "5208",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigative Reporting Resources",
  "description": "This text provides a list of resources and tools for investigative reporting, including websites, databases, and search engines. It covers topics such as business records, non-profits, natural disasters, and quick lookups.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative reporting",
    "research tools",
    "databases",
    "search engines"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there is no specific author mentioned in the text, I left the name as null. Also, since the conference and year are not clearly identified, I listed them as "Not Listed". The description is a brief summary of the text in simple language, and the keywords are a list of relevant terms excluding the conference and authors.
