Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "4606",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "9News"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigative Reporting Tips",
  "description": "The text provides tips and examples for conducting investigative interviews, including being prepared, staying calm, and following up with fact-checking. It also includes links to example news stories.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative reporting",
    "interview techniques",
    "fact-checking"
  ]
}
```

Note that I've made the following assumptions:

* The author is not listed, so I've left the name as null.
* The affiliation is 9News, which appears to be a news organization mentioned in the text.
* The conference and year are not clearly identified, so I've listed them as "Not Listed".
* The description is a brief summary of the text in simple language.
* The keywords are a list of relevant terms excluding the conference and authors.
