Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "3669",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text discusses various tools and resources for scraping data from websites, including IRE, NICAR, and other conferences. It also mentions different projects and their current status.",
  "keywords": [
    "web scraping",
    "data extraction",
    "journalism"
  ]
}
```

Note that since there were no specific authors mentioned in the text, I left the `name` attribute as `null`. If any news organizations were mentioned as potential affiliations, they could be added to the `affiliation` attribute. The `description` is a brief summary of the text, and the `keywords` are limited to five terms that exclude conference names and authors. Let me know if you need further modifications!
