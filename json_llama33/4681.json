Based on the provided instructions, I will create a JSON object with the specified keys and values. Here is the result:

```
{
  "id": "4681",
  "authors": [],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "",
  "description": "",
  "keywords": []
}
```

Since there is no text provided to extract information from, I have left the values empty or set to default values as specified in the instructions. If you provide the text, I can help fill in the values accordingly.

Please note that I'll need the text to extract the following information:

* Authors' names, emails, and affiliations
* Conference name (IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed)
* Year of the event (or Not Listed if not specified)
* Title of the article/presentation
* Description (1-2 sentence summary in simple language)
* Keywords (up to 5 terms excluding conference and authors)

Once I have this information, I can fill in the JSON object accordingly.
