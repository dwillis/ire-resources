Based on the input you provided (which appears to be empty), I will create a JSON object with the specified keys and default values.

```json
{
  "id": "4620",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "",
  "description": "",
  "keywords": []
}
```

Please provide the actual text or input, and I will update the JSON object accordingly. 

If you provide a specific text, I can try to extract the relevant information to fill in the JSON object. For example, if the text mentions authors, I can add them to the `authors` list with their respective attributes. If the text describes a conference or event, I can update the `conference` and `year` fields accordingly. 

Please provide more context or information about the input you would like me to work with.
