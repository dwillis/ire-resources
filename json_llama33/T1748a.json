Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "T1748a",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Creating a map with free tools",
  "description": "This text describes how to create a map using free tools, including ArcExplorer and OpenOffice. The process involves downloading Census maps, calculating percentages, and adding layers to the map.",
  "keywords": [
    "mapping",
    "data visualization",
    "Census data",
    "ArcExplorer",
    "OpenOffice"
  ]
}
```

Note that I've left the author's name, email, and affiliation as null since none were specified in the input text. The conference is listed as NICAR based on the mention of ArcExplorer, which is a tool commonly used at NICAR conferences. The year is listed as "Not Listed" since it was not clearly identified in the input text. The description provides a brief summary of the text, and the keywords are a list of relevant terms excluding the conference and authors.
