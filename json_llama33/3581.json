Note: Since there are no specific authors mentioned in the text, I left the author name as null. Also, since the conference and year are not clearly identified, I listed them as "Not Listed". The affiliation is a general term to encompass the various news organizations mentioned in the text. The description is a brief summary of the content, and the keywords are a selection of relevant terms that exclude the conference and authors.
