Here is the JSON object created from the input:

```
{
  "id": "4121",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Computerworld"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "2014",
  "title": "5 tips for data manipulation in Excel",
  "description": "The article provides tips on how to manipulate data in Excel. It includes various links to white papers and other resources.",
  "keywords": [
    "Excel",
    "data manipulation",
    "tips"
  ]
}
```

Note that I've used "Not Listed" for the conference since it's not explicitly mentioned in the text, and "Computerworld" as the affiliation for the author since it's a news organization. The description is a brief summary of the article in simple language, and the keywords are limited to three terms excluding the conference and authors. Let me know if you need any further adjustments!
