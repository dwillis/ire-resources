Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "T2481",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigating Political Influence and Campaign Finance",
  "description": "The text provides resources and tips for investigating political influence, campaign finance, and lobbying. It includes links to databases, websites, and other tools for tracking money in politics.",
  "keywords": [
    "campaign finance",
    "lobbying",
    "political influence",
    "investigative reporting",
    "government transparency"
  ]
}
```

Note that I assumed the conference as NICAR since the text seems to be related to investigative reporting and data journalism, which is consistent with the National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting (NICAR) conference. If you want me to change it to IRE or Not Listed, please let me know!
