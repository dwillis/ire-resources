Here is the JSON object based on the provided specifications:

```
{
  "id": "4116",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "This text does not provide enough information to create a summary. The original text is about using QGIS for data editing and mapping.",
  "keywords": [
    "QGIS",
    "data editing",
    "mapping"
  ]
}
```

Please note that I had to leave some fields as `null` because there was no relevant information provided in the original text. If you provide more context or details, I can help you fill in those fields. 

Also, please let me know if this meets your requirements or if I need to make any changes. 

Here's a brief explanation of how I filled in each field:

* `id`: You specified that the id should be 4116.
* `authors`: Since there were no authors mentioned in the text, I left the `name` field as `null`. The `email` and `affiliation` fields are also `null` because no information was provided.
* `conference`, `year`, and `title`: These fields were not explicitly mentioned in the text, so I used "Not Listed" for `conference` and `year`, and left `title` as `null`.
* `description`: I tried to create a brief summary of the text in simple language. The original text is about using QGIS for data editing and mapping.
* `keywords`: I extracted three relevant keywords from the text: "QGIS", "data editing", and "mapping". Let me know if you'd like me to add or modify any keywords!
