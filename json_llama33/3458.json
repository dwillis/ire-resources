}
```

Note that I've left the title as null since it's not explicitly mentioned in the input text. Also, I've used "NICAR" as the conference name based on the context, but if you want to use "IRE" or "Not Listed", please let me know. Similarly, I've assumed the year is 2011 based on the copyright notice at the end of the text, but if that's not correct, please provide more information.
