  "description": "The text provides tips and resources for investigating defense spending, including where to find useful documents and how to track funding shifts. It also includes examples of stories that have been written using these techniques.",
  "keywords": [
    "defense spending",
    "investigative reporting",
    "Pentagon budget",
    "military contracts",
    "government transparency"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there is no clear author mentioned in the text, I left the `name` attribute as `null`. Also, the year of the event is not clearly identified, so I set the `year` attribute to `"Not Listed"`. The conference is assumed to be NICAR based on the context, but it could also be IRE or Not Listed if more information was available.
