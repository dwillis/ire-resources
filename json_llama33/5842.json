Here is the JSON object based on the provided text:

```
{
  "id": "5842",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    },
    {
      "name": "Jeffrey Hermes",
      "email": "jhermes@medialaw.org",
      "affiliation": "Media Law Resource Center"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text discusses copyright law and fair use, particularly in the context of online content and social media. It covers topics such as licenses, assignments, and permissions, as well as relevant court cases.",
  "keywords": [
    "copyright law",
    "fair use",
    "online content",
    "social media",
    "licenses"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since the title is not explicitly mentioned in the text, I left it as `null`. Also, the conference and year are not clearly identified, so I listed them as "Not Listed". The keywords are a selection of relevant terms from the text. Let me know if you'd like me to make any changes!
