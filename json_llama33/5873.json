Here is the JSON object based on the input:

  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "KHOU"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Finding Government Data for Investigative Reporting",
  "description": "This text provides tips and resources for finding government data, including websites and databases that can be used for investigative reporting. It covers a range of topics, from voter data to federal contracts and inspector general reports.",
  "keywords": [
    "government data",
    "investigative reporting",
    "open records",
    "federal contracts",
    "voter data"
  ]
}
```

Note: I used NICAR as the conference since the text appears to be related to investigative reporting and data analysis, which is consistent with the National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting (NICAR) conference. If you have more information about the conference, please let me know and I can update the JSON object accordingly.
