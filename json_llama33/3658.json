Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "3658",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "",
  "description": "",
  "keywords": []
}
```

Since there is no input text provided, I had to leave most of the fields empty. If you provide the actual input text, I can help fill in the correct values.

Please note that I've assumed the following:

* `id` is a string and not an integer, as it's enclosed in quotes.
* `authors` is a list containing at least one element, even if there is no author information available.
* `conference`, `year`, `title`, `description`, and `keywords` are all strings or lists of strings, as specified.

If you provide the actual input text, I can help fill in the correct values for each field.
