Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "T2718",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigative Research Tips",
  "description": "This text provides tips and resources for investigative research, including how to find information on companies and non-profit organizations. It covers various sources of information, such as government agencies, watchdog groups, and internal documents.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative research",
    "companies",
    "non-profit organizations",
    "government agencies",
    "watchdog groups"
  ]
}
```

Note that I assumed the conference to be "IRE" based on the style of the text, which appears to be a tipsheet from the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. If this is incorrect, please let me know and I will update the JSON object accordingly.
