To create the JSON object as requested from the provided information about an article or news story, we need to break down the requirements into their respective parts and fill them out accordingly.

Given that no specific details are provided about the authors, conference, year, title, description, or keywords of the article in question, I will demonstrate how to construct such a JSON object with placeholder values where actual information is not given. This example assumes you're dealing with an article from "The Tennis Racket" by BuzzFeed and the BBC, mentioned earlier.

```json
{
  "id": "5392",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "BuzzFeed"
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "BBC"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "The Tennis Racket",
  "description": "An investigative story about tennis, published by BuzzFeed and the BBC. It explores issues within the sport.",
  "keywords": [
    "Tennis",
    "Investigation",
    "Sports"
  ]
}
```

In this example:
- `id` is set to `"5392"` as per your request.
- `authors` are listed with placeholder names (`null`) and affiliations based on the news organizations mentioned (BuzzFeed and BBC).
- `conference` is set to `"Not Listed"` since no conference information was provided.
- `year` is also set to `"Not Listed"` due to lack of specific year information.
- `title` uses the title "The Tennis Racket" from one of the examples given.
- `description` provides a brief summary of what such an article might be about, in simple language.
- `keywords` are limited to three terms (`"Tennis"`, `"Investigation"`, and `"Sports"`), excluding the conference and authors as requested.

Remember, this is a placeholder example. For actual use, you would replace these values with real information from your specific article or data source.
