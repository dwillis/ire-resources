Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "5476",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Accessing Health and Education Data",
  "description": "This text provides information on how to access health and education data, including tips on navigating FERPA and HIPAA laws. It also discusses the types of data that can be requested from schools and healthcare institutions.",
  "keywords": [
    "health data",
    "education data",
    "FERPA",
    "HIPAA"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there are no specific authors mentioned in the input text, I have left the `name` field as `null`. Also, since the conference and year are not clearly identified, I have listed them as "Not Listed". The description is a brief summary of the text in simple language. Let me know if you need any further changes!
