Here is the JSON object with the requested information:

```
{
  "id": "4281",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Research Resources for Journalists",
  "description": "This text provides a list of online resources and tools that journalists can use to research various topics, including government data, public records, and more. The resources include websites, databases, and other tools that can help journalists find information and conduct investigations.",
  "keywords": [
    "research resources",
    "journalism tools",
    "government data",
    "public records"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there is no specific author mentioned in the text, I have left the `name` attribute as `null`. Similarly, since there is no clear indication of the year or conference (although it appears to be related to NICAR), I have used "Not Listed" for those attributes. The description is a brief summary of the content, and the keywords are a selection of relevant terms that exclude the conference and authors.
