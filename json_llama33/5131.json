Here is the JSON object based on the provided input:

```
{
  "id": "5131",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "news organization"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text provides tips and advice for reporters and editors on how to work effectively together, including communication, time management, and building trust. It also discusses common problems that may arise and suggests solutions.",
  "keywords": [
    "reporting",
    "editing",
    "communication",
    "time management",
    "trust"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there is no specific title mentioned in the text, I left it as null. Also, since the conference and year are not clearly identified, I listed them as "Not Listed". The authors' names are not provided, so I left them as null. The affiliation is listed as "news organization" since that is mentioned in the context of the text. Let me know if you'd like me to revise anything!
