Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "5308",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": "julian.sher@cbc.ca",
      "affiliation": "CBC"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2017",
  "title": "The Art of Investigative Story-Telling",
  "description": "This presentation provides tips on how to tell a story, not just present research. It covers topics such as plotting the journey of characters, using the four Cs of character development, and structuring an investigative story.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative storytelling",
    "storytelling techniques",
    "character development",
    "story structure"
  ]
}
```

Note that I assumed the conference is "IRE" based on the mention of "IRE Tipsheets" in the text, and the year is "2017" based on the same mention. I also used "CBC" as the affiliation since it is mentioned as the sender's email domain. Let me know if you have any further questions!
