Here is the JSON object based on the provided text:

```
{
  "id": "tipsheet",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "IRE"
    },
    {
      "name": "George",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "This text provides tips and tutorials on how to customize and deploy Chartbuilder, a data visualization tool. It covers topics such as changing fonts, colors, and adding logos.",
  "keywords": [
    "Chartbuilder",
    "data visualization",
    "customization",
    "deployment"
  ]
}
```

Note that I've left the `name` field null for the first author since no name was mentioned in the text. I've also used "IRE" as the affiliation for the first author, but this might not be accurate since it's not clear if the author is affiliated with IRE or if it's just a conference mention. Additionally, I've listed "George" as an author since they are mentioned in the text as providing a tutorial. The `title` field is null since no title was provided in the text.
