Here is the JSON object based on your requirements:

```
{
  "id": "4741",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": null,
  "keywords": []
}
```

Please provide the text that needs to be summarized, and I will fill in the details. 

Also, please note that without any specific information about authors, conference, year, title, description, or keywords, this is the most basic JSON object I can create based on your requirements.

If you provide more context, I'll do my best to fill in the details accurately.
