Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "5156",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text does not provide enough information to create a summary. It appears to be a guide on how to use Cometdocs, a document conversion and sharing platform.",
  "keywords": [
    "Cometdocs",
    "document conversion",
    "file sharing"
  ]
}
```

Please note that I had to leave many fields as `null` or `"Not Listed"` since the input text does not provide enough information to fill them in. If you have any further questions or need more clarification, feel free to ask!
