  "year": "2002",

    "data journalism",
    "investigative reporting",
    "Denmark",

}
```

Note: I've used "Not Listed" for the conference as it's not explicitly mentioned in the text. Also, I've only included two authors, one with a null name and affiliation "Dicar" (which seems to be a typo or abbreviation), and another with name "Tommy Ritzau" and affiliation "The Danish News Agency /ritzau/". If there are other authors mentioned in the text, please let me know and I'll add them to the list.
