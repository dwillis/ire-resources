Note that I've left the author information blank since there is no specific author mentioned in the text. Also, I've assumed the conference to be NICAR (National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting) based on the content of the text, but it could also be IRE (Investigative Reporters and Editors). If you have more information about the conference, please let me know and I can update the JSON object accordingly.
