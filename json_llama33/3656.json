Here is the JSON object based on the provided input:

      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],

  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "This text appears to be a tutorial on using PowerPivot, a data analysis tool. It provides step-by-step instructions on how to use the tool.",
  "keywords": [
    "PowerPivot",

  ]
}

Note that I had to make some assumptions since there was no clear information about the authors, title, and other details. If you provide more context or clarify what you would like me to extract from the text, I can help you create a more accurate JSON object.
