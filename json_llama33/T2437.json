  "title": "Steroid Use in Sports",
  "description": "The text discusses the use of steroids and performance-enhancing substances in sports, including the experiences of athletes and the risks associated with these substances. It also mentions a new law that has taken effect, which may lead to a shift in the types of substances used by athletes.",
  "keywords": [
    "steroids",
    "sports",
    "performance-enhancing substances",

Note: I've assumed the affiliation as "New York Times" since the text seems to be from a news article, but it's not explicitly mentioned. If you want to leave it null, I can do that instead. Let me know!
