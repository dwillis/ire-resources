Note: Since there is no explicit mention of an author's name, I have left it as `null`. Also, the conference is assumed to be NICAR based on the context, but if you're sure it's a different conference (e.g., IRE), please let me know. The year is listed as "Not Listed" since it's not explicitly mentioned in the text.
