Here is the JSON object based on the provided text:

```
{
  "id": "T576",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Unknown",
  "description": "The text appears to be a collection of unrelated documents, including a deed with a vendor's lien and a list of names. It does not provide a clear topic or summary.",
  "keywords": [
    "deed",
    "vendor's lien",
    "property"
  ]
}
```

Note that I couldn't find any specific information about the authors, conference, year, title, or keywords in the provided text, so I left those fields as null or "Not Listed" where applicable. The description is a brief summary of the content, and the keywords are a few terms that seem relevant to the text. Let me know if you have any further questions!
