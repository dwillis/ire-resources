}
```

Note that I left the `name` field in the `authors` list as `null` since there is no author mentioned in the text. Similarly, I left the `title` field as `null` since there is no clear title mentioned in the text. The `conference` and `year` fields are also set to "Not Listed" since this information is not present in the text. Let me know if you need any further modifications!
