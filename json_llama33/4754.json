Here is the JSON object based on the provided input:

      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "List of Resources for Investigating Agriculture and Food Systems",
  "description": "This is a list of resources, including organizations, experts, and news outlets, that can be used to investigate agriculture and food systems. The list covers various topics such as genetically modified organisms, wine, and endangered species.",
  "keywords": [
    "agriculture",
    "food systems",
    "investigative reporting",
    "resources",
    "experts"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there are no specific authors mentioned in the text, I have left the `name` field as `null`. Also, since the conference and year are not specified, I have used "Not Listed" for those fields. The description is a brief summary of the text in simple language. The keywords are a list of five relevant terms that exclude the conference and authors.
