Note: Since the text does not mention any specific author names, I have left the `name` field as `null`. The affiliation is assumed to be "Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE)" based on the context of the text. The description is a brief summary of the text in simple language. The keywords are limited to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Let me know if you need any further modifications!
