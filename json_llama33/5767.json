Here is the JSON object based on the provided specifications:

```
{
  "id": "5767",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "",
  "description": "",
  "keywords": []
}
```

Since there is no text provided to summarize, I left the description and title empty. Also, I didn't include any authors or keywords as none were specified. If you provide the actual text, I can help fill in the details accordingly. 

Please note that the `id` is set to "5767" as per your request, but in a typical JSON object, IDs are usually numeric and not strings. If you want it to be a number, you can remove the quotes around it.

If you provide more information or context about the text, I'll be happy to help create a more accurate JSON object. 

Also, here is an example of what the JSON object might look like if we had some sample text:

```
{
  "id": "5767",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The New York Times"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2020",
  "title": "Investigative Journalism Conference",
  "description": "A conference for investigative journalists to share their findings and learn from each other. The event featured discussions on data journalism and freedom of information.",
  "keywords": ["investigative journalism", "data journalism", "freedom of information"]
}
```

Let me know if you have any further questions or need help with anything else!
