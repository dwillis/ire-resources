Here is the JSON object based on the input:

  "keywords": [
    "energy",
    "data journalism",
    "storytelling"
  ]
}
```

Note: I assumed the conference is "CAR" based on the text "CAR16", but it's not clear if this is an abbreviation for a specific conference. If you have more information about the conference, please let me know and I can update the JSON object accordingly. Also, since there are no explicit names mentioned in the text, I left the "name" field as null for each author.
