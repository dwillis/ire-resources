Here is the JSON object based on the provided input:

```
{
  "id": "3480",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "",
  "description": "The text appears to be a collection of demographic and population statistics, including data on age, ethnicity, and growth rates. It does not seem to describe a specific event or research paper.",
  "keywords": [
    "demographics",
    "population statistics",
    "growth rates"
  ]
}
```

Note that I've left the `name` field in the `authors` list as `null`, since there are no author names mentioned in the input text. Similarly, I've set `conference` and `year` to "Not Listed", since this information is not provided in the text. The `description` is a brief summary of the content, and the `keywords` list includes three terms that seem relevant to the topic. Let me know if you have any further requests!
