Here is the JSON object based on the input:

  "keywords": [
    "diversity",
    "journalism",
    "inclusion",
    "representation",
    "media"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there are no specific author names mentioned in the text, I left the `name` field as `null`. Also, since the year and conference are not clearly identified, I listed them as "Not Listed". The affiliation is based on the news organizations mentioned in the text. Let me know if you'd like me to make any changes!
