Here is the JSON object:

```
{
  "id": "4510_1",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "List of News Organizations with Investigative Pages",
  "description": "The text provides a list of news organizations with their respective investigative pages. The list includes various cities and news channels.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative journalism",
    "news organizations",
    "media outlets"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there are no specific authors mentioned in the text, I have left the `name` field as `null`. Also, since the conference and year are not specified, I have used "Not Listed" for those fields. The description is a brief summary of the text, and the keywords are relevant terms that exclude the conference and authors.
