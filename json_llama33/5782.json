Here is the JSON object based on the provided text:

```
{
  "id": "5782",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "David Montgomery",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "News Organization"
    },
    {
      "name": "Allie Kanik",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "News Organization"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2019",
  "title": "Merging CSVs",
  "description": "This text provides tips and code snippets for merging CSV files using different programming languages, including R and Python. It also introduces a crowdsourced project to collect useful code snippets.",
  "keywords": [
    "CSV",
    "R",
    "Python",
    "Data Journalism",
    "Code Snippets"
  ]
}
```

Note that the year is not clearly identified in the text, but based on the context and the fact that NICAR conferences are typically held annually, I assumed a recent year. If you'd like to change it to "Not Listed", please let me know.

Also, I used "News Organization" as the affiliation for both authors since their actual affiliations were not specified in the text, but they mentioned their Twitter handles and GitHub profiles which suggest they are involved with news organizations.
