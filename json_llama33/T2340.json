Here is the JSON object based on the provided input:

```
{
  "id": "T2340",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "This text provides a list of resources and websites related to human rights, crime, and news in Mexico. It includes links to various organizations, news sites, and databases.",
  "keywords": [
    "Mexico",
    "human rights",
    "crime",
    "news",
    "resources"
  ]
}
```

Note that I've left the `name` field as `null` since there are no author names mentioned in the text. Similarly, I've set `title` to `null` since there is no clear title provided. The `conference` and `year` fields are also set to "Not Listed" since this information is not available. The `description` field provides a brief summary of the text, and the `keywords` field lists five relevant terms.
