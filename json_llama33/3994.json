Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "3994",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Regex Tutorial for Data Journalists",
  "description": "This text provides a tutorial on using regular expressions for data journalists, covering topics such as pattern matching and replacement. It includes examples and exercises to help learners practice their skills.",
  "keywords": [
    "regex",
    "data journalism",
    "text processing"
  ]
}
```

Note that since there is no author information provided in the input, I left the `name` field as `null`. Also, since the year of the event is not clearly identified, I set the `year` field to `"Not Listed"`. The conference is set to `"NICAR"` based on the context of the tutorial. Let me know if you need any further modifications!
