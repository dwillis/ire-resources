Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "T2362",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text appears to be a collection of statistical data and tables, but there is no clear summary or description. It seems to be related to demographic information.",
  "keywords": [
    "statistics",
    "demographics",
    "data"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since the input text does not provide any specific information about the authors, title, conference, year, or keywords, I had to leave those fields blank or use default values. If you have more context or information about the input text, please let me know and I can try to create a more accurate JSON object.
