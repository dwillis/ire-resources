Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "3224",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "This text describes the transition from Excel 2003 to Excel 2007, including new features and how to use them. It provides a guide for users who are upgrading to the new version.",
  "keywords": [
    "Excel",
    "Microsoft Office",
    "software upgrade"
  ]
}
```

Note that I've left some fields as `null` since there was no information provided in the input text. If you'd like me to fill in any of these fields with default values or make any changes, please let me know! 

Here's a brief explanation of my decisions:

* `id`: Set to "3224" as specified.
* `authors`: Since there were no authors mentioned, I left the name, email, and affiliation as `null`.
* `conference`: Set to "Not Listed" since there was no clear indication of which conference this text is related to.
* `year`: Set to "Not Listed" since the year of the event was not clearly identified.
* `title`: Left as `null` since there was no title provided in the input text.
* `description`: Provided a brief summary of the text in simple language.
* `keywords`: Chose three relevant keywords that exclude the conference and authors. Let me know if you'd like me to add or modify any of these!
