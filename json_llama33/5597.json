Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "5597",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "FOIA and Open Records Guide",
  "description": "This text provides a guide on how to make Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and open records requests, including tips and resources for navigating the process. It covers topics such as writing effective requests, appealing denials, and using online resources.",
  "keywords": [
    "FOIA",
    "open records",
    "government transparency",
    "journalism",
    "investigative reporting"
  ]
}
```

Note that since there are no authors mentioned in the text, I left the `name` attribute as `null`. Also, since the conference and year are not clearly identified, I used "Not Listed" for those values. Let me know if you have any further questions or if this meets your requirements!
