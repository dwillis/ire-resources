Note: Since there is no author mentioned in the text, I have left the name as null. Also, I have not included any names of news organizations as affiliations since none were mentioned. The conference is listed as "IRE" since it seems to be related to the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) organization, but if this is incorrect, please let me know. The year is listed as "Not Listed" since it was not clearly identified in the text.
