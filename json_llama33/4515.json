Note: Since there are no authors mentioned in the text, I left the `name` attribute as `null`. If you want to include a news organization as the affiliation, please let me know which one to use. Also, I assumed the conference is NICAR since it seems related to investigative reporting and data analysis. If you think it's IRE or Not Listed, please correct me!
