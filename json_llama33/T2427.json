Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "T2427",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "IRE"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text provides tips and guidelines for journalists on how to conduct investigative reporting, including writing, editing, and presenting stories. It also includes examples of interactive projects and online tools.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative reporting",
    "writing",
    "editing",
    "online tools"
  ]
}
```

However, I noticed that there are two authors mentioned in the text: 

* Education is not mentioned but based on context it appears to be part of a conference presentation for journalists. 
* The authors appear to be associated with news organizations, specifically "IRE" (Investigative Reporters and Editors). Two email addresses were listed, one belonging to someone at the Philadelphia Inquirer.

Here's an updated version:

```
{
  "id": "T2427",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": "someone@philadelphia.inquirer.com",
      "affiliation": "Philadelphia Inquirer"
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": "someone@example.com",
      "affiliation": "IRE"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text provides tips and guidelines for journalists on how to conduct investigative reporting, including writing, editing, and presenting stories. It also includes examples of interactive projects and online tools.",
  "keywords": [

    "writing",
