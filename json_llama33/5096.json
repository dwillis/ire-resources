Here is the JSON object based on the provided input:

```
{
  "id": "5096",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "This text is about regular expressions, a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. It explains the basics and provides resources for further learning.",
  "keywords": [
    "regular expressions",
    "regex",
    "pattern matching"
  ]
}
```

Please note that I had to make some assumptions since there was no specific information provided about the authors, conference, year, or title. If you provide more context or details, I can update the JSON object accordingly. 

Also, please let me know if you need any further modifications or have any specific requirements for the description and keywords. 

Here is a brief explanation of how I arrived at this JSON object:

* Since there was no author information provided, I left the name as null and email and affiliation as null.
* The conference was listed as "Not Listed" since it was not specified in the input text.
* The year was also listed as "Not Listed" for the same reason.
* I generated a brief description of the text, focusing on the main topic of regular expressions.
* For keywords, I chose three relevant terms that summarize the content: "regular expressions", "regex", and "pattern matching". Let me know if you need any adjustments to these.
