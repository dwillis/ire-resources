Note: Since there is no author mentioned in the text, I have left the name as null. Also, the year of the event is not clearly identified, so I have marked it as "Not Listed". The conference is NICAR, which is mentioned in the text. The description is a brief summary of the content in simple language. The keywords are a list of relevant terms excluding the conference and authors.
