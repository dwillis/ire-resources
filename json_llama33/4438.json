Here is the JSON object based on the provided specifications:

```
{
  "id": "4438",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "This text does not provide enough information to create a summary. The original text is about scraping complex web pages and using the web inspector to examine how files are passed between the server and the browser.",
  "keywords": [
    "web scraping",
    "complex scrapes",
    "web inspector"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there was no specific information provided in the prompt about the authors, title, or other details, I have left those fields as null or "Not Listed" where applicable. The description is a general summary of the text, and the keywords are based on the content of the original text. If more information were provided, I could update the JSON object accordingly.
