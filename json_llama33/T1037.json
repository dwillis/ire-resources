Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "T1037",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text provides a list of online resources for investigative journalists, covering topics such as business, military, environment, and health. It includes links to various websites and databases that can be used for research.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative journalism",
    "online resources",
    "research tools"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there is no clear author name or affiliation mentioned in the text, I have left the authors list with a single element containing null values. Similarly, since there is no title or conference/year information provided, I have set those fields to null or "Not Listed" respectively. The description provides a brief summary of the text, and the keywords are a selection of relevant terms that exclude the conference and authors.
