Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "5180",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigating Pollution",
  "description": "The text describes how to investigate pollution stories, including finding sources and understanding technical terms. It also highlights the importance of considering the people affected by pollution.",
  "keywords": [
    "pollution",
    "investigation",
    "environmental reporting"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there is no clear author mentioned in the text, I have left the name as null. Also, the year and conference are not clearly identified, so I have used "Not Listed" for the year and made an educated guess about the conference being "IRE" based on the context of the text. If more information is available, these values can be updated accordingly.
