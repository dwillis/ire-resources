Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "T1489a",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "News Organization"
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": "hcfa.gov",
      "affiliation": "Health Care Finance Administration"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Government Data Sources",
  "description": "The text provides a list of government data sources, including websites and databases for various topics such as transportation, education, and finance. These sources can be used to gather information and statistics on different subjects.",
  "keywords": [
    "government data",
    "data sources",
    "statistics",
    "education",
    "finance"
  ]
}
```

However, upon closer inspection of the text, I see that there are two specific authors mentioned: 

* One from News Organization (Writer is not specified but has an affiliation with a news organization), 
* Another author "James" is not listed but email for Writer from NASA and other emails are listed.

Also, note that year can be assumed to be around the time when data was available on the internet or in this case when certain websites started operating like http://www.fec.gov/ which began operations around 1997. So it should be between "1993" (when some of these databases were first made available) and "2004". However, we do not have enough information to give a definitive answer for year.
