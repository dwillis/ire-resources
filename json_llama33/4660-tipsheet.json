Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "tipsheet",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Tips for Working with Census Data",
  "description": "This tipsheet provides guidance on working with American Community Survey (ACS) data, including how to access and use the data, common mistakes to avoid, and tricks for making the process easier. It also highlights several tools and resources available from the US Census Bureau.",
  "keywords": [
    "Census Data",
    "ACS",
    "Data Analysis",
    "US Census Bureau"
  ]
}
```

Note that I assumed the conference was NICAR based on the content, but if you have more information about the context, please let me know and I can adjust accordingly. Also, since there were no authors mentioned in the text, I left the authors field with a single null entry. Let me know if you'd like me to change anything!
