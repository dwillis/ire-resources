Here is the JSON object based on the input:

  "authors": [

      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text describes how to use VLOOKUP in Excel to compare Medicare Advantage penetration in 2014 to the 2013 rate. It provides step-by-step instructions on how to prepare data and use the VLOOKUP function.",
  "keywords": [
    "VLOOKUP",
    "Excel",
    "Medicare Advantage"
  ]
}
```

Note that I didn't include any author information since none was provided in the text. I also left the title as null since there wasn't a clear title mentioned in the text. The conference is listed as NICAR, which appears to be the relevant conference based on the context of the text. Let me know if you have any further requests!
