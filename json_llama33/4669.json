Here is the JSON object based on the provided text:

      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Learning SQL for Data Journalism",
  "description": "This text provides an introduction to SQL and its applications in data journalism, including querying and manipulating data. It also includes examples and resources for further learning.",
  "keywords": [
    "SQL",
    "data journalism",
    "querying",
    "manipulating data"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there is no author mentioned in the text, I have left the name as null. Also, the year of the event is not clearly identified, so I have put it as "Not Listed". The conference is NICAR as it is mentioned in the resources section with a link to CodeAcademy's SQL course. Let me know if you'd like me to make any changes!
