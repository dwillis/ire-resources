Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "T2711",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "2006",
  "title": "Using the Public Information Act in Texas",
  "description": "This text provides guidance on how to use the Public Information Act in Texas to obtain government records and data. It includes tips and examples for reporters to get started with using the act.",
  "keywords": [
    "Public Information Act",
    "Texas",
    "government records",
    "reporting",
    "investigative journalism"
  ]
}
```

Note that since there is no author mentioned in the text, I left the `name` field as `null`. Also, I extracted the year from the mention of the conference date ("December 5-7, 2006"). Let me know if you have any further questions or if this meets your requirements!
