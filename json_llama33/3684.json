  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Public Records Request Tips",
  "description": "The text provides tips and examples for making public records requests, including how to request personnel and payroll databases. It also includes a sample records request form.",
  "keywords": [
    "public records",
    "Freedom of Information",
    "journalism",
    "investigative reporting",
    "data journalism"
  ]
}
```

Note: I assumed the conference is NICAR (National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting) since the text mentions RCW 42.56, which is a Washington state law, and NICAR is often associated with investigative reporting and data journalism. If this is incorrect, please let me know and I can change it to "Not Listed" or another conference if specified.
