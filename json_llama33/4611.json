Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "4611",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Police Killings and Court Records",
  "description": "The text appears to be a collection of data and records related to police killings, court cases, and administrative office information. It includes various tables and lists with names, dates, and other details.",
  "keywords": [
    "police killings",
    "court records",
    "administrative office"
  ]
}
```

Note that I had to make some assumptions about the input data, as it appears to be a collection of unrelated tables and lists. If you could provide more context or clarify what specific information you would like me to extract, I may be able to create a more accurate JSON object.
