Here is the JSON object based on the input:

  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Backgrounding and Corporate Research Tips",
  "description": "This text provides tips and resources for backgrounding and corporate research, including tools for searching SEC filings, lobbying records, and other databases. It also suggests ways to find sources and investigate companies and individuals.",
  "keywords": [
    "backgrounding",
    "corporate research",
    "SEC filings",
    "lobbying records",
    "investigative journalism"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there is no specific author mentioned in the text, I left the `name` field as `null`. Also, I chose `NICAR` as the conference since it seems to be related to investigative reporting and research. If you want me to change anything, please let me know!
