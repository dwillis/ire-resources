Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "5475",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "University of Michigan Health System"
    },
    {
      "name": "Annie Nguyen",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Not Listed"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2022",
  "title": "Getting health data despite HIPAA",
  "description": "This presentation discusses how to obtain health data despite the restrictions imposed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). It covers methods for de-identifying data and obtaining limited-use datasets.",
  "keywords": [
    "HIPAA",
    "health data",
    "de-identified data",
    "limited-use datasets"
  ]
}
```

However, I realized that the original prompt does not provide enough information to fill in all the fields. Here is a revised version with more accurate information:

```
{
  "id": "5475",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Getting health data despite HIPAA",
  "description": "This text discusses how to obtain health data despite the restrictions imposed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). It covers methods for de-identifying data and obtaining limited-use datasets.",
  "keywords": [
    "HIPAA",
    "health data",
    "de-identified data"
  ]
}
```
