}
```

Note that I didn't find any specific author names or email addresses in the text, so I left those fields as null. Also, since the year of the event is not clearly identified, I set the year to "Not Listed". The conference is set to "NICAR" based on the style and content of the text, but if you have more information about the context, you may want to adjust this field accordingly.
