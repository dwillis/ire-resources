Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "5856",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "This text provides guidance on managing online presence, including searching for personal information, setting up two-factor authentication, and modifying social media privacy settings. It also includes tips for using search operators and discovering old or impersonation accounts.",
  "keywords": [
    "online presence",
    "privacy settings",
    "two-factor authentication",
    "search operators"
  ]
}
```

Note: I've left the `title` field as `null` since there was no clear title mentioned in the input. Also, I've assumed that the `conference` is "Not Listed" since it's not explicitly mentioned. If you have any further information or clarification, please let me know!
