Here is the JSON object:

```
{
  "id": "T2071",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigative Reporting Resources",
  "description": "This text provides a list of resources and tools for investigative reporters, including search engines, directories, and news databases. It also includes tips on how to use these tools effectively.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative reporting",
    "search engines",
    "directories",
    "news databases",
    "research tools"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there are no specific authors mentioned in the text, I left the name as null. Also, I assumed the conference to be NICAR based on the mentions of IRE and NICAR in the text, but it could also be IRE or Not Listed depending on the context. The year is not clearly identified, so I listed it as "Not Listed". Let me know if you need any further changes!
