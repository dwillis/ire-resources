Based on the provided text, here is the JSON object:

```
{
  "id": "T2344",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "This text appears to be a tutorial or guide for using Access, a database management system. It covers various topics such as querying, calculations, and Boolean logic.",
  "keywords": [
    "Access",
    "database management",
    "querying",
    "calculations"
  ]
}
```

Note that I've left the `name` field in the `authors` list as `null` since there are no authors mentioned in the text. Similarly, I've set `title` to `null` since there is no clear title mentioned in the text. The `conference` and `year` fields are set to "Not Listed" since this information is not provided in the text. The `description` field provides a brief summary of the text, and the `keywords` list includes relevant terms excluding the conference and authors.
