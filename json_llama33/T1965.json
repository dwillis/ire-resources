Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "T1965",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Finding Public Records",
  "description": "The text describes various ways to find public records and information about individuals and organizations. It provides a long list of potential sources of public information.",
  "keywords": [
    "public records",
    "investigative reporting",
    "research"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there is no author mentioned in the text, I left the name as null. Also, since the conference and year are not clearly identified, I listed them as "Not Listed". The description is a brief summary of the text, and the keywords are a selection of relevant terms that are not too specific or too general.
