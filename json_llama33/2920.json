  "year": "2007",
  "title": "Tipsheet on Court Records",
  "description": "This tipsheet provides information on how to search for civil and criminal court records, including docket searches, judgments, and liens. It also discusses the limitations of these searches and the importance of verifying information.",
  "keywords": [
    "court records",
    "docket searches",
    "judgments",
    "liens",
    "criminal records"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there is no author name mentioned in the text, I left it as `null`. Also, I chose NICAR as the conference since the text mentions "NICAR" at the end. If this is incorrect, please let me know and I'll change it to "Not Listed".
