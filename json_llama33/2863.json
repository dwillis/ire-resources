Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "2863",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Research Resources for Investigating Terrorism and National Security",
  "description": "The text provides a list of resources for researching terrorism and national security, including websites, databases, and documents. These resources can be used to investigate topics such as foreign military sales, strategic intelligence, and terrorism laws.",
  "keywords": [
    "terrorism",
    "national security",
    "research resources",
    "investigative journalism",
    "government documents"
  ]
}
```

Note that I had to make some assumptions about the title and description, as they were not explicitly stated in the input. Also, since there was no clear author or affiliation mentioned, I left those fields null. Let me know if you'd like me to revise anything!
