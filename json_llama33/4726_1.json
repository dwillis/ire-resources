Here is the JSON object based on the provided input:

      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",

  "title": "Creating a Flythrough in Google Earth",
  "description": "This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to create a flythrough in Google Earth using paths and markers. The tutorial covers topics such as setting up the tour, arranging items, and rendering video.",
  "keywords": [
    "Google Earth",
    "Flythrough",
    "Tutorial",
    "Geospatial Visualization"
  ]
}
```

Note that since there is no author information provided in the input text, I have left the `name` field as `null`. Similarly, since the conference and year are not explicitly mentioned, I have listed them as "Not Listed". The description provides a brief summary of the content in simple language. The keywords are limited to five terms and exclude the conference and authors.
