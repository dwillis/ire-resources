      "affiliation": "Investigative Reporters and Editors"

  "keywords": [
    "FOIA",
    "Freedom of Information Act",
    "public records",

  ]
}
```

Note that I've used "Investigative Reporters and Editors" as the affiliation since it's mentioned in the text, but no specific author name is provided. Also, I've limited the keywords to five terms as per your request. Let me know if you need any further modifications!
