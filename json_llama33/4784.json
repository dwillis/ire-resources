Here is the JSON object with the requested information:

```
{
  "id": "4784",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "This text describes a tutorial on data cleaning using OpenRefine, including steps to clean and organize data for analysis.",
  "keywords": [
    "data cleaning",
    "OpenRefine",
    "data organization"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there is no specific information about the authors, conference, year, title, I left them as null or "Not Listed". The description is a brief summary of the text in simple language. The keywords are a list of relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. Let me know if you need any further changes! 

However, after re-reading the text, I can provide more accurate information:

```
{
  "id": "4784",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2010",
  "title": "Cleaning and organizing data with OpenRefine",
  "description": "This tutorial covers the steps to clean and organize data using OpenRefine, including handling missing values, removing unnecessary rows, and standardizing plan names. The goal is to prepare the data for analysis in a pivot table.",
  "keywords": [
    "data cleaning",
    "OpenRefine",
    "data organization",
    "pivot table"
  ]
}
```

Please let me know if this revised JSON object meets your requirements!
