Here is the JSON object based on the provided text:

```
{
  "id": "T1999",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "IRE"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Job Search",
  "description": "The IRE site posts job listings, and this script is designed to scrape those listings. The script follows links to job detail pages and prints the content.",
  "keywords": [
    "job search",
    "web scraping",
    "perl"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there are no specific authors mentioned in the text, I left the name as null. The affiliation is listed as "IRE" since it's a news organization mentioned in the text. The year is not clearly identified, so I listed it as "Not Listed". The description is a brief summary of the text, and the keywords are a list of relevant terms excluding the conference and authors.
