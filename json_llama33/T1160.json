Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "T1160",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "2000",
  "title": "Tracking Campaign Contributions",
  "description": "The text describes a resource for tracking campaign contributions and provides information on how to use the OpenSecrets.org website. The website offers various tools and data for researching political contributions and their connections to issues being debated in Congress.",
  "keywords": [
    "campaign finance",
    "political contributions",
    "OpenSecrets.org"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there is no explicit author mentioned in the text, I have left the `name` attribute as `null`. Similarly, since there is no clear conference or affiliation mentioned, I have used `"Not Listed"` for the `conference` and `null` for the `affiliation`. The year is assumed to be 2000 based on the mention of "Election 2000" in the text. Let me know if you'd like me to make any changes!
