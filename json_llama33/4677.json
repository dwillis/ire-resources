Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "4677",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2016",
  "title": "Basic Statistics and Data Analysis for Journalists",
  "description": "This tutorial covers basic statistics and data analysis concepts for journalists, including correlation, regression, and statistical significance. It uses examples from an NFL dataset to illustrate these concepts.",
  "keywords": [
    "statistics",
    "data analysis",
    "journalism",
    "regression",
    "significance"
  ]
}
```

Note that I made the following assumptions:

* The author is not listed, so I left the name as null.
* The conference is NICAR, based on the text mentioning "NICAR 16" in the page numbers.
* The year is 2016, which is inferred from the page numbers.
* The description is a brief summary of the text in simple language.
* The keywords are a list of relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. Let me know if you'd like me to revise anything!
