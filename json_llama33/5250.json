Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "5250",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Surveillance Techniques",
  "description": "The text describes various surveillance techniques, including foot and vehicle surveillance, and how to detect them. It also discusses different methods of surveillance, such as leading and progressive surveillance.",
  "keywords": [
    "surveillance",
    "detection",
    "investigation",
    "security",
    "intelligence"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there is no author mentioned in the input text, I have left the `name` field as `null`. Similarly, since the conference and year are not specified, I have used the default value of `"Not Listed"`. The description is a brief summary of the text in simple language. The keywords are a list of relevant terms excluding the conference and authors.
