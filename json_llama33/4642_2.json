Here is the JSON object:

```
{
  "id": "4642_2",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "List of resources for investigative journalists",
  "description": "This text provides a comprehensive list of online resources and tools for investigative journalists, covering topics such as data analysis, research, and search tools. The list includes links to government databases, business records, and other useful websites.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative journalism",
    "research tools",
    "data analysis",
    "online resources"
  ]
}
```

Note that since there are no authors mentioned in the text, I left the `name` field as `null`. Also, I assumed the conference to be "NICAR" based on the context, but if it's not correct, please let me know. The year is listed as "Not Listed" since it's not clearly identified in the text. The description is a brief summary of the text, and the keywords are a list of relevant terms excluding the conference and authors.
