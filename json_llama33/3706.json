Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "3706",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "This text provides tips and resources for investigative journalists to research and background businesses and individuals. It includes a list of websites and databases that can be used to gather information.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative journalism",
    "research",
    "backgrounding",
    "businesses",
    "individuals"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there is no clear author, title, or conference/year mentioned in the text, I have left those fields as null or "Not Listed". The description is a brief summary of the content, and the keywords are a selection of relevant terms. Let me know if you'd like me to revise anything!
