Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "3533",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Using Data to Tell Stories",
  "description": "The text discusses how to use data to tell stories and provides tips on getting and analyzing data. It also highlights the importance of going beyond the numbers to find the why behind the story.",
  "keywords": [
    "data journalism",
    "investigative reporting",
    "storytelling"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there is no specific author mentioned in the text, I have left the `name` field as `null`. Also, since the conference is not explicitly mentioned as IRE or NICAR, but the content seems more related to NICAR, I have chosen that. If you want me to change it to "Not Listed" or IRE, please let me know.
