Based on the provided text, I will create a JSON object with the specified keys. Here it is:

```
{
  "id": "5815",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text discusses techniques for handling and analyzing data, including using string functions and IF statements. It also touches on the importance of cleaning and formatting data for easier analysis.",
  "keywords": [
    "data analysis",
    "string functions",
    "IF statements",
    "data cleaning"
  ]
}
```

Please note that I had to make some assumptions about the text, as it appears to be a fragment of a larger document. If you provide more context or information, I can refine the JSON object accordingly.
