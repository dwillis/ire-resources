Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "4678",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Data Visualization for Journalists",
  "description": "The text discusses the importance of data visualization in journalism and provides tips on how to create effective visualizations. It also covers the use of color, network graphs, and maps in data visualization.",
  "keywords": [
    "data visualization",
    "journalism",
    "color schemes",
    "network graphs",
    "maps"
  ]
}
```

Note that I've left the author's name as null since none was mentioned in the text. The affiliation is also null, but if a news organization were mentioned, it could be used as the affiliation. The conference is listed as NICAR, which appears to be the most relevant based on the content of the text. The year is not clearly identified, so it's listed as "Not Listed". The description is a brief summary of the text in simple language. The keywords are a list of five terms that exclude the conference and authors.
