Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "Tipsheet_4030_1",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "This tipsheet covers using QGIS for geospatial analysis and mapping, including hexagonal binning and data editing. It provides tutorials and resources for further learning.",
  "keywords": [
    "QGIS",
    "geospatial analysis",
    "mapping",
    "hexagonal binning",
    "data editing"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there was no specific title, author name, email, or affiliation mentioned in the input, I left those fields as null. The conference and year were also not specified, so I listed them as "Not Listed". The description is a brief summary of the text, and the keywords are a list of relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. Let me know if you need any further modifications!
