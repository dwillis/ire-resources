Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "5788",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Star Tribune"
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Boston Globe"
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Dallas Morning News"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text describes several investigative journalism projects, including the Denied Justice project and the Valedictorian Project. These projects involved collecting and analyzing data to tell stories about social issues.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative journalism",
    "data analysis",
    "social issues"
  ]
}
```

However, based on the context of the text, I can try to provide more accurate information:

* The conference is likely "IRE" or "NICAR", but since it's not explicitly stated, I'll keep it as "Not Listed".
* The year is not clearly identified, so I'll keep it as "Not Listed".
* The authors are not explicitly listed, but the text mentions several news organizations. I've used these organizations as affiliations.
* The title is not provided, so I'll leave it as null.
* The description is a brief summary of the text in simple language.
* The keywords are a list of no more than five terms excluding the conference and authors.

If you'd like me to revise anything or provide more information, please let me know!
