Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "4974",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text provides information about various tools and techniques for secure communication, including encrypted chat, email, and phone calls. It also discusses the importance of considering metadata and transparency when choosing security tools.",
  "keywords": [
    "security",
    "encryption",
    "metadata",
    "transparency"
  ]
}
```

Note that I left the `name` field in the `authors` list as `null` since no author name was provided. I also used `Not Listed` for the `conference` and `year` fields since this information was not specified. The `title` field is also `null` since no title was provided. Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help with!
