Here is the JSON object based on the provided text:

```
{
  "id": "3386",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2010",
  "title": "Analyzing Non-Profit Tax Records",
  "description": "This text provides guidance on how to analyze non-profit tax records, specifically Form 990. It discusses what information can be found in these records and how to use it for investigative reporting.",
  "keywords": [
    "non-profit",
    "tax records",
    "Form 990",
    "investigative reporting"
  ]
}
```

Note: I used "IRE" as the conference because the text mentions "Investigative Reporters and Editors" which is likely referring to the IRE conference. Also, since there are no authors mentioned in the text, I left the author's name as null. Let me know if you have any further requests!
