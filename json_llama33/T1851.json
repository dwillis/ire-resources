Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```

  "id": "T1851",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "2002",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The author describes the challenges faced by the media in Sri Lanka, particularly in reporting on the Tiger rebels and the peace process. The government's attempts to silence the media and the risks of not dealing with terrorist threats are highlighted.",
  "keywords": [
    "Sri Lanka",
    "Tiger rebels",
    "media freedom",
    "peace process",
    "terrorism"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there is no clear author name mentioned in the text, I left the "name" field as null. Also, I couldn't find any information about the conference or title, so I marked them as "Not Listed" and null respectively. The year is mentioned as 2002, which seems to be the year of the event. Let me know if you have any further questions!
