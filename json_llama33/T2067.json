Note that I've assumed the conference is NICAR (National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting) based on the context, but if you're sure it's a different conference, please let me know. Also, since there is no clear author name mentioned in the text, I've left the "name" field as null. The affiliation is listed as Sports Illustrated.com, which appears to be the news organization mentioned in the text.
