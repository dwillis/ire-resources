Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "T2381",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "This text describes how to use the PDFtoTEXT program to extract data from PDF files and import it into Excel. The program has some limitations, such as not working with scanned images or encrypted files.",
  "keywords": [
    "PDFtoTEXT",
    "data extraction",
    "Excel"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there is no information about the authors, title, conference, year, I left them as null or "Not Listed". Also, I tried to summarize the text in simple language for the description. Let me know if you need any changes!
