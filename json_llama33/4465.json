Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "4465",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Regulations and Use of Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS)",
  "description": "The use of small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS) is becoming more widespread, but regulations surrounding their use are still being developed. The FAA has issued policies and guidelines, but their authority to enforce these rules is being challenged in court.",
  "keywords": [
    "sUAS",
    "FAA",
    "regulations",
    "drones",
    "aviation"
  ]
}
```

Note that I didn't find any specific author names or affiliations mentioned in the text, so I left those fields as null. Also, since there was no clear indication of the conference or year, I listed them as "Not Listed". Let me know if you need any further modifications!
