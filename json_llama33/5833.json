Here is the JSON object based on the provided text:

```
{
  "id": "5833",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Navigating the new data.census.gov site",
  "description": "The text provides tips and tricks for navigating the new data.census.gov site, including how to find specific tables and understanding the data quality measures. It also highlights some of the challenges and limitations of working with census data.",
  "keywords": [
    "census data",
    "data quality",
    "survey methodology",
    "demographic data",
    "data analysis"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there is no author mentioned in the text, I left the `name` attribute as `null`. Similarly, since there is no clear indication of the year, I set the `year` attribute to `"Not Listed"`. The conference appears to be NICAR, based on the context. Let me know if you have any further questions or if this meets your requirements!
