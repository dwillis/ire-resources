Here is the JSON object based on the provided text:

```
{
  "id": "5811",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "This text is about creating a JSON object based on a given text. It involves extracting relevant information and organizing it into a structured format.",
  "keywords": [
    "JSON",
    "object",
    "text"
  ]
}
```

Note that since there was no specific title, authors, or other details mentioned in the provided text, I have left those fields as null or empty. The description is a brief summary of the task at hand, and the keywords are limited to three relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. Let me know if you need any further modifications!
