Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "4890",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Using Statistics in Journalism",
  "description": "The article discusses the use of statistical tools and methods in journalism, including Excel functions and data analysis. It provides an overview of how to apply statistical techniques to investigative reporting.",
  "keywords": [
    "statistics",
    "journalism",
    "data analysis",
    "Excel"
  ]
}
```

Note that since there are no specific authors mentioned in the text, I have left the `name` field as `null`. Also, since the year of the event is not clearly identified, I have set the `year` field to "Not Listed". The `conference` field is set to "NICAR" based on the context of the text. Let me know if you need any further modifications!
