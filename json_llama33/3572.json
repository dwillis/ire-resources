  "title": "Investigative Journalism Projects",
  "description": "The text describes various investigative journalism projects from different news organizations, highlighting their findings on topics such as crime statistics, environmental issues, and government accountability. The projects used data analysis and other investigative techniques to uncover important information.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative journalism",
    "data analysis",
    "crime statistics",
    "environmental issues",
    "government accountability"
  ]
}
```

Note that since the text does not mention specific authors, I left the `name` field as `null`. Also, I used the news organization names as affiliations. The conference and year are listed as "Not Listed" since they are not clearly identified in the text.
