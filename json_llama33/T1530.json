Here is the JSON object:

  "id": "T1530",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "People Finding and Backgrounding Tipsheet",
  "description": "This text provides tips and resources for finding people and background information. It includes links to various websites and databases that can be used for research.",
  "keywords": [
    "people finding",
    "backgrounding",
    "research",
    "investigative journalism"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there is no author mentioned in the text, I left the name as null. Also, since the year of the event is not clearly identified, I put "Not Listed" as the value for year. Let me know if you have any further questions!
