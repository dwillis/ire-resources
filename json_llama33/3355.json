Here is the JSON object:

```
{
  "id": "3355",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Various news organizations"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigative reporting projects",
  "description": "A collection of investigative reporting projects from various news organizations, including USA Today, The New York Times, and KING-5 TV. These projects cover a range of topics, from government spending to environmental pollution.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative reporting",
    "data journalism",
    "government accountability",
    "environmental pollution",
    "corporate transparency"
  ]
}
```

Note that I've used "Various news organizations" as the affiliation since there are multiple authors from different organizations mentioned in the text, but no specific author names are listed. I've also kept the description brief and focused on summarizing the main theme of the text. Let me know if you'd like me to make any changes!
