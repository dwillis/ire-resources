Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "4605",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Journalism Tips and Best Practices",
  "description": "The text provides tips and best practices for journalists to ensure accuracy and fairness in their reporting. It covers various aspects of journalism, including data analysis and fact-checking.",
  "keywords": [
    "journalism",
    "accuracy",
    "fact-checking",
    "data analysis"
  ]
}
```

Note that I had to make some assumptions since there was no clear information about the authors, conference, or year. Also, I summarized the description in simple language based on the content of the text. Let me know if you need any further changes!
