Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "3825",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigative Reporting Resources",
  "description": "The text provides a list of resources and databases for investigative reporting, including information on plane crashes, car accidents, and workplace safety. It also lists various national and local databases that can be used for research.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative reporting",
    "databases",
    "resources",
    "research",
    "journalism"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there are no specific authors mentioned in the text, I have left the `name` attribute as `null`. The `affiliation` is also `null` since there is no news organization or affiliation mentioned. The `conference` is listed as "NICAR" since the text mentions NICAR database library and seems to be related to investigative reporting. The `year` is "Not Listed" since the year of the event is not clearly identified in the text.
