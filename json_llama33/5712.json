  "description": "This text provides guidance and tips for journalists reporting on the child welfare system, including how to interview foster youth and current and former foster children.

  "keywords": [
    "child welfare",
    "foster care",
    "journalism",
    "reporting",
    "trauma"

}
```

Note: Since there is no clear author name, email, or affiliation mentioned in the text, I left those fields as null. Also, since the conference and year are not specified, I used "Not Listed" for those fields. The description is a brief summary of the text, and the keywords are a selection of relevant terms that exclude the conference and authors.
