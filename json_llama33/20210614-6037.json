Here is the JSON object based on the provided text:

```
{
  "id": "6037",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Various news organizations"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Local Investigations and Reporting",
  "description": "The text highlights various local investigations and reporting projects from different news organizations, showcasing their work and impact. It also provides resources for tracking local investigations and getting involved in the community.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative journalism",
    "local news",
    "reporting",
    "accountability",
    "transparency"
  ]
}
```

Note that I've used "Various news organizations" as the affiliation since there are multiple news organizations mentioned in the text, but no specific author names. Also, I've kept the description brief and focused on the main theme of the text. Let me know if you'd like me to make any changes!
