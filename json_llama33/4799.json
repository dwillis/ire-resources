}
```

Note: Since there are no specific authors mentioned in the text, I have left the "name" field as null. If you'd like to add any authors, please let me know and I can update the JSON object accordingly.

Also, I've assumed the conference to be "NICAR" since it's mentioned multiple times in the text, but if you're sure it's a different conference, please let me know and I'll update it.

The description is a brief summary of the text, and I've excluded the conference and authors from the keywords list as per your request. Let me know if you need any further changes!
