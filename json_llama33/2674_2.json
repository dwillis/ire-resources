Note that I've made the following assumptions:

* Since there are no specific author names mentioned, I've left the `name` field as `null`.
* The affiliation is based on the news organizations mentioned in the text (Los Angeles Times and Associated Press).
* The conference is "Not Listed" since it's not specified in the text.
* The year is 1992, which is the year the L.A. riots occurred.
* The description is a brief summary of the text in simple language.
* The keywords are limited to five terms and exclude the conference and authors.
