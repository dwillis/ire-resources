}
```

Note: Since there are no authors mentioned in the text, I have left the name as null. Also, since the year of the event is not clearly identified, I have marked it as "Not Listed". The conference is assumed to be "IRE" based on the context of the text. The description is a 2-sentence summary of the text in simple language, and the keywords are a list of no more than five terms excluding the conference and authors.
