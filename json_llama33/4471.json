Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "4471",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Research Tools and Resources for Investigative Journalists",
  "description": "This is a list of research tools and resources that can be used by investigative journalists to find information and data. The list includes websites, databases, and other online resources.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative journalism",
    "research tools",
    "data journalism"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there are no specific authors mentioned in the text, I left the `name` attribute as `null`. Also, since the year of the event is not clearly identified, I set the `year` attribute to `"Not Listed"`. The `conference` attribute is set to `"IRE"` based on the context, but it could also be `"NICAR"` or `"Not Listed"` depending on the actual conference. Let me know if you need any further adjustments!
