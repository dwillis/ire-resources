Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "4650",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "IRE"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Understanding the College Scorecard Data",
  "description": "The College Scorecard is a dataset that provides information on college outcomes, including debt, earnings, and graduation rates. This text provides guidance on how to use and interpret the data.",
  "keywords": [
    "College Scorecard",
    "education data",
    "student debt",
    "earnings"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there are no specific authors mentioned in the input, I have left the name as null. Also, since the conference is not explicitly mentioned, I have listed it as "Not Listed". Similarly, the year of the event is not clearly identified, so I have listed it as "Not Listed" as well. The keywords are a selection of relevant terms from the input text.
