  "keywords": [
    "investigation",
    "breaking news",
    "research tools",
    "social media",

  ]
}
```

Note: Since there is no specific author mentioned in the text, I have left the name as null. Also, the conference and year are not clearly identified, so I have listed them as "Not Listed". The description is a brief summary of the text, and the keywords are a list of relevant terms excluding the conference and authors.
