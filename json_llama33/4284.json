Here is the JSON object based on the provided text:

```
{
  "id": "4284",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Talking to friendly computers",
  "description": "This text discusses various command-line tools and techniques for working with computers, including wget, ssh, scp, and screen. It also touches on the importance of using open source software.",
  "keywords": [
    "command-line tools",
    "remote computing",
    "open source"
  ]
}
```

Note that I had to make some assumptions about the text, as there was not much information provided about the authors or the year of the event. If more context were available, I could provide a more accurate JSON object. Let me know if you have any further requests!
