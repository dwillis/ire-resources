Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "4564",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text describes a list of tools for journalists, including Nuzzel, SnagIt, Storify, and others. These tools can be used for social media curation, screen capture, and data analysis.",
  "keywords": [
    "journalism",
    "social media",
    "data analysis",
    "screen capture",
    "curation"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there is no clear author or title mentioned in the text, I have left those fields as null. The conference and year are also not listed, so I have used the default value of "Not Listed". The description is a brief summary of the text, and the keywords are a list of relevant terms excluding the conference and authors.
