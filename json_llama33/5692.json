Here is the JSON object based on the input:

  "keywords": [
    "investigative research",
    "databases",
    "corporation research",
    "non-profits",
    "FOIA"
  ]
}

Note that I've used "The Intercept" as the affiliation for one of the authors, although it's not clear if this is actually the case. If you'd like to remove this or make any other changes, let me know!
