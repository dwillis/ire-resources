Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "5185_1",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigative Reporting using FOIA",
  "description": "The text discusses how to use the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to obtain information for investigative reporting. It provides resources and tips for navigating the FOIA process.",
  "keywords": [
    "FOIA",
    "investigative reporting",
    "government transparency"
  ]
}
```

Note that I've left the author's name as `null` since no specific author is mentioned in the text. If you'd like to add an affiliation based on a news organization, please let me know and I can update the JSON object accordingly. Also, I've used "IRE" as the conference since the text mentions "Investigations Editor Jeff Leen" which suggests a connection to the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) organization. If this is incorrect, please let me know and I can update the JSON object.
