Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "3226",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "This text is about creating a DL file for network analysis and importing it into UCINET. It provides step-by-step instructions on how to create a DL file from data in Microsoft Access or other databases.",
  "keywords": [
    "UCINET",
    "DL file",
    "network analysis"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there was no specific information about the authors, title, and some other fields, I left them as null. If you provide more context or details, I can update the JSON object accordingly.
