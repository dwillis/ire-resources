Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "5602_2",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigative Story Ideas",
  "description": "This text provides a list of investigative story ideas, including topics such as government contracts, data breaches, and nursing home abuse. The list appears to be intended for journalists or researchers looking for potential story leads.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative reporting",
    "story ideas",
    "government contracts",
    "data breaches",
    "nursing homes"
  ]
}
```

Note that I've left the author information blank since there is no specific author mentioned in the text. I've also used "Not Listed" for the year since it's not clear when the event or publication occurred. The conference is listed as "IRE" since the text mentions "https://www.khou.com/article/news/investigations/" which suggests a connection to the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) organization. Let me know if you have any further requests!
