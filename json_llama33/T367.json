Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "T367",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigating Financial Statements",
  "description": "This text provides guidance on how to investigate financial statements and identify potential red flags. It includes examples of 'legal' and 'illegal' book cooking methods.",
  "keywords": [
    "financial statements",
    "book cooking",
    "investigation"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there is no clear author name, email or affiliation mentioned in the text, I have left these fields as null. Also, the conference and year are not explicitly mentioned, so I have listed them as "Not Listed". The description is a brief summary of the text, and the keywords are a selection of relevant terms from the text.
