Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "4656",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "This text is about web scraping tools and techniques, including Google Sheets, OutWit Hub, import.io, and other desktop apps and browser extensions.",
  "keywords": [
    "web scraping",
    "data journalism",
    "tools"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there was no specific information provided about the authors, title, or conference, I left those fields with null or default values. The description is a brief summary of the text in simple language, and the keywords are a list of relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. Let me know if you need any further modifications!
