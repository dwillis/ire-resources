Here is the JSON object based on the provided text:

```
{
  "id": "4684_2",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text describes a tutorial on splitting apart data in Excel, including city and state, and authors' names. It also discusses using the LEN function to determine the length of a cell's contents.",
  "keywords": [
    "Excel",
    "data splitting",
    "LEN function"
  ]
}
```

Note that I've left the `name`, `email`, and `affiliation` fields as `null` since there is no information provided about the authors. Similarly, I've left the `title` field as `null` since there is no title mentioned in the text. The `conference` and `year` fields are set to "Not Listed" since this information is not provided. The `description` field provides a brief summary of the text, and the `keywords` field lists three relevant terms. Let me know if you'd like me to revise anything!
