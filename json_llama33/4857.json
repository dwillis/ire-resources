Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "4857",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "SQL Tutorial for Data Analysis",
  "description": "This tutorial provides an introduction to SQL, a language used for managing and analyzing data. It covers basic concepts such as selecting, filtering, and grouping data.",
  "keywords": [
    "SQL",
    "data analysis",
    "databases"
  ]
}
```

Note that I had to make some assumptions about the input since there was no specific information provided about the authors, conference, or year. If you have any further clarification or details, I'd be happy to update the JSON object accordingly!
