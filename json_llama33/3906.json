Here is the JSON object:

```
{
  "id": "3906",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigative Reporting Examples",
  "description": "The text describes various investigative reporting projects from different news organizations, including topics such as government accountability, education, and crime. The reports highlight issues like corruption, neglect, and abuse of power.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative reporting",
    "government accountability",
    "education",
    "crime"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there are no specific authors mentioned in the text, I left the `name` attribute as `null`. If you want to include the news organizations as affiliations, I can modify the JSON object accordingly. Let me know!
