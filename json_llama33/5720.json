Here is the JSON object:

```
{
  "id": "5720",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigating School Choice and Charter Schools",
  "description": "This text provides resources and tips for investigating school choice and charter schools, including information on private school vouchers and online charters. It also includes links to relevant news articles and research studies.",
  "keywords": [
    "school choice",
    "charter schools",
    "private school vouchers",
    "online charters",
    "education"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there is no specific author mentioned in the text, I left the `name` field as `null`. Also, I chose `IRE` as the conference since the text appears to be related to investigative reporting and education, which are common topics at IRE conferences. If you have any further information about the context of this text, I may be able to provide a more accurate JSON object.
