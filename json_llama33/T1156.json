Here is the JSON object created from the input:

```
{
  "id": "T1156",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text discusses juvenile justice, including statistics, trends, and expert opinions. It also provides a list of organizations and individuals who can be contacted for more information.",
  "keywords": [
    "juvenile justice",
    "crime statistics",
    "youth violence"
  ]
}
```

Note that I left the `name` field in the `authors` object as `null`, since there were no specific author names mentioned in the text. Similarly, I left the `title` field as `null`, since there was no clear title provided. The `conference` and `year` fields are also set to "Not Listed", since this information was not explicitly stated in the text. Let me know if you'd like me to revise anything!
