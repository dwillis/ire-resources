Here is the JSON object:

```
{
  "id": "4185",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "This text provides guidance on how to make records requests and lists various databases and resources for investigative reporting. It includes examples of databases related to environmental, financial, and lobbying issues.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative reporting",
    "records requests",
    "databases",
    "environmental issues",
    "lobbying"
  ]
}
```

Note: I left the title null as there was no clear title in the provided text. Also, since there were no authors mentioned, I kept the authors list with a single element having all attributes as null. If you need any changes or have further questions, feel free to ask!
