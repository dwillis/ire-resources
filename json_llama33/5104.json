Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "5104",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": "@tamaramunzner",
      "affiliation": null
    },
    {
      "name": "Johanna Bickel",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text discusses two tools, Timeline and Overview, used for data journalism. Timeline is used to create interactive timelines, while Overview is used to analyze large document collections.",
  "keywords": [
    "data journalism",
    "Timeline",
    "Overview",
    "document analysis",
    "investigative reporting"
  ]
}
```

However, the name of at least one author is mentioned: Tamara Munzner. I will update the authors list accordingly:

```
