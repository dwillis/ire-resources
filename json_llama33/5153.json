Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "5153",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Various news organizations (e.g. USA TODAY, New York Times, Chicago Tribune)"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigative Reporting Projects",
  "description": "A collection of investigative reporting projects from various news organizations, covering topics such as police shootings, property tax systems, and climate change. The projects use data analysis and other techniques to uncover insights and tell stories.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative reporting",
    "data journalism",
    "police shootings",
    "property tax",
    "climate change"
  ]
}
```

Note that I've used "NICAR" as the conference, assuming it refers to the National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting, which is a common conference for investigative journalists. If this is incorrect, please let me know and I can update the JSON object accordingly. Also, since there are no specific authors mentioned in the text, I've left the author name as null and used a general affiliation that encompasses the various news organizations mentioned.
