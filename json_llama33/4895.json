Here is the JSON object based on the provided specifications:

```

      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "This text does not provide a description. It appears to be a tutorial on SQL.",
  "keywords": [

Please note that I had to make some assumptions since there was no actual text provided to extract information from. If you can provide the actual text, I'll be happy to help create a more accurate JSON object.
