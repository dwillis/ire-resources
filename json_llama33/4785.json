Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "4785",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Canadian Arms Sales Visualization",
  "description": "This is a tutorial on how to create a visualization of Canadian arms sales using Tableau. The tutorial covers how to import data, create maps and tables, and publish the visualization online.",
  "keywords": [
    "Tableau",
    "Data Visualization",
    "Canadian Arms Sales"
  ]
}
```

Note that since there is no author information provided in the input, I left the `name`, `email`, and `affiliation` fields as `null`. Also, since the conference and year are not clearly identified, I listed them as "Not Listed". The description is a brief summary of the text, and the keywords are a list of relevant terms excluding the conference and authors.
