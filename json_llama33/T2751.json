Note that I did not include the author "Mr. Moulton" as their first name is not mentioned in the text, and I used the news organization or entity as the affiliation if no specific affiliation was listed next to the author's name. Also, I limited the keywords to five terms as per your request. Let me know if you need any further changes!
