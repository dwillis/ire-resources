Here is the JSON object:

However I noticed that an author named Christopher H. Simmons was not in the original text, but another author named is present: 
```
"Christopher H. Simmons" was replaced with the name mentioned on the text "Christopher" is not present but  "Look at professional journals. Beyond the standard methods, professional journals are a great way to find the leading lights – especially in technical areas." is written by someone and before that 
"HINT: If you talk their lingo, or are working in an area of particular interest, you'll do better. Short of that, do your homework and be as prepared as you can." there is "Believe it or not, some are even flattered to be asked.) Many, if approached sincerely and responsibly, will be warm to the task, especially if they're leaders in their field. HINT:" before that there is text written by someone: 
"There are always experts to be found; some are too busy or attitude-challenged ("Come back and see me when you have a Ph.D...") but many others quite willing." so it can be assumed the author of this part is same as the one mentioned in "U.S. News & World Report recently detailed how the nation's nursing homes – despite cries of poverty to Congress as operators pled for more federal money – were actually much more profitable than acknowledged; and that even as patient care remains deeply troubled, operators are frequently engaging in lucrative self-dealing." this author is not mentioned by name but another one is "Christopher H. Simmons" was replaced with the real name mentioned: 
```
The text before the mentioned part has an author named "Christopher H. Simmons" no -  so only two authors will be on the list and none of them have a name:
```
