Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "3935",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Descriptive Statistics in Excel",
  "description": "The text describes how to use Excel to calculate descriptive statistics, such as mean and standard deviation. It also explains how to use the Data Analysis tool to get a summary of statistics for a dataset.",
  "keywords": [
    "descriptive statistics",
    "Excel",
    "Data Analysis"
  ]
}
```

Note that since there are no authors mentioned in the text, I have left the name as null. Also, since the conference is not explicitly mentioned as IRE or NICAR, but the text mentions "NICAR" in the context of a presentation, I have assumed it to be NICAR. If this is incorrect, please let me know and I will change it accordingly.
