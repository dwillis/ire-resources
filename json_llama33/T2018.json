Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "T2018",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Wendell Cochran",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "American University"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2004",
  "title": "Downloading and analyzing FEC data",
  "description": "This text provides information on how to download and analyze Federal Election Commission (FEC) data. It lists various websites and resources that offer downloadable data files and search capabilities.",
  "keywords": [
    "FEC data",
    "campaign finance",
    "elections"
  ]
}
```

Note: I extracted the year from the text as 2004, which is mentioned in one of the paragraphs. If this is not accurate, please let me know and I can change it to "Not Listed". Also, I only included Wendell Cochran as the author since he is the only one explicitly mentioned as the creator of a website. If there are other authors that should be included, please provide more information.
