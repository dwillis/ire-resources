Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "6036",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Structuring Your Story",
  "description": "This text discusses a step-by-step process for structuring and writing enterprise stories, including creating an outline and chunking out the story. The goal is to make the writing process smoother and easier to edit.",
  "keywords": [
    "story structure",
    "writing process",
    "outlining",
    "editing"
  ]
}
```

Note that I didn't include any author information since none was provided in the text. I also assumed the conference to be NICAR based on the style and content of the text, but this could be incorrect if the text is from a different conference. Let me know if you need further changes!
