  "keywords": [
    "nonprofit financials",
    "990 forms",

}
```

Note that I've assumed the conference is "IRE" based on the mention of "IRE tipsheets" in the text, but if this is incorrect, please let me know and I can update it accordingly. Also, since there are no specific authors mentioned in the text, I've left the author information as null. If you'd like to add any other information or make changes, just let me know!
