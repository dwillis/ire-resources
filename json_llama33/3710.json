Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "3710",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "news organization"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigating Construction Waste and Corruption",
  "description": "This text describes an investigation into construction waste and corruption in a college district's building program. The investigation used documents, emails, and confidential sources to uncover problems and wrongdoing.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative journalism",
    "construction waste",
    "corruption",
    "document analysis",
    "email investigation"
  ]
}
```

Note: I assumed the conference is NICAR (National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting) since the text mentions "NICAR" in the context of investigative journalism. If this is incorrect, please let me know and I'll update the JSON object accordingly. Also, I used a generic affiliation "news organization" as it's not clear which specific news organization is being referred to.
