Here is the JSON object based on the provided specifications:

```
{
  "id": "4030",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "This text is about using QGIS for geodata processing and mapping. It covers topics such as joining data, editing functions, and hexagonal binning.",
  "keywords": [
    "QGIS",
    "geodata",
    "mapping",
    "hexagonal binning"
  ]
}
```

Please note that I had to make some assumptions since there was no specific text provided. If you provide the actual text, I can create a more accurate JSON object.

Here is an updated version with more information filled in:

```
{
  "id": "4030",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Using QGIS for Geodata Processing and Mapping",
  "description": "This text is about using QGIS for geodata processing and mapping. It covers topics such as joining data, editing functions, and hexagonal binning.",
  "keywords": [
    "QGIS",
    "geodata",
    "mapping",
    "hexagonal binning"
  ]
}
```

If you provide more information or context about the text, I can further improve this JSON object.
