Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "4261",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "FOIA Guide",
  "description": "This text provides a guide on how to navigate the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) process, including tips and resources for filing and tracking requests. It also covers the law and regulations surrounding FOIA.",
  "keywords": [
    "FOIA",
    "Freedom of Information Act",
    "open records",
    "government transparency"
  ]
}
```

Note that I didn't include any authors since none were mentioned in the text. Also, I couldn't determine the conference or year, so I listed them as "Not Listed". Let me know if you have any further questions! 

However, after re-reading the prompt and the original text, it appears that the text might be related to the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) organization. If that's correct, here is an updated version of the JSON object:

```
{
  "id": "4261",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE)"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "FOIA Guide",
  "description": "This text provides a guide on how to navigate the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) process, including tips and resources for filing and tracking requests. It also covers the law and regulations surrounding FOIA.",
  "keywords": [
    "FOIA",
    "Freedom of Information Act",
    "open records",
    "government transparency"
  ]
}
```
