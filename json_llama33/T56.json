Here is the JSON object:

  "title": "Investigative Research Resources",
  "description": "This text provides a list of resources for investigative research, including government agencies, public records, and other sources of information. It appears to be a guide for researchers or journalists.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative research",
    "public records",
    "government agencies"
  ]
}
```

Note that I've left the author information blank since there is no mention of an author in the text. I've also listed the conference as "Not Listed" since it's not clear which conference this text is associated with. The year is also "Not Listed" since there is no specific year mentioned in the text. Let me know if you have any further requests!
