Note that I've left the `name` field in the `authors` list as `null`, since there is no author mentioned in the text. Similarly, I've left the `title` field as `null`, since there is no clear title provided in the text. The `conference` and `year` fields are also set to "Not Listed", since this information is not present in the text.
