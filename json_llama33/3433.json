}
```

Note that I've left the author names as null since they are not explicitly mentioned in the text. I've also used the email addresses provided in the text as the authors' emails. The conference is listed as "Not Listed" since it is not clearly identified in the text. The year is listed as 2010 based on the date mentioned in the text (7/13/2010). The description is a brief summary of the text, and the keywords are a list of relevant terms excluding the conference and authors.
