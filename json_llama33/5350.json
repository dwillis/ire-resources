Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "5350",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "IRE"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Opioid Data Resources",
  "description": "The text provides a list of resources and data related to the opioid crisis, including links to various state and local government websites. It appears to be a collection of information for journalists or researchers.",
  "keywords": [
    "opioid crisis",
    "data resources",
    "government websites"
  ]
}
```

Note that I've left the author's name as null since none is listed, and used "IRE" as the affiliation based on the context. I've also set the conference to "Not Listed" since it's not explicitly mentioned in the text. The year is also "Not Listed" for the same reason. The description is a brief summary of the text, and the keywords are a list of relevant terms excluding the conference and authors.
