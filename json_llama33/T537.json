  "keywords": [
    "tankers",
    "barges",
    "oil spills",
    "safety standards",
    "regulations"

}
```

Note: Since there is no clear author mentioned in the text, I have left the `name` attribute as `null`. Similarly, since there is no clear conference or year mentioned, I have listed them as "Not Listed". The description is a brief summary of the text, and the keywords are a list of relevant terms.
