Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "3852",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "American FactFinder Enhancements",
  "description": "The American FactFinder has been enhanced with new features, including a redesigned main page and improved search functionality. The enhancements aim to make it easier for users to find and access data.",
  "keywords": [
    "American FactFinder",
    "data access",
    "search functionality"
  ]
}
```

Note that since there is no specific author mentioned in the text, I left the `name` field as `null`. Also, since the conference and year are not clearly identified, I listed them as "Not Listed". Let me know if you'd like me to revise anything!
