It appears that you want me to create a JSON object based on some input text. However, I don't see any input text provided. Please provide the text, and I'll do my best to create the JSON object according to your specifications.

If you're ready, please go ahead and provide the text, and I'll get started! 

(Also, just to confirm, the JSON object should have the following keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. And the id should be 4058, correct?)
