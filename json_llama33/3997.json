Here is the JSON object based on the provided specifications:

```
{
  "id": "3997",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "This text does not provide any information about a conference, authors, or keywords. It appears to be a set of instructions for creating a JSON object.",
  "keywords": []
}
```

Please note that since there is no actual text provided about a conference, authors, or keywords, I had to leave most fields empty or with default values. If you provide the actual text, I can help create a more accurate JSON object.
