Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "2893",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigating Prison Health and Safety",
  "description": "The text discusses the importance of investigating prison health and safety, highlighting issues such as poor medical care and violent incidents. It provides resources and contacts for journalists to explore these topics further.",
  "keywords": [
    "prison health",
    "prison safety",
    "investigative journalism"
  ]
}
```

Note that I didn't find any specific author names or affiliations in the text, so I left those fields as null. The conference and year are also not explicitly mentioned, so I used "Not Listed" for those fields. Let me know if you have any further questions!
