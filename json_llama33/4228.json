Here is the JSON object based on the provided text:

```
{
  "id": "4228",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Government Contracting and Small Business Contractors",
  "description": "The text discusses government contracting, including sole sourcing and non-competitive contracts, as well as resources for finding small business contractors. It provides information on how to search for contractors in certain states or industry areas.",
  "keywords": [
    "government contracting",
    "small business contractors",
    "non-competitive contracts",
    "sole sourcing"
  ]
}
```

Note that since there are no authors mentioned in the text, I left the `name` field as `null`. Similarly, since the conference and year are not specified, I used "Not Listed" for those fields. The description is a brief summary of the text, and the keywords are a selection of relevant terms from the text.
