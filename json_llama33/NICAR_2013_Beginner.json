Here is the JSON object based on the input:

  ]
}
```

Note: I assumed the year to be 2013 based on the input, but if it's not clearly mentioned, you can change it to "Not Listed". Also, I used "Tableau Software" as the affiliation for all authors since it was mentioned in the email addresses. If you want to leave the name as null, you can do so. Let me know if you need any further changes!
