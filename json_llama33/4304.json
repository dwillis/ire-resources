Note that since there are no specific authors mentioned in the text, I have left the `name` field as `null`. Also, the `year` is listed as "Not Listed" since it's not clearly identified in the text. The `conference` is assumed to be NICAR based on the content of the text, but it could also be IRE or Not Listed if more context was provided.
