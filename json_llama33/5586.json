Here is the JSON object:

```
{
  "id": "5586",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Texas Public Information Act",
  "description": "The Texas Public Information Act provides guidelines for requesting and obtaining public information in Texas. The act outlines the procedures for making requests, the costs associated with obtaining information, and the consequences for noncompliance.",
  "keywords": [
    "Texas Public Information Act",
    "FOIA",
    "public records",
    "transparency",
    "government"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there are no specific authors mentioned in the text, I left the `name` attribute as `null`. Also, since the conference and year are not clearly identified, I listed them as "Not Listed". The description is a brief summary of the text, and the keywords are relevant terms related to the topic. Let me know if you'd like me to make any changes!
