  "title": "When good design goes bad: your power as a designer",
  "description": "The presentation discusses how designers can use their skills to manipulate data and create misleading visualizations, and highlights the importance of ethical design practices. It also provides examples of how designers can use proximity, hiding inconvenient data, and manipulating data to back up a narrative.",
  "keywords": [
    "data visualization",
    "design ethics",
    "manipulation"
  ]
}
```

Note that I've left the author names as null since none were explicitly mentioned in the text. I've also used the news organizations mentioned in the text as affiliations for the authors. The conference and year are listed as "Not Listed" since they were not clearly identified in the text. The description is a brief summary of the presentation, and the keywords are a list of relevant terms excluding the conference and authors.
