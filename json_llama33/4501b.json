Here is the JSON object based on the provided input:

```
{
  "id": "4501b",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigative Reporting Tips and Story Ideas",
  "description": "This text provides tips and story ideas for investigative reporting, including suggestions for researching and investigating various topics. It appears to be a collection of notes from a conference or workshop.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative reporting",
    "story ideas",
    "research techniques"
  ]
}
```

Note that I was unable to identify any specific authors, conference, or year from the text, so those fields are left as null or "Not Listed". The description is a brief summary of the content in simple language. The keywords are limited to three terms and do not include the conference or authors, as per your request. Let me know if you'd like me to make any changes!
