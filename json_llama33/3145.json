Here is the JSON object based on the provided text:

```
{
  "id": "3145",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Scraping data from NICAR website",
  "description": "The text describes how to scrape data from the NICAR website using Perl scripts. It provides examples of code and explains how to extract information from the website.",
  "keywords": [
    "web scraping",
    "Perl",
    "data extraction"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there are no authors mentioned in the text, I left the name as null. Also, I assumed that the conference is NICAR based on the mentions of "NICAR" throughout the text. The year is not listed as it's not clearly identified in the text. The description is a brief summary of the text, and the keywords are relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. Let me know if you need any further changes!
