Here is the JSON object based on the provided text:

  "authors": [

      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Computer-Assisted Reporting Guide",
  "description": "This guide provides a step-by-step approach to conducting computer-assisted reporting, including data analysis and storytelling. It covers the process from idea generation to publication.",
  "keywords": [
    "computer-assisted reporting",
    "data analysis",
    "storytelling",
    "journalism"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there are no specific authors mentioned in the text, I left the author name as null. Also, since the conference and year are not explicitly mentioned, I used "Not Listed" for those fields. The description is a brief summary of the text in simple language, and the keywords are a list of relevant terms excluding the conference and authors.
