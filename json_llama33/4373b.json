Here is the JSON object based on the provided input:

      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "1936-1937",
  "title": "Execution Records",
  "description": "The text appears to be a list of execution records from the state of Georgia, including the names of those executed, their race, age, and crime. The list spans several years, from 1936 to 1937.",
  "keywords": [
    "executions",
    "Georgia",
    "capital punishment",
    "crime"
  ]
}
```

Note that since there are no authors mentioned in the text, I left the `name` field as `null`. Also, the conference is not explicitly mentioned, so I listed it as "Not Listed". The year range is approximate, but based on the dates mentioned in the text. Let me know if you have any further requests!
