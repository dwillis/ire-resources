Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "5224",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "This text is about using SQL to filter and format data. It covers basic SQL commands such as SELECT, FROM, WHERE, and LIKE.",
  "keywords": [
    "SQL",
    "data filtering",
    "data formatting"
  ]
}
```

Note that I had to make some assumptions since the input did not provide specific information about the authors, title, or conference. If you provide more context or clarify what you would like me to extract from the text, I can try to create a more accurate JSON object.
