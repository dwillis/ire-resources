  "keywords": [
    "company research",
    "financial records",
    "public records",
    "investigative journalism"
  ]
}
```

Note: I assumed the conference is NICAR (National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting) based on the content of the text, but it could also be IRE (Investigative Reporters and Editors). If you have more information about the context, please let me know. Also, since there are no authors mentioned in the text, I left the authors list with a single element with null values.
