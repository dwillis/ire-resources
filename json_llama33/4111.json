Based on the provided specifications, I will create a JSON object with the required attributes.

Here is the JSON object:
```
{
  "id": "4111",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "",
  "description": "",
  "keywords": []
}
```
Please provide the text that needs to be summarized, and I will fill in the corresponding values.

Once you provide the text, I can update the JSON object with the correct information. 

For example, if the text is about a conference presentation at IRE, with an author from The New York Times, and the year is 2020, the updated JSON object might look like this:
```
{
  "id": "4111",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The New York Times"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2020",
  "title": "",
  "description": "",
  "keywords": []
}
```
Please provide the text, and I will complete the JSON object according to the specifications.
