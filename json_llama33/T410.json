Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "T410",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigating Financial Discrimination",
  "description": "This text provides tips and resources for investigating financial discrimination, including redlining in banking and insurance. It lists various experts, organizations, and data sources that can help with such investigations.",
  "keywords": [
    "financial discrimination",
    "redlining",
    "banking",
    "insurance",
    "investigative reporting"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since there is no clear author mentioned in the text, I left the `name` attribute as `null`. Also, the year of the event is not clearly identified, so I set the `year` attribute to `"Not Listed"`. The conference is assumed to be NICAR based on the context, but it's not explicitly stated. If you have more information about the context, please let me know and I can update the JSON object accordingly.
