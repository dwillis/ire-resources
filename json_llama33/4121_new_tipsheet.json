}
```

Note that I've made the following assumptions:

* The author's name is not listed, so it's set to `null`.
* The affiliation is assumed to be "MaryJo Webster" since it's mentioned in the text as the creator of the Excel tips and tricks guide.
* The conference is set to "Not Listed" since it's not clearly identified in the text.
* The year is set to "Not Listed" since it's not clearly identified in the text.
* The description is a brief summary of the text in simple language.
* The keywords are a list of relevant terms excluding the conference and authors, limited to five terms.
