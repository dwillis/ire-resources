Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```

  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Bernard Pine",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Orange County Register"
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "2004",
  "title": "How the hospital report card was made",
  "description": "The Orange County Register created a hospital report card by analyzing patient discharge records and other data. The report card ranks hospitals based on seven measures, including risk-adjusted mortality rates.",
  "keywords": [
    "hospital rankings",
    "patient safety",
    "healthcare quality"
  ]
}
```

Note: I used "The Orange County Register" as the affiliation for Bernard Pine since it is mentioned in the text as a news organization. However, upon closer inspection of the original text, I realize that "Bernard Pine" might not be an author but rather part of a consulting firm ("Michael Pine and Associates") mentioned in the article, which analyzed data for The Orange County Register. Given this ambiguity and the lack of clear information about authors, a more accurate representation would be:

```
{
  "id": "T2354",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Orange County Register"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "2004",
  "title": "How the hospital report card was made",
  "description": "The Orange County Register created a hospital report card by analyzing patient discharge records and other data. The report card ranks hospitals based on seven measures, including risk-adjusted mortality rates.",
  "keywords": [
    "hospital rankings",
    "patient safety",
    "healthcare quality"
  ]
}
```

This revised version reflects that there are no explicitly named authors in the provided text, and it attributes the affiliation to The Orange County Register as the source of the report.
