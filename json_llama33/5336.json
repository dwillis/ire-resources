Based on the provided text, I will create a JSON object with the requested information.

```json
{
  "id": "5336",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "This text does not provide enough information to create a summary. The original text appears to be about working with open-source software and using command-line tools like apt-get and pip.",
  "keywords": [
    "open-source software",
    "command-line tools",
    "apt-get",
    "pip"
  ]
}
```

Please note that I had to leave some fields as `null` because the provided text does not contain enough information to fill them in. Also, since there is no clear title or author mentioned, I couldn't provide a more detailed description or populate those fields. If you have any further questions or need additional clarification, feel free to ask!
