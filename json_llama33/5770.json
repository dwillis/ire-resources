Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "5770",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "This text provides tips and resources for searching online, including Google dorking, Facebook and Twitter search operators, and privacy settings. It also includes information on data breaches and internet archives.",
  "keywords": [
    "online search",
    "privacy settings",
    "data breaches",
    "internet archives",
    "social media"
  ]
}
```

Note that I had to make some assumptions since there was no specific title, author, or conference mentioned in the input. If you provide more context or clarify what you would like me to extract from the text, I can try to create a more accurate JSON object.
