Here is the JSON object based on your input:

```
{
  "id": "4690_1",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "",
  "description": "",
  "keywords": []
}
```

Since there is no text provided, I couldn't fill in any of the fields. If you provide the text, I can help create a more complete JSON object.

Please provide the text, and I'll do my best to:

* Identify authors and their affiliations (if available)
* Determine the conference (IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed)
* Extract the year (or use "Not Listed" if not available)
* Create a brief description of the text
* Select relevant keywords (up to 5)

I'll update the JSON object accordingly.
