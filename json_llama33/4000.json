Here is the JSON object:

```
{
  "id": "4000",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "This text does not provide enough information to create a summary.",
  "keywords": []
}
```

Please note that I had to make some assumptions since the input text was not provided. If you provide the actual text, I can fill in the values accordingly. 

Also, please let me know if there are any specific requirements or rules for extracting the information from the text, such as handling multiple authors or conferences. 

Here's an example of how the JSON object might look with more information:

```
{

      "email": "john.doe@example.com",

    },
    {
      "name": "Jane Smith",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "BBC News"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2022",
  "title": "Investigative Reporting Conference",
  "description": "The conference featured sessions on investigative reporting and data journalism. It was attended by journalists from around the world.",
  "keywords": ["investigative reporting", "data journalism", "journalism conference"]
}
```
