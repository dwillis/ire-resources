Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "4601",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "The text provides tips and techniques for investigative reporters to conduct effective interviews and gather information. It covers topics such as building rapport, asking questions, and verifying facts.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative reporting",
    "interviewing",
    "fact-checking"
  ]
}
```

Note: Since the input text does not mention a specific author, conference, year, or title, I have left those fields as null or "Not Listed". The description is a brief summary of the text in simple language. The keywords are a list of relevant terms excluding the conference and authors.
