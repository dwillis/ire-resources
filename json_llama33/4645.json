Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```
{
  "id": "4645",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Using VLOOKUP to compare Medicare Advantage penetration rates",
  "description": "This tutorial shows how to use the VLOOKUP function in Excel to compare Medicare Advantage participation rates between 2013 and 2014. It provides step-by-step instructions on how to prepare data, create a unique ID field, and use VLOOKUP to pull data from one spreadsheet into another.",
  "keywords": [
    "VLOOKUP",
    "Excel",
    "Medicare Advantage",
    "data analysis"
  ]
}
```

Note that I didn't find any author names or affiliations in the input text, so I left those fields as null. I also assumed the conference was NICAR based on the context of the text, but if you're not sure, please let me know and I can change it to "Not Listed". Additionally, I excluded the year since it was not clearly identified in the input text. Let me know if you need any further changes!
