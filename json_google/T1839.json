  "description": "The U.S. plans to spend several billion dollars over the next few years creating new biosafety labs and updating others. NIH will issue contracts for the construction of these new facilities later this year. But the proliferation of these new labs also raises a number of security concerns, including the possible theft of these lethal bio-agents by insiders, the accidental release of these agents into the local environment and the potential vulnerability of these sites to a terrorist attack.",
