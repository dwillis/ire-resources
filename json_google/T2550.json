Thank you for your presentation, David. I have a few questions.

First, can you tell us more about the cost of contract fraud in the transportation industry?

Second, what are some of the red flags that you would look for in a transportation project that might indicate fraud?

Third, what can the media do to help fight transportation contract fraud?

Thank you again for your time.
