  "description": "The visual storytelling process should start at the very beginning of your project. Here are a few things to keep in mind: Think visually from the moment you begin to research an investigative story. Take viewers inside the process of how you did your investigation. Stand-Ups â€“ Make it more than just the reporters face! Show methodology; use it as a means to tell an element of the story. Work as a team with your photographers and editors. They can give you valuable input on how to tell the story. Identify your strongest pieces of tape and space them throughout the story, to keep the viewer riveted.",
