This is a great resource for anyone who wants to learn more about corporate sleuthing. I especially appreciate the tips on how to use SEC filings and other public records to track down information about companies and their executives. I'm sure I'll be referring back to this document often in my own work.

One thing I would add is that it's also important to be aware of the limitations of public records. For example, SEC filings are only required to include certain types of information, and they may not always be accurate or complete. Additionally, public records can be difficult to search and analyze, especially if you're not familiar with the relevant databases.

That's why it's often helpful to work with a professional researcher who can help you navigate the public records and identify the most relevant information for your story. A good researcher can also help you track down non-public information, such as internal documents and emails.

Overall, this is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn more about corporate sleuthing. I highly recommend it.
