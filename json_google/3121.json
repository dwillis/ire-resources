1. **Start with a good tip.** The best consumer investigations start with a good tip from a reader or viewer. If you don't have any tips, you can always start by looking for common consumer complaints online or in your local newspaper.
2. **Do your research.** Once you have a tip, it's important to do your research. This includes looking up the company or business in question, reading online reviews, and talking to other consumers who have had similar experiences.
3. **Interview the people involved.** Once you've done your research, it's time to interview the people involved. This includes the company or business owner, the consumers who have been affected, and any experts who can shed light on the issue.
4. **Be prepared to be persistent.** Consumer investigations can be challenging, and you may not always get the answers you're looking for. It's important to be persistent and keep digging until you get to the bottom of the story.
5. **Tell the story in a way that will resonate with your audience.** When you're writing or reporting on a consumer investigation, it's important to tell the story in a way that will resonate with your audience. This means using clear and concise language, and focusing on the human element of the story.
6. **Follow up.** Once you've published your story, it's important to follow up to see if there have been any changes. This could include talking to the company or business owner again, or checking in with the consumers who were affected.

By following these tips, you can conduct consumer investigations that will make a difference in the lives of your readers or viewers.
