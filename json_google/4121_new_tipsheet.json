Thank you for sharing your Excel Magic with us! I found it very helpful and informative. I especially appreciate the tips on how to use date and time functions, as well as the text and string functions. I will definitely be using these in my own work.

I also found the section on logical functions to be very helpful. I had never used IF statements before, but now I understand how they work and how I can use them to make my data analysis more efficient.

Thank you again for sharing your knowledge!
