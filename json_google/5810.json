This is a great handout! I'm a big fan of WONDER and I think it's a really valuable resource for journalists. I especially appreciate the way you've broken down the process into a series of steps, making it easy to follow along. I also think the examples you've provided are really helpful.

I have a few questions:

1. In your first exercise, you use the example of Ashtabula County, Ohio. I'm wondering if you could provide some more context for that choice. Why did you pick Ashtabula County?
2. In your second exercise, you talk about the importance of age-adjusted death rates. I'm wondering if you could provide some more detail on that. What are age-adjusted death rates and why are they important?
3. Finally, I'm wondering if you could provide some more information on the limitations of WONDER. What are some of the things to keep in mind when using this data?

Thanks again for this great handout!
