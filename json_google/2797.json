  "description": "The Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) is a full tabulation of employees covered by unemployment insurance. The data is drawn from information businesses are required to file with the states. The QCEW reports the number of employees, aggregate and average pay and counts of business establishments, broken down by government and private industry sectors. Because it's a census, there's no margin of error that grows as you drill down geographically. Unlike the Current Employment Survey, the QCEW doesn't stop at metro areas. It provides comparable data for every county in the nation.",
