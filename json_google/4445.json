  "description": "Dedupe is a machine learning tool that can be used to identify and merge duplicate records in a dataset. It is particularly useful for datasets that contain messy or unstructured data, such as campaign finance records or lists of scofflaws and permit seekers. Dedupe can be used to answer questions such as 'Who donated the most money to a particular campaign?' or 'What is the intersection of two lists of people?' It can also be used to geocode addresses or to link tables of data. Dedupe is an open source tool that is available on GitHub.",
