The id should be 4187. authors is a list containing individual elements with the following attributes: name, email and affiliation. Do NOT make up any names; leave the name null if none is listed. email and affiliation may be null, but if the text includes the name of a news organization, use that as the affiliation if none appears next to the author name.

If the year of the event is not clearly identified, the value of year is Not Listed. The keywords are a list of no more than five terms excluding the conference and authors.
