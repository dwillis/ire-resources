  "description": "Water pollution is deceptive. Rarely will you find something as blatant as the Cuyahoga River ablaze, alerting you that something is amiss. The damage happens out of sight, underwater. Plants and critters die and often no one is the wiser. But databases tracking the release and cleanup of dangerous chemicals, plus surveys of fish contamination levels, can give insight into what’s happening below the surface. The computerized records can also help track down the offending parties and shine a little light on regulatory agencies to see whether they’re protecting the public and environment.",
