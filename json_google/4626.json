  "description": "The USA TODAY Diversity Index is a measure of the racial and ethnic diversity of a population. It was created in 1991 by Philip Meyer of the University of North Carolina and Shawn McIntosh of USA TODAY. The index is based on the following factors: the percentage of the population that is white, black, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American; the percentage of the population that is foreign-born; and the percentage of the population that speaks a language other than English at home. The index is calculated for each county in the United States. The index can be used to track changes in diversity over time and to compare the diversity of different counties.",
