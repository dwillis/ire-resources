Here is a sample rake task for loading data from a CSV file:

```ruby
desc "load the data"
task :csv => :environment do
  require 'csv'

  # Open the CSV file
  csv_file = File.open('db/initial/schools.csv', 'r')

  # Create a new array to store the data
  schools = []

  # Iterate over the rows in the CSV file
  csv_file.each do |row|
    # Create a new school object
    school = School.new

    # Set the school's name
    school.name = row[0]

    # Set the school's kind
    school.kind = row[1]

    # Set the school's students
    school.students = row[2]

    # Set the school's teachers
    school.teachers = row[3]

    # Add the school to the array
    schools << school
  end

  # Save the schools to the database
  School.import schools
end
```

To run this task, you can use the following command:

```
rake csv
```

This will load the data from the CSV file into the database.
