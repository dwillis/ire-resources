  "description": "The beat is just an extended investigation, so set long-term story goals and begin building long-term projects. Don't get mired in minutiae or become a player in the game. Rise above. Own this turf and set your own agenda. Don't accept story ideas from publicists or media handlers. Don't accept praise from the same. Question the narrative and the rhetoric.",
