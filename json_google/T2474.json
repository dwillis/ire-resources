Thank you for sharing this handout. It is very informative and helpful. I will definitely keep these tips in mind when conducting interviews in the future.

I especially appreciate the advice on how to deal with reluctant interviewees. I have found that it can be very difficult to get people to talk to you, especially if they are afraid of being criticized or punished. However, I think the techniques you describe in this handout will be very helpful in overcoming these obstacles.

I also appreciate the advice on how to identify liars. This is something that I have always struggled with, but I think the tips you provide will be very helpful.

Overall, I think this is an excellent handout and I am very grateful for your sharing it with me.
