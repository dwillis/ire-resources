This is a great list of resources for background research. I would add a few more:

* **Court records:** These can be found at the county level and can include information on arrests, convictions, and civil lawsuits.
* **Property records:** These can be found at the county level and can include information on home ownership, liens, and bankruptcies.
* **Newspaper archives:** These can be found online or at the library and can provide information on a person's activities and public statements.
* **Social media:** This can be a great way to find information about a person's interests, activities, and connections. However, it's important to be aware that social media can be misleading, as people often present a curated version of themselves online.
* **Interviews:** This can be a valuable way to get first-hand information about a person from those who know them. However, it's important to be aware of the potential for bias in interviews, as people may be reluctant to share negative information about someone they know.

It's important to note that not all of these resources will be available for every person. Some people are more private than others, and they may not have a public record. Additionally, some records may be sealed or unavailable to the public.

If you're not sure where to start, a good place to go is the library. Librarians are experts in finding information, and they can help you navigate the resources available to you.
