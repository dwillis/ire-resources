The damage happens out of sight, underwater. But databases tracking the release and cleanup of dangerous chemicals, plus surveys of fish contamination levels, can give insight into whatâ€™s happening below the surface. The computerized records can also help track down the polluters and show whether regulatory agencies are protecting the public and environment.",
