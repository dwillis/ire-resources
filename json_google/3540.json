  "description": "More than 190,000 unsolved murders have been committed from 1980 to 2009. A third of all homicides have not been cleared through arrest. The FBI has officially stated that there are hundreds of uncaught serial killers in the United States. If you work in a medium- to large-size city, the odds are very good that there are unsolved serial killings in your community. Sometimes the police are aware that they are chasing multiple-victim killers. Sometimes they aren't. You can track how many unsolved killings there are in your area by accessing the Uniform Crime Reports at www.scrippsnews.com/projects/murdermysteries. You can look at the murder solution rates among different kinds of victims within your communities by accessing the FBI's Supplementary Homicide Reports at www.scrippsnews.com/projects/serial-killers. If you think you have detected a pattern of unsolved killings, please contact national correspondent Tom Hargrove in Washington, DC. He can offer advice on how to proceed. Cases committed in the mid 1990s and early may have DNA evidence that was never entered into the FBI's CODIS database. It is common for police to fail to recognize a homicide series, a phenomenon experts call "pattern blindness" because homicide investigations are usually case-centric.",
