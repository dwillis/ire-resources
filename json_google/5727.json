Thank you for sharing these tips. I think it's important for journalists to take care of themselves, both physically and mentally. Stress can be a major obstacle to productivity, so it's important to find ways to manage it. I appreciate the honesty of these journalists in sharing their own experiences and coping mechanisms. I think it's helpful to know that we're not alone in dealing with stress, and that there are healthy ways to cope.
