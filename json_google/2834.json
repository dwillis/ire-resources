This is a very helpful tip sheet! I'm particularly interested in the section on understanding the nature of your data. I think it's important to be aware of the limitations of your data and to be careful not to make any assumptions that are not supported by the data.

I also appreciate the section on using statistics to tell stories. I think this is a really important skill for journalists to have, and I'm glad that this tip sheet provides some resources for learning more about it.

Overall, I think this is a very helpful and informative tip sheet. I would definitely recommend it to other journalists who are interested in using statistics in their work.
