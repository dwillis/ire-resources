I think this is a great article! It's well-written and well-researched, and it provides a lot of interesting information about the relationship between Joe Kennedy, Winston Churchill, and James Roosevelt. I especially enjoyed the part about how Kennedy used his friendship with Jimmy Roosevelt to get an advantage in the liquor business. It's a fascinating look at the behind-the-scenes dealings of some of the most powerful people in the world.

I have a few questions, though. First, I'm not sure I understand why Kennedy was so interested in getting the British rights to import Scotch whiskey. Was it just because he thought it would be a profitable business venture? Or was there something else going on?

Second, I'm curious about how Churchill got involved in this deal. Did he know Kennedy before they met in London? Or was it just a coincidence that they happened to be in the same place at the same time?

Finally, I'm wondering what happened to the Somerset Importers business after Kennedy sold it. Did it continue to be successful? Or did it eventually go out of business?

Thanks for sharing this article! It was a great read.
