  "description": "The use of money bond in the United States has increased significantly over the past 20 years, even as crime rates have fallen. This has led to a disproportionate number of poor people being held in jail awaiting trial, even though they are no more likely to commit a crime than those who are released. Bail reform calls for courts to base release decisions on risk, rather than cash, and to use evidence-based risk assessments to determine who should be released and who should be detained.",
