Sure, here is a JSON object based on the contents of the text:

```json
{
  "id": "T1794",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Andy Lehren",
      "email": "andy@nicar.org",
      "affiliation": "National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "1997",
  "title": "Make A Map Your Way",
  "description": "A beginning class with ArcView 3.0",
  "keywords": [
    "ArcView",
    "mapping",
    "data analysis",
    "segregation"
  ]
}
```

I hope this is helpful!
