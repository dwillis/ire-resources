  "description": "This paper provides strategies for setting up data teams in small organizations in developing countries. It argues that data journalism can be a powerful tool for informing citizens and holding governments accountable, and that it can be done with limited resources. The paper offers five key recommendations: don't reinvent the wheel, start with the data you have, start with the question, it's about the story, not the visualizations, and don't do it alone.",
