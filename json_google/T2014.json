  "description": "Beat reporters covering state, federal or municipal courts often spot or feel trends on the fly. They may sense, for instance, that white-collar criminals face penalties less severe than those convicted of drug possession and other crimes. They may believe courts or judges administer justice unequally, sentencing one group of offenders more harshly than others. But how can a reporter substantiate those feelings or quantify those differences? Here is one way to start: TRACFED (http://tracfed.syr.edu/) part of the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, maintains federal prosecution, sentencing and other data online and offers a subscription query service. TRACFED allows reporters to construct queries that will provide data on various agencies, such as the IRS, DEA or FBI, or to look at various crimes or groups of crimes overall or in different federal districts.",
