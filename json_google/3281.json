  "description": "Probation systems are the red-haired stepchildren of the justice system: overloaded with offenders, underfunded by the legislature, unappreciated by the public, and generally ignored by the press. Done well, probation can get offenders off drugs, into jobs and out of trouble, for a fraction of the cost of prison. Done poorly, probation can let offenders run wild and create havoc in the community.",
