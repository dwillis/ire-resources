  "description": "KARE 11's investigation exposed more than 80% of Minnesota school districts were not complying with state and federal radon testing recommendations. The CDC says radon is the 2nd leading cause of lung cancer, after smoking, and is responsible for more than 20,000 deaths each year. The day after the investigation aired the Governor promised executive action, and within a week, new legislation was introduced to make radon testing in schools mandatory.",
