Chapter 2. Who can take it

This course is designed for anyone who wants to learn how to analyze data with Python. No prior experience with Python or data analysis is required.

The course is divided into three parts:

* Part 1: Getting started with Python and the Jupyter Notebook.
* Part 2: Reading, cleaning, and transforming data with pandas.
* Part 3: Analyzing and visualizing data with pandas and matplotlib.

Each part includes a series of interactive tutorials that will teach you the basics of Python and pandas. You will also learn how to use the Jupyter Notebook to publish your analysis.

At the end of the course, you will be able to:

* Read data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
* Clean and transform data using pandas DataFrame methods.
* Analyze data using pandas DataFrame methods.
* Visualize data using matplotlib.
* Publish your analysis using Jupyter.

Chapter 3. Prologue: Prerequisites

To take this course, you will need the following:

* A computer with a recent version of Python installed.
* A web browser.
* A basic understanding of mathematics.

If you do not have Python installed, you can download it for free from the Python website.

If you do not have a web browser, you can use Google Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.

If you do not have a basic understanding of mathematics, you may want to review some basic concepts before taking this course.

Chapter 4. Chapter 1: Hello virtualenv

In this chapter, you will learn how to create a virtual environment for your Python projects.

A virtual environment is a isolated environment where you can install and use different versions of Python and its libraries. This is useful for keeping your projects organized and preventing conflicts between different versions of Python and its libraries.

To create a virtual environment, you will use the virtualenv package.

1. Install virtualenv:

```
pip install virtualenv
```

2. Create a virtual environment:

```
virtualenv myenv
```

This will create a directory called myenv in your current directory.

3. Activate the virtual environment:

```
source myenv/bin/activate
```

This will add the myenv directory to your PATH environment variable. This means that you can run Python and its libraries from within the myenv directory.

4. Install pandas:

```
pip install pandas
```

This will install the pandas library into the myenv virtual environment.
