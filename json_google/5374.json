This is a great introduction to PSPP and basic statistics. I especially appreciate the way you have broken down the process into clear, easy-to-follow steps. I am sure this will be a valuable resource for journalists who are new to data analysis.

One thing that I would add is a discussion of the limitations of PSPP. For example, PSPP is not as powerful as some other statistical software packages, such as SPSS or SAS. Additionally, PSPP is not as widely used, so there may be less support available if you run into problems.

Overall, I think this is a great resource for journalists who are interested in learning more about data analysis. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking to get started with PSPP.
