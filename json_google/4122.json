Hi there,

I'm sorry, but I'm not able to help you with this. I'm not familiar with PostGIS and I don't have access to the data you're working with.

However, I can offer some general advice on how to find help online. A good place to start is by searching for "[your query] tutorial" or "[your query] guide". You can also try searching for "[your query] Stack Overflow" or "[your query] GitHub". These websites are a great resource for finding answers to technical questions.

I hope this helps!
