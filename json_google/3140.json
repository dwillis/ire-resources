  "description": "The Pearl Project is a collaborative investigative reporting course in which students learn to employ the same information gathering skills used by working journalists. The project is organized like a newsroom. Students receive a real-world assignment, choose beats, map reporting strategies, develop primary human sources, conduct interviews, cull databases for information, collaborate, collate complicated information, resolve ethical dilemmas, analyze information, write stories and create multimedia packages. By doing first-hand reporting, students gain an appreciation for the challenges of reporting and the deep sense of accomplishment that comes from successful information gathering.",
