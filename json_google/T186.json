  "description": "The St. Louis Post-Dispatch investigates the National Flood Insurance Program and finds that it is broken, lenders flout the law, local officials fail to enforce zoning and other building requirements, private insurance agents refuse to actively market federal flood insurance, and many of those who do buy flood insurance collect on it over and over again without doing anything to flood-proof their home and without any government agency requiring them to move to safer areas.",
