Sure, here is a JSON object based on the contents of the text:

```json
{
  "id": "T2419",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Tisha Thompson",
      "email": "thompson@wmar.com",
      "affiliation": "WMAR-TV"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2005",
  "title": "SMALL MARKET OR SMALL STAFF? HOW TO STILL DO INVESTIGATIONS",
  "description": "Easy and Intermediate Story Ideas",
  "keywords": ["investigations", "small market", "small staff", "tips", "ideas"]
}
```

I hope this is helpful!
