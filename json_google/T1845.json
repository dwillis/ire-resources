I have read the tip sheet and the attached scripts. I think they are very helpful and informative. I appreciate the time and effort that Sharyl Attkisson put into writing them.

I think the tip sheet is particularly helpful for journalists who are new to investigating whistleblower stories. It provides a lot of practical advice on how to find and cultivate whistleblowers, how to deal with them, and how to verify their information.

The scripts are also very helpful. They provide examples of how whistleblower stories can be told in a compelling and informative way.

I think the tip sheet and the scripts are a valuable resource for journalists who are interested in investigating whistleblower stories.
