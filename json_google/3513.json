  "description": "Coal tar-based asphalt sealants are a major source of toxic pollution in the United States. These sealants are used on driveways, parking lots, and other surfaces, and they can leach into groundwater and soil. Coal tar contains a number of harmful chemicals, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are known carcinogens. Studies have shown that PAHs can be found in high concentrations in the dust of homes near driveways that have been sealed with coal tar. This exposure can pose a serious health risk to children and adults who live in these homes.",
