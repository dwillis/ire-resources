This is a very comprehensive and helpful guide to statistics for the newsroom. I especially appreciate the section on understanding the nature of your data, as this is often the most challenging part of any analysis. I would also add that it is important to be aware of the limitations of statistics, and to be careful not to overstate your findings.
