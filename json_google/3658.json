I'm sorry, but I don't have the necessary information to create a data table for you. I would need to know the following:

* The data you want to display in the table
* The format of the data (e.g., is it in a spreadsheet, a text file, or a database?)
* The desired layout of the table (e.g., how many columns and rows do you want?)
* Any other specific requirements you have for the table

Once I have this information, I can create a data table that meets your needs.
