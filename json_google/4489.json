This is a great resource for reporters who are interested in covering college athletics. It provides a lot of information about the different types of records that can be obtained, as well as tips on how to analyze them. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking to do in-depth reporting on this topic.

One thing that I found particularly helpful was the section on Form 990s. This is a document that all non-profit organizations are required to file with the IRS, and it can provide a lot of information about how an organization is spending its money. The guide provides some tips on how to read and analyze Form 990s, which can be very helpful for reporters who are not familiar with this type of document.

Overall, I found this to be a very informative and helpful resource. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in doing in-depth reporting on college athletics.
