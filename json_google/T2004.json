  "description": "The overrepresentation of blacks in the nation’s prisons is well documented, but lesser known is the disproportionate number of black youth charged as adults and sentenced to adult prisons. The Tampa Tribune examined 3½ years’ arrest and sentencing data and found that a startling 67 percent of minors sentenced to adult time in Florida are black. A similar, but much smaller, imbalance is found among adult Florida prisoners, who are 53 percent black.",
