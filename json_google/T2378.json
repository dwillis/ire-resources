  "description": "The law declares openness to be the public policy of the state. The law says that 'each official meeting of a public body shall be open to the public, and any person is entitled to attend such a meeting.' A public body is defined as 'any elected or appointed authority, board, commission, committee, council or other body of the State, or of one or more counties, cities, school administrative units, constituent institutions of The University of North Carolina, or other political subdivisions or public corporations in the State' consisting of two or more people that exercises or is authorized to exercise legislative, policy-making, quasi-judicial, administrative or advisory functions. The law also applies to governing boards of public hospitals, but it exempts a number of bodies, including courts, the Judicial Standards Commission, Legislative Ethics Committee and legislative conference committees. The professional staffs of government agencies are not covered. An official meeting occurs whenever a majority of the body meets together to take action, hold a hearing, deliberate or otherwise transact public business. Electronic meetings, e.g., 'simultaneous communication' by conference calls, are covered by the law. Radio and TV stations are entitled to broadcast and any person may photograph, film or record any meeting that is required to be open under the law. A public body may regulate the placement of equipment and may require pooling, however. Public notice is required for all meetings of public bodies. The type of notice required depends on whether the meeting is a regular meeting, a special meeting, an emergency meeting or a recessed meeting. The law contains nine justifications for closed sessions: 1) to consider the hiring, firing and performance of employees, including hearing grievances by or against employees; 2) to receive legal advice from an attorney; 3) to instruct staff on negotiations for acquiring property or negotiating the terms of employment contracts; 4) to discuss potential new or expanding industry; 5) to plan or hear reports on criminal investigations; 6) to prevent premature disclosure of honor or award recipients; 7) to prevent disclosure of information required to be kept confidential by state or federal law, such as certain student records and personnel records; 8) to formulate plans by a local board of education relating to emergency response to incidents of school violence; 9) to discuss and take action regarding plans to protect public safety as it relates to existing or potential terrorist activity and to receive briefings by staff members, legal counsel, or law enforcement or emergency service officials concerning actions taken or to be taken to respond to such activity. Before a public body may go into closed session, a motion stating the purpose of the closure, in terms of the specific statutory exemption being used, must be made and approved by a majority of the body in open session. '[F]ull and accurate' minutes must be kept of closed sessions, but such minutes may be kept confidential "so long as public inspection would frustrate the purpose of a closed session." Anyone who believes the law has been violated or is about to be violated can go to court and seek an injunction prohibiting continued or threatened violations of the law. The court can also void any actions taken at an illegally closed meeting. The court may award the winning party attorney's fees and may order public officials who intentionally break the law to personally pay the legal fees of the winner. Courts are supposed to expedite the hearing of Open Meetings Law cases.'",
