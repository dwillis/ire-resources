  "description": "Data journalism is a rapidly growing field that uses data to tell stories. However, data journalism is also ephemeral, as news organizations often delete their data and interactives after they are published. This paper presents a new tool called ReproZip that can be used to archive data journalism projects. ReproZip captures the entire environment in which a data journalism project was created, including the data, code, and environment variables. This allows data journalism projects to be reproduced and studied long after they have been published.",
