Here are some ideas for data-driven stories that you could write about:

* **Vendors multiply for food stamps.** The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as food stamps, is a federal program that provides food assistance to low-income individuals and families. In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of vendors who accept SNAP benefits. This could be due to a number of factors, such as the expansion of SNAP eligibility or the increasing availability of electronic benefits transfer (EBT) cards. A data-driven story about this topic could explore the reasons for the increase in vendors, the impact on SNAP recipients, and the potential implications for the program.
* **Medical response times lag in many pricey L.A. neighborhoods.** A recent study found that medical response times in some of Los Angeles' most expensive neighborhoods are significantly longer than in other parts of the city. This could be due to a number of factors, such as the location of fire stations and the availability of ambulances. A data-driven story about this topic could explore the reasons for the longer response times, the impact on residents, and the potential solutions.
* **Harsh winter bringing huge toll of highway pileups.** The winter of 2013-2014 was one of the harshest on record in the United States, with record-breaking snowfall and ice storms. This led to a number of highway pileups, some of which were deadly. A data-driven story about this topic could explore the factors that contributed to the pileups, the impact on drivers, and the potential solutions.
* **St. Paul gun incident reports up 65% so far in 2012.** The city of St. Paul, Minnesota, has seen a significant increase in gun violence in recent years. In 2012, the number of gun incidents reported to the police was up 65% from the previous year. This could be due to a number of factors, such as the availability of guns, the drug trade, or gang violence. A data-driven story about this topic could explore the reasons for the increase in gun violence, the impact on residents, and the potential solutions.
* **Hillsborough PTC sued for setting minimum limo prices.** The Hillsborough County Public Transportation Commission (PTC) is facing a lawsuit from a group of limo companies who claim that the PTC's minimum limo prices are unfair. The PTC set the minimum prices in an effort to protect consumers from being overcharged. However, the limo companies argue that the prices are too high and are driving them out of business. A data-driven story about this topic could explore the reasons for the lawsuit, the impact on limo companies and consumers, and the potential solutions.
* **Water use highest in poor areas of the city.** A recent study found that water use is highest in poor areas of the city. This could be due to a number of factors, such as the lack of air conditioning, the use of water for cooking and cleaning, or the lack of water conservation efforts. A data-driven story about this topic could explore the reasons for the high water use in poor areas, the impact on residents, and the potential solutions.
