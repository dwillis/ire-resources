  "description": "Databases are a great way to confirm a hunch, find a story you didn’t expect to find, or to get information without officials knowing exactly what you’re looking for. They continue to be valuable for years as look-up tools, and as comparisons for year-to-year changes in government. A database for broadcast is the same as any other reporter’s tool; you still have to complete your research, find the people affected, do your interviews, and write your story. The story is not the database. The best TV stories, and the best print stories, usually make only a passing reference to the computer aspect of the story.",
