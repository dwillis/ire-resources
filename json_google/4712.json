Here is a sample data cleaning code using regular expressions in Python:

```python
import re

# Read the data from a file
data = open('socrata_addresses.txt', 'r').read()

# Split the data into lines
lines = data.splitlines()

# Create a regular expression pattern to capture the address, city, state, zip, latitude and longitude
pattern = r'^"(.*)\n([\w ]+), (TX) (\d*)\n\(([\d\.]+), ([\d\-\.]+)\)$'

# Replace the data with the regular expression pattern
new_data = re.sub(pattern, r'\1\t\2\t\3\t\4\t\5', data)

# Write the new data to a file
open('socrata_addresses_cleaned.txt', 'w').write(new_data)
```

This code will split the data into lines, create a regular expression pattern to capture the address, city, state, zip, latitude and longitude, and then replace the data with the regular expression pattern. The new data will be written to a file called `socrata_addresses_cleaned.txt`.
