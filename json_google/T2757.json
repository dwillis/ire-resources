  "description": "Tips for finding investigative story ideas, including looking at your beat critically, keeping running lists of investigative tips and ideas, finding a few really good sources and picking their brains regularly, reading other newspapers and projects in IRE's resource library, looking especially critically at the obscure and often-neglected parts of your beat, trying a profile or explainer on a person or situation, trying the three-notebook approach, doing something on your best investigative idea every day, talking to your editor when you've done enough pre-reporting to convince yourself there's a decent story there, writing a story or project proposal, trying to do the bulk of the reporting while still doing your beat essentials, outlining before you write, and not stopping with one investigative story.",
