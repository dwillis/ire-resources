Thank you for sharing these tips. I think it is important for journalists to take care of their mental health, and these tips are a great way to do that. I will definitely try some of them myself.

I think it is also important to remember that everyone copes with stress differently, and what works for one person might not work for another. So it is important to find what works best for you and to be kind to yourself.
