Russ Buettner is a staff writer for the New York Daily News. He has won numerous awards for his reporting, including the Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting in 2006.

In his presentation at the 2006 NICAR National Conference, Buettner discussed his reporting on the use of federal funds after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. He focused on the $21 billion in aid that was promised to New York City.

Buettner said that he and his colleagues at the Daily News were able to track the use of this money by obtaining data from a variety of sources, including the federal government, the state of New York, and the city of New York. They also conducted interviews with officials and residents.

Buettner's reporting revealed that much of the $21 billion was not used effectively. For example, he found that millions of dollars were spent on projects that were not related to the 9/11 attacks, such as a new baseball stadium for the New York Mets. He also found that many small businesses that were supposed to receive aid did not get it.

Buettner's reporting was critical of the way that the federal government, the state of New York, and the city of New York handled the $21 billion in aid. He argued that the money could have been used more effectively to help the victims of the 9/11 attacks and to rebuild the city.

Buettner's reporting is an example of how journalists can use data to hold government officials accountable. By tracking the use of federal funds, Buettner and his colleagues were able to expose waste and mismanagement. Their reporting helped to ensure that the victims of the 9/11 attacks received the help they needed.
