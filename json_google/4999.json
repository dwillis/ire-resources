  "title": "It Ain't Just the Epi-Pen Folks! The Rising Cost of Prescription Drugs",
  "description": "A series that focused on the rising costs of drugs and those who are affected. The series focused on those with high deductible healthcare plans who pay the full price of drugs at the pharmacy counter, and those people with insurance who are still getting a bad deal because Pharmacy Benefit Managers charge their insurance more for certain drugs – sometimes more than the cash price of drugs without insurance. The series looked at the pharmaceutical supply chain – how RX drugs are getting more and more expensive at every step, and how massive companies, particularly PBMs are raking in huge profits. It also examined the pharmaceutical industry’s influence in Washington through lobbying and campaign contributions, and the power of marketing on television and through payments to doctors.",
