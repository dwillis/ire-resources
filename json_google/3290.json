PIDS is a database of more than 90,000 specific pesticide exposures from 1992 through 2007. The data can be used to identify trends in pesticide exposure, to investigate specific incidents, and to assess the public health impact of pesticides. The presentation will also discuss the limitations of PIDS and how to use it in conjunction with other data sources.",
