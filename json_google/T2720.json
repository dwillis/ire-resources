I think this is a great handout! It's very comprehensive and covers a lot of different topics. I especially like the section on "Getting All the Goods," which provides some really helpful tips on how to get the most out of an interview.

One thing I would add is that it's important to be prepared for anything during an interview. Sometimes, people will say things that you don't expect, and it's important to be able to think on your feet and come up with follow-up questions. It's also important to be respectful of the person you're interviewing, and to make sure that you're not asking them anything that they're not comfortable answering.

Overall, I think this is a great resource for anyone who wants to learn how to conduct better interviews. Thanks for sharing it!
