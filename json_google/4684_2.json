Here are some additional Excel tips:

* **SUMIF and COUNTIF** are two very useful functions that can be used to quickly summarize data. SUMIF will add up all the values in a range that meet a certain condition, while COUNTIF will count the number of values in a range that meet a certain condition. For example, you could use SUMIF to find the total sales for all customers in California, or you could use COUNTIF to find the number of customers who have made a purchase in the past 30 days.
* **Lookups** can be used to find the value in one range that corresponds to a value in another range. For example, you could use a lookup to find the customer name for a given customer ID, or you could use a lookup to find the product price for a given product ID.
* **Conditional formatting** can be used to highlight cells based on certain criteria. For example, you could use conditional formatting to highlight all cells that contain a value greater than 100, or you could use conditional formatting to highlight all cells that contain a value that is less than the average value in the range.
* **Pivot tables** can be used to summarize data in a variety of ways. For example, you could use a pivot table to find the total sales for each product, or you could use a pivot table to find the average sales for each customer.
* **Power Query** is a powerful tool that can be used to clean and transform data. For example, you could use Power Query to remove duplicate rows from a table, or you could use Power Query to convert a table into a pivot table.
* **Tableau Reshaper** is a tool that can be used to connect Excel to Tableau. This allows you to easily create visualizations of your data in Tableau.

I hope these tips are helpful!
