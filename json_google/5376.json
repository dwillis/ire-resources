Here are some additional tips for using QGIS:

* **Use the toolbars and menus to access common functions.** The toolbars at the top of the screen provide quick access to common functions, such as adding layers, styling data, and measuring distances. The menus on the left side of the screen provide access to more advanced functions.
* **Use the attribute table to view and edit data.** The attribute table displays the data associated with each feature on the map. You can use the attribute table to view, edit, and add new data.
* **Use the legend to understand how the map is displayed.** The legend displays the symbology used for each layer on the map. You can use the legend to understand what each symbol represents.
* **Use the scale bar to understand the scale of the map.** The scale bar displays the distance between two points on the map. You can use the scale bar to determine how far apart two features are in real life.
* **Use the ruler to measure distances and areas.** The ruler can be used to measure distances and areas on the map. You can use the ruler to calculate the distance between two features or the area of a polygon.
* **Use the print composer to create maps.** The print composer allows you to create high-quality maps that can be printed or exported to a variety of formats. You can use the print composer to add titles, legends, and other elements to your maps.
* **Use the help system to learn more about QGIS.** The help system provides information on all aspects of QGIS, including how to use the software, how to style data, and how to create maps. You can access the help system by clicking on the Help menu.

I hope these tips are helpful!
