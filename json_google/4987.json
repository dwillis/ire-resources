This is a great tipsheet! I'm sure it will be very helpful to reporters who are investigating sports. I especially like the idea of looking at social media, as that can be a great way to get a sense of what coaches and players are up to. I'm also glad to see that the tipsheet includes information on how to access public records, as that can be a valuable resource for reporters. Thanks for sharing this!
