This is a great exercise in importing, rearranging and cleaning data. It's important to be able to do this with government data, as it can often be messy and difficult to work with. The steps in this exercise are clear and easy to follow, and the results are definitely worth it.

I particularly appreciate the use of string functions to split up the names and dates. This is a very efficient way to clean up data, and it's something that I'll definitely be using in the future.

Overall, this is a very helpful and informative exercise. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who needs to work with government data.
