The Star-Ledger's investigation into the New Jersey State Police was a groundbreaking piece of journalism that exposed a culture of racial profiling and misconduct within the agency. The series of stories, which ran in 1998 and 1999, won the paper the 1999 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service.

The investigation began after two state troopers shot and wounded three unarmed black men on the New Jersey Turnpike in April 1998. The troopers claimed that the men had been acting suspiciously, but witnesses said that the men had done nothing wrong. The shooting sparked protests and calls for an investigation into the state police.

The Star-Ledger's reporters, Joe Donohue and Kathy Barrett Carter, obtained records showing that the state police had a long history of racial profiling. They also found that the agency had a culture of secrecy and that it had failed to discipline officers who had been accused of misconduct.

The Star-Ledger's investigation led to a number of reforms at the state police, including the creation of a new unit to investigate racial profiling and the adoption of new policies on the use of force. The investigation also led to the resignation of the state police superintendent.

The Star-Ledger's investigation into the New Jersey State Police was a courageous and important piece of journalism. It exposed a culture of racial profiling and misconduct within the agency and led to a number of reforms.
