This is a great list of records that journalists can use to investigate their communities. I would add a few more categories, such as:

* **Court records:** These can include things like criminal records, civil lawsuits, and divorce records. They can be a great source of information about people and businesses in your community.
* **Government contracts:** These are documents that detail the agreements between governments and businesses. They can be a great way to find out who is getting government money and what they are doing with it.
* **Lobbyist registration records:** These records list the people and organizations that are trying to influence government policy. They can be a great way to find out who is trying to influence government decisions and why.
* **Property records:** These records detail who owns what property in your community. They can be a great way to find out who is buying and selling property, and for what price.
* **Tax records:** These records detail how much money people and businesses pay in taxes. They can be a great way to find out who is paying their fair share of taxes and who is not.

These are just a few examples of the many different types of public records that journalists can use to investigate their communities. By understanding the types of records that are available and how to access them, journalists can hold government accountable and inform the public about what is happening in their communities.
