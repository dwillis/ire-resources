This is a great list of resources! I'm particularly interested in the data on hospital quality and the Environmental Protection Agency's enforcement records. These are both areas that I think are important to cover in journalism, and I'm glad to know that there are reliable sources of data available.

I also appreciate the tip about using the search function on the Census Bureau's website. This is a great way to find specific data on a particular topic. I've used it in the past to find information on demographics and housing, and I'm sure I'll find it useful in the future.

Overall, this is a very helpful and informative tipsheet. Thank you for sharing it!
