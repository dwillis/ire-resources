  "description": "Algorithms are pervasive, but often hidden. They guide a lot of government/corporate decision-making, such as in criminal justice, credit scores, and home buying. But public entities are often reluctant to provide information about their algorithms, and private companies run many algorithms that are not subject to public records requests. This makes it difficult to understand how these algorithms work and whether they are fair. One way to learn more about an algorithm is to reverse-engineer it, which means trying to figure out how it works by looking at its inputs and outputs. This can be difficult, but it can be done in some cases. For example, in 2018, a journalist named Rob Arthur reverse-engineered Chicago's "heat list," which is a list of people who are considered to be at high risk of committing violence. Arthur found that the algorithm used to create the heat list was surprisingly simple, and that it was based on factors such as age, arrest history, and gang affiliation. This information can be used to hold governments and companies accountable for the algorithms they use, and to make sure that these algorithms are fair and unbiased."
