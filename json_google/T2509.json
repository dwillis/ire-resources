The article discusses the phenomenon of "repeat shooters" in the Los Angeles Police Department. These are officers who have been involved in multiple shootings, often involving the use of deadly force. The article explores the reasons why some officers seem to be more likely to shoot than others, and the implications of this for police departments and the communities they serve.

The article begins by noting that most police officers go through their entire careers without ever firing a shot in the line of duty. However, a small number of officers seem to be involved in shootings on a regular basis. The article identifies 103 officers who have been involved in three or more shootings since 1985. These officers represent less than 1% of the LAPD's force, but they were involved in 20% of all LAPD shootings during that time period.

The article then explores some of the possible reasons why some officers are more likely to shoot than others. Some experts believe that repeat shooters may be innately aggressive or anxious. Others suggest that they may have family problems or other personal issues that make them more likely to see danger where it does not exist. Still others believe that repeat shooters may simply be more likely to put themselves in dangerous situations, either through carelessness or poor judgment.

The article also discusses the implications of repeat shootings for police departments and the communities they serve. Police departments need to be aware of the existence of repeat shooters and take steps to monitor them and provide them with additional training and support. Communities also need to be aware of the risks posed by repeat shooters and demand that police departments take steps to protect them.

The article concludes by noting that the problem of repeat shooters is a complex one, and there is no easy solution. However, it is important for police departments and communities to work together to identify and address this problem.
