Sure, here is a JSON object based on the contents of the text with the following keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id should be 3843. authors is a list containing individual elements with the following attributes: name, email and affiliation. Do NOT make up any names; leave the name null if none is listed. email and affiliation may be null, but if the text includes the name of a news organization, use that as the affiliation if none appears next to the author name. The description should be a 1-2 sentence summary of the text in direct, simple language. The conference will be either NICAR or Not Listed. If the year of the event is not clearly identified, the value of year is Not Listed. The keywords are a list of no more than five terms excluding the conference and authors. The response must not be enclosed in any text or formatting:
