  "title": "Why Blind Recruiting & Hiring?",
  "description": "Blind hiring is any technique that anonymizes or “blinds” personal information that can lead to unconscious bias about the candidate. Blind hiring helps increase workplace diversity by allowing us to be more objective when evaluating a candidate’s skills, knowledge, and potential to succeed, free from biases about what a “good candidate” looks like (e.g., race, gender, age, education level). Currently, tools for blind screening and blind pre-hire testing exist, but whether we’ll ever see widespread adoption of blind interviewing remains to be seen. The success of your blind hiring program should be captured in metrics by measuring your diversity statistics for screening, shortlisting, testing, interviewing, hiring, and retention before and after.",
