  "description": "A flythrough is a quick, easy way to produce a visual story. It can be used to show a progression of events over time, help people to locate themselves in an unfamiliar place, or provide high quality satellite imagery. Flythroughs are often used in conjunction with other forms of visual storytelling, such as maps and timelines.",
