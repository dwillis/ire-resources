  "description": "Crime is generally covered well by newspapers and TV news organizations. But we too often rely on police officers and prosecutors to give us crucial information. Find other ways to tell the story. Find data that holds those authority figures accountable and leads you to the real stories. Your story may lead to the courts, where you will find that whitecollar criminals continually face penalties less severe than those convicted of drug possession and other crimes. You may examine police effectiveness or police corruption and misdeeds. You may find areas where poverty and hopelessness make crime inevitable. Don't just go on the ridealongs and write about heroic police officers bursting into the homes of criminals. Look behind the veil. Look for data that will part the armored curtain of the police department and the courts.",
