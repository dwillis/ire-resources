The Sunlight Foundation is a non-profit organization that advocates for transparency and accountability in government. It was founded in 2006 by former journalist and White House staffer Chris Hughes. The Sunlight Foundation's work includes tracking campaign finance data, lobbying disclosures, and government spending. It also operates a number of websites and tools that make it easier for people to access and understand government information.

The Sunlight Foundation's InfluenceExplorer.com website is a good resource for tracking campaign finance data. It allows users to search for contributions by individual donors, companies, and interest groups. It also provides data on lobbying expenditures and government contracts.

The Sunlight Foundation's Follow the Unlimited Money Tracker is another good resource for tracking campaign finance data. It focuses on independent expenditures and electioneering communications made by third-party groups. It allows users to filter information on candidates, the races they're competing in, and organizations. It offers aggregate totals, downloads of data, and links to the original filings on the FEC site.

The National Institute on Money in State Politics is a non-profit organization that tracks campaign finance data from all 50 states. It makes this data available in an online database at followthemoney.org. The Institute codes contributions by industry (using a method incredibly similar to OpenSecrets.org), and provides data on contributions to and from PACs, Super PACs, and 527s.

These are just a few of the many resources available for tracking campaign finance data. By understanding who is giving money to political campaigns and what they are getting in return, we can better hold our elected officials accountable.
