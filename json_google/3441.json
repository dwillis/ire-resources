  "description": "Local reporting is often stigmatized as a numbing procession of planning and zoning meetings, “not in my backyard” protests and feel good articles about people living on a particular block that the newspaper or station deems critical this week. Get past that notion. The term “local” limits only the geography you look at first, not the subject matter of your reporting. And knowing where to start can do more to empower you as a reporter than to minimize your scope.",
