  "description": "Reporters from every Virginia newspaper had a unique research tool for tracking the money chase in last year’s $30-million gubernatorial contest. The result was an unprecedented outpouring of articles in papers of all size, from bucolic weeklies to bigcity dailies. The Virginia Public Access Project provided the research tool in the form of a database of contributions to and expenditures by candidates for statewide office and the 140-seat General Assembly. The VPAP database – http://www.vpap.org/ – assigns a unique ID number to each donor, fingerprints donors’ economic interests and assigns a purpose code to each expenditure. VPAP is a non-profit organization that is funded in part by the Virginia Press Association and a consortium of six news organizations (The Associated Press, The Daily Press, The Richmond Times-Dispatch, The Roanoke Times, The Virginian-Pilot and The Washington Post). For an archive of articles published using VPAP data during the 2001 elections, point your browser to: http://www.vpap.org/vpa For information on getting started with a campaign finance database or how your state’s newspaper might form a consortium similar to the one in Virginia, contact David Poole at 804.343.4300 or dpoole@vpap.org",
