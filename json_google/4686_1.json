  "title": "Structured Journalism: A New Paradigm for News and Journalism",
  "description": "Structured journalism is an emerging form of journalism in which news is reported directly into a database as highly structured and interconnected data. That network of structured news data can then be reconstructed as needed into novel and adaptable digital news products, enabling news consumers to experience and explore journalism in entirely new ways. Structured journalism therefore provides an alternative to the traditional text article as a mechanism for gathering, aggregating and distributing journalism. Structured journalism is different from data journalism in that it involves reporting news into a database, whereas data journalism typically involves reporting news out of a database, usually an existing database and usually for publication as a text article. In computer science terms, structured journalism is about applying the techniques of knowledge representation to journalism.",
