This is a great memo! I especially like the way you have organized the information into clear and concise sections. The use of images and screenshots is also very helpful. I would only make a few minor suggestions:

* In the first section, you could add a sentence or two about why it is useful to be able to create maps based on polygons.
* In the second section, you could add a link to the diva-gis.org website.
* In the third section, you could add a sentence or two about how to use the KML file in Google Fusion Tables.

Overall, this is a very helpful and informative memo. Thank you for sharing it!
