The Washington Public Disclosure Act (PDA) is a law that gives the public the right to access government records. The PDA was passed in 1972 and has been amended several times since then. The PDA applies to all state and local government agencies, including school districts, city councils, and county governments.

The PDA requires agencies to make public records available for inspection and copying, unless the records are exempt from disclosure. There are 56 exemptions to the PDA, but most of them are narrow and do not apply to many records. Some common exemptions include records that would invade someone's privacy, records that are confidential by law, and records that are part of an ongoing investigation.

If you want to access a public record, you can request it from the agency that has it. The agency must respond to your request within five business days. If the agency denies your request, you can appeal the denial to the state Attorney General.

The PDA is an important tool for transparency and accountability in government. It allows the public to see what their government is doing and to hold their officials accountable.
