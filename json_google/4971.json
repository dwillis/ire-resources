Here are some additional tips for using QGIS:

* **Use the search bar.** The search bar at the top of the interface can be used to find specific tools, menus, and options.
* **Use the documentation.** The QGIS documentation is a great resource for learning more about the software. It can be accessed from the Help menu.
* **Join data layers.** Joining data layers allows you to combine information from multiple sources. This can be useful for creating more complex maps.
* **Use the style manager.** The style manager allows you to customize the appearance of your maps. You can change the symbology, labels, and other aspects of your maps.
* **Use the print composer.** The print composer allows you to create high-quality maps for printing. You can add titles, legends, and other elements to your maps.
* **Share your maps.** Once you have created a map, you can share it with others in a variety of ways. You can export it as a PDF, image, or web map.

I hope these tips are helpful!
