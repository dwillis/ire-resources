  "title": "Tips for Writing a Successful Pulitzer Center Proposal",
  "description": "The Pulitzer Center provides travel grants to cover hard costs associated with upcoming travel for international reporting projects. Grants are open to all journalists, writers, photographers, radio producers or filmmakers; staff journalists as well as free-lancers of any nationality are eligible to apply. There’s no magic formula for a successful proposal but here are some guidelines to keep in mind. Make it your own Journalists often ask us what topics we’re interested in seeing and we always turn the question back to them. The best proposals we receive come from journalists with a deep commitment to reporting on the topic they propose, and to finding as many ways as possible to engage audiences around the topic. We want the topic ideas to be generated by the journalists because they are passionate about it–not because there might be funding to report on it. Go deep The only parameter we have is that the project addresses a global systemic crisis. And by crisis we do not mean the headline-breaking crisis or conflict. We’re trying to raise awareness of the slow-moving crises, and support reporting that digs beneath the surface to answer the root causes of these crises, as well as possible responses to them. A crisis can be a conflict. Syria and Iraq are crises. But, so is the struggle for access to clean water and sanitation in Bangladesh, or the quiet struggle against female genital mutilation in parts of Africa, or the destruction of the rainforest in Malaysia. What we’re looking for are broad systemic crises that are underreported. Think beyond one story We support projects, not just one-off stories. Our overarching mission is to raise awareness of under-reported global crises so the most successful applications demonstrate that the journalist has thought about how to get the story out across numerous platforms to reach the widest possible audience. We encourage applicants to create partnerships with others and propose a complementary suite of deliverables to maximize their impact. Do some homework! The most common mistake that applicants make is they don’t check our website. They don’t check to see what projects we’ve already done, or what projects we’re currently doing. The Sudan is a good example. In the lead-up to the 2012 referendum in the Sudan, we were flooded with applicants who wanted to go and cover the story. If they had checked the website, they would have seen that we’d been covering this story for six months. Not that we wouldn’t accept another application or another project. In fact, we did. But you have to tell us how your approach is going to be different, or what gap in our coverage you’re going to fill. Be brief. Keep it simple. We know some stories are very complicated—and we give you space on the application form for supplementary material—but if you can’t explain what your story is about and why we should read it in 250 words or so, then you probably have some more homework to do.",
