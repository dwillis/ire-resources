Thank you for sharing your presentation, Michael. It was very informative and helpful. I learned a lot about how to use databases and other computer-mined information to track trends in the military. I also found your tips on building relationships with sources and getting access to information to be very valuable.

I am particularly interested in your work on the Joint Strike Fighter program. I think it is important for the public to be aware of how much money is being spent on these types of programs, and I appreciate your efforts to shed light on this issue.

I also found your discussion of the challenges of covering the military to be very insightful. I think it is important for reporters to be aware of the potential for bias and to do their best to be objective in their reporting.

Thank you again for sharing your work. I look forward to reading more of your reporting in the future.
