Thank you for sharing this tipsheet. I'm always looking for ways to improve my data analysis skills, and this looks like a great resource. I'll definitely be checking out the R package and the Python library that you mentioned.

I'm also interested in the idea of automating data analysis. It sounds like a great way to save time and ensure that your results are reproducible. I'll have to do some more research on this topic, but it definitely sounds like something that could be useful for my work.

Thanks again for sharing this tipsheet!
