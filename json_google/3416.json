  "description": "Just like human sources, datasets and recordsets have limitations, even shortcomings. This is particularly true of criminal justice data, a species of electronic records that carries a tortured history. Officials manipulate numbers for political ends. Police agencies categorize incidents erratically. Reporters erroneously tell the public that crime figures say things the data does not, and often cannot, say. The remedy is to gather information from other sources â€“ people and records from other parts of law enforcement, the courts, health care, etc. Here are some tips to help better understand the numbers and provide the public a truer view of law enforcement performance.",
