  "description": "Mistakes in investigative stories carry a high cost: loss of credibility for you and your news organization, corrections that call the whole story into question and possibly legal action. The vast majority of errors can be prevented with proper preparation and fact checking from the time you begin planning your project, through publication and even after, when responding to critics and pushback on social media.",
