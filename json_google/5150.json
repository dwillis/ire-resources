This is a great list of public records that can be used to inform stories. I would add a few more categories, such as:

* **Court records:** These can include things like criminal records, civil court cases, and divorce records. They can be a great source of information about people and events in your community.
* **Government contracts:** These can show you who is getting money from the government and for what. They can be a good way to track corruption and waste.
* **Lobbyist registration records:** These can show you who is trying to influence government policy and how much money they are spending to do it. They can be a good way to track special interests and their influence on government.
* **Property records:** These can show you who owns what property and for how much. They can be a good way to track development and gentrification in your community.
* **Tax records:** These can show you how much money people and businesses are paying in taxes. They can be a good way to track inequality and tax avoidance.

These are just a few examples of the many different types of public records that are available. By understanding what records are available and how to access them, you can use them to inform your reporting and hold government accountable.
