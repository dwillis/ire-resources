This is a great tipsheet! I'm always looking for ways to learn more about
nonprofits, and this is a great resource. Thanks for sharing.

Here are a few additional things to keep in mind when reading IRS Form 990:

* The form is very long and complex, so it's important to take your time and read it carefully.
* Not all of the information on the form is relevant to every nonprofit. For example, if a nonprofit doesn't have any employees, you won't need to pay attention to the section on compensation.
* It's helpful to have a basic understanding of accounting and financial statements before reading the form.
* If you have any questions about the form, you can always contact the IRS or a nonprofit expert.

I hope this is helpful!
