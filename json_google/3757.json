Here are some tips on how to stay afloat while waiting for word from the IRS:

* **Donâ€™t stop trying to raise funds.** Some funders or private donors might be willing to support your organization even if it doesn't have 501(c)(3) status yet. Explain your situation and why you believe your work is important.
* **Consider other sources of revenue.** If you're not able to raise enough money through donations, you might need to consider other sources of revenue, such as advertising or subscriptions.
* **Cut costs where possible.** This might mean reducing staff, cutting back on travel, or finding cheaper office space.
* **Be patient.** It can take a long time to get 501(c)(3) status, so be prepared to wait. In the meantime, focus on building your organization and doing good work.

Here are some things you can and can't do with an exempt organization:

* **You can use the organization's funds to pay for expenses related to your educational mission.** This includes things like salaries, rent, and office supplies.
* **You can't use the organization's funds to pay for personal expenses.** This includes things like travel, entertainment, and gifts.
* **You can't use the organization's funds to lobby for or against legislation.** This is considered political activity and is not allowed for 501(c)(3) organizations.
* **You can't use the organization's funds to endorse or oppose candidates for public office.** This is also considered political activity and is not allowed for 501(c)(3) organizations.

It's important to get legal assistance and risk management advice before starting a tax-exempt journalism organization. A lawyer can help you understand the laws and regulations that apply to your organization, and a risk manager can help you identify and manage potential risks.
