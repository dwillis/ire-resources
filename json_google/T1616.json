  "description": "Land records exist to do four or five basic things: Identify the owner. Identify anyone with claims against that land, including lenders, utilities and the taxman. Ensure building standards are met. Determine permissible uses of that land. Establish the exact location of a piece of property. Doesnâ€™t sound like much, does it? Yet reporters routinely mine land records to document hidden relationships, financial wrongdoing and abuses of public power. They also combine land records with other information to expose racial discrimination and shoddy building practices. The key is understanding where to find land records and what to look for when you find them.",
