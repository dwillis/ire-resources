  "description": "A CAR 301 staple: Get and analyze the local list of unpaid parking tickets. It has everything to sell a data-leery editor: open-and-shut findings; clear villains; a whiff of public service; guaranteed high reader interest; even the possibility of finding the powerful abusing their positions. Think of speeding tickets as a CAR 301 staple. The methodology is a bit more complicated. So is the analysis. But the breadth of story possibilities is much broader, and the public service component is real. Consider: Speeding is cited as a contributing cause of fatal accidents about as often as drugs and alcohol (There is some overlap.). Now think how much various government agencies spend preventing one vs. the other. Speeding ticket data also can be used to probe for racial profiling and discriminatory policing.",
