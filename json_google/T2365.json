  "description": "Social network analysis is a method of research using data to analyze relationships between individuals, organizations, etc. Driving social network analysis is the idea that social networks are fundamentally a part of any group or community. The people who know each other, and, in turn, know others present a web of power and knowledge. Theoretically, these connections and relationships speak volumes about our society and the individual players, or actors, themselves. Researchers, mainly in the social sciences, have studied these types of connections for decades attempting to give meaning to the social networks around us. Quite often they collect survey data and build databases for their analysis. Journalists have recently begun using social network analysis software and techniques to produce and investigate stories. While some of the stories may include fancy graphics of connections, other stories simply used social network analysis methods as a tipsheet, or guide, to further investigate a story. Social network analysis can help journalists sift through all of the noise of the extraneous information and attempt to focus on the individuals or organizations that are potentially pivotal to the story.",
