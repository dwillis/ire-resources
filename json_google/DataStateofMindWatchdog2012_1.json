  "description": "A guide for journalists on how to develop a data state of mind, which is the mindset that you are going to quantify or measure something, rather than just getting the facts and all sides of the story. This requires that you analyze some data on your own, making you less dependent on public officials to give you the straight story and oftentimes giving you a story that wouldn't have been possible without the analysis.",
