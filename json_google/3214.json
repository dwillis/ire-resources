  "description": "Following the collapse of an I-35 bridge spanning the Mississippi River in Minneapolis, journalists, including Dan Browning and MaryJo Webster, turned to the National Bridge Inventory database, available from IRE and NICAR, to check the bridge's inspection history. The Start Tribune and The Pioneer Press reported that inspection data from 2005 showed that the Minnesota Department of Transportation deemed the bridge “structurally deficient.” The Pioneer Press also noted a federal reporting finding that Minnesota had 3 percent of its bridges rated deficient in 2006.",
