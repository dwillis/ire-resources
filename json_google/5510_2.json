  "description": "The National Institute On Money In State Politics (FollowTheMoney.org) collects comprehensive state and federal political spending data and makes it freely available at FollowTheMoney.org. The 2018 state elections are on track to break $$$ records, with 275 executive offices in 43 states, 36 Governor Races, 74 Supreme Court races in 32 states, and 82% of legislative seats on ballots in 46 states. National players will be big spenders in the 2018 state races, and the outcomes will largely determine who holds the re-districting pen, following the 2020 Census. FollowTheMoney.org provides data on direct contributions to federal, state and select local campaigns, independent spending in federal and selected states, and state lobbying expenditures in selected states. The website also offers tools such as disclosure scorecards, competitiveness index, similarity index, My District, and My Legislature. FollowTheMoney.org is a valuable resource for anyone interested in tracking money in politics."
