Thank you for sharing your presentation, Michael. I found it to be very informative and helpful. I especially appreciated your tips on how to use databases and other computer-mined information to track trends in the military. I think this is a valuable skill for any reporter to have, and I will definitely be using your advice in my own work.

I also found your discussion of the military mindset to be very interesting. I think it is important for reporters to understand the way that the military thinks and operates in order to be able to cover it effectively. Your insights into the military mindset will definitely be helpful to me as I continue to cover this beat.
