  "description": "The Dallas Morning News studied a database of brokers' regulatory histories and discovered deep flaws in the NASD's system of reporting violations. The paper profiled a local broker who had filed for bankruptcy to avoid paying a widow the $225,000 arbitration award she had won against him (he's now paying her) and had failed to disclose three hot-check convictions and two current tax liens as required by regulators (they're now on his official record). The News also identified the firms in town whose brokers had the most black marks on their records.",
