  "description": "The 2000 Census reported far larger numbers of same-sex couples than the 1990 Census. Gay-rights advocacy groups say that same-sex couples are more comfortable about telling the census-takers who they are, but the Census Bureau belatedly weighed in with a technical note saying some of the difference (it did not say how much) was because the numbers were analyzed differently in 2000.",
