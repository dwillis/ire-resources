The Wall Street Journal reporters used a variety of sources to gather information about the companies that might have been formed by Trump attorney Michael Cohen to pay hush money to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. They obtained lists of new companies established in the time period they were looking for from different states, including Delaware, Nevada and Wyoming. They also did similar searches on opencorporates.com and in databases like TLO. With opencorporates, while it is free, you have more search options in terms of the number of records you can search and the filters you can use if you create a registration, which you can easily do by linking to a social media account like LinkedIn.

The reporters then asked the Delaware secretary of state's office to email them the incorporation documents that are on file. These documents aren't available online.

The reporters also looked for companies that might have the same address, or that might use the same registered agent or office of a registered agent, or in the same state -- basically look for commonalities with entities that are known to be associated with a particular person or company.

The reporters then took their findings back to their sources and asked more questions. This process allowed them to identify the company that Cohen used to make the hush money payment to Stormy Daniels.
