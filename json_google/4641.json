Here is a sample Rake task for loading data from a CSV file:

```
desc "load the data"
task :csv => :environment do
  require 'csv'

  # Open the CSV file
  csv_file = File.open('db/initial/schools.csv', 'r')

  # Create a new ActiveRecord::Base subclass for each row in the CSV file
  csv_reader = CSV.new(csv_file, headers: true) do |row|
    School.create(
      name: row[0],
      kind: row[1],
      students: row[2],
      teachers: row[3]
    )
  end
end
```

This task will create a new School record for each row in the CSV file, with the fields "name", "kind", "students", and "teachers".
