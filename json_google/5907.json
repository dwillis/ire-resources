  "description": "In an era when “Fake News” is part of the everyday lexicon and readers question the credibility of our work, transparency matters. This panel will explore practices that can build trust with readers, such as annotating stories; publishing source documents; revealing our funding sources and being up front with story subjects about what we’re investigating. We’ll explore tricky issues like how much to say about an investigation before it publishes and how to respond to concerns about accuracy and bias.",
