  "description": "Getting HTML tables into Microsoft Excel used to be labor intensive and problematic. You could go to the webpage, copy and paste the information, but this often caused problems with getting the data to line-up correct and embedded links which tried to connect to a webpage. Alternatively you could have downloaded the webpage, imported it, then cleared the formatting and then save it to an older version to get rid of the links. Fortunately, starting with Excel 2000, Microsoft has made importing HTML files easy.",
