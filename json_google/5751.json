Here is the code to split the address into six columns:

```python
import re

def split_address(address):
    """Splits the address into six columns: address, city, state, zip, latitude, and longitude."""
    regex = r"^" + r"(.*?)" + r"\n" + r"(.*?)" + r", (TX)" + r"(\d*)" + r"\n" + r"\((.*?)\)" + r", (.*?)$"
    groups = re.findall(regex, address)
    return groups

def main():
    # Get the address from the user.
    address = input("Enter the address: ")

    # Split the address into six columns.
    groups = split_address(address)

    # Print the six columns.
    print("Address:", groups[0])
    print("City:", groups[1])
    print("State:", groups[2])
    print("Zip:", groups[3])
    print("Latitude:", groups[4])
    print("Longitude:", groups[5])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
