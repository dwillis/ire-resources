  "description": "This presentation will discuss the findings of a WUSA9 investigation into the use of stop and frisk by the Washington, DC Police Department. The investigation found that African-Americans are disproportionately stopped by police, even though they make up a smaller percentage of the city's population. The presentation will also discuss the challenges of reporting on police practices and the importance of demanding accountability from law enforcement.",
