  "description": "This study examines a random sample of 1,455 entries in the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) contest from 1979 to 2012. The authors find that investigative reporting is most likely to be conducted by newspapers, that stories are most likely to be triggered by tips from sources, and that the most common subjects of investigative reporting are government and the private sector. The authors also find that investigative reporting is most likely to produce results when it is based on enterprise reporting, when it uses public records laws, and when it is covered by television news.",
