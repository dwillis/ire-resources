The id should be 5394. authors is a list containing individual elements with the following attributes: name, email and affiliation. Do NOT make up any names; leave the name null if none is listed. email and affiliation may be null, but if the text includes the name of a news organization, use that as the affiliation if none appears next to the author name.
