Thank you for sharing this tip sheet! It's very informative and helpful. I'm particularly interested in the section on field reporting. I've always wanted to do some investigative reporting on wildlife issues, and this gives me a lot of good ideas to get started.

I'm also interested in the section on investigative wildlife stories to check out for inspiration. I've read some of these stories before, but there are a few new ones that I'm excited to check out.

Thanks again for sharing this tip sheet!
