The following are the steps on how to create a hex bin layer in QGIS:

1. Install the MMQGIS plugin.
2. Create a new vector layer.
3. Set the layer type to "hexagon (polygon)".
4. Set the "H spacing" and "V spacing" to the desired values.
5. Click "OK".

The MMQGIS plugin will create a new layer with hexagonal bins. The size of the bins can be adjusted by changing the "H spacing" and "V spacing" values.

Here is a screenshot of a hex bin layer created using the MMQGIS plugin:



The hex bin layer can be used to visualize spatial data. For example, the layer can be used to show the distribution of earthquakes.
