  "description": "Agribusiness touches nearly all beats: labor, climate change, immigration, water, money, government policy, environment, ethanol, international trade. But is not always a well covered beat. This presentation will explore the challenges of investigating agribusiness, including complex systems, multiple agencies and oversights, billions of dollars, farm culture, international reach and impact, various barriers, and the handful of companies that control up to 90 percent of the world's grain trade. It will also discuss how to access data, build your own data, and follow the money.",
