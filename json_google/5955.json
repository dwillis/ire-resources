Thank you for sharing this helpful resource! I'm sure it will be a valuable tool for journalists who are covering the military.

I'm particularly interested in the following story ideas:

* The impact of the military on local communities. This could include stories about how military bases affect the economy, the environment, and the social fabric of a community.
* The challenges faced by veterans returning to civilian life. This could include stories about the difficulty of finding employment, housing, and healthcare, as well as the emotional toll of war.
* The role of women in the military. This could include stories about the challenges and opportunities facing female service members, as well as the changing nature of gender roles in the military.

I hope you'll continue to share your insights and expertise with the journalism community.
