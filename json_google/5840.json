Thank you for the presentation! I learned a lot about FOIA and how to use it to access government records. I'm particularly interested in the idea of using FOIA to investigate corruption and wrongdoing. I think it's a powerful tool that can be used to hold the government accountable.

I have a few questions:

1. How do you deal with agencies that are slow to respond to FOIA requests?
2. What are some tips for dealing with agencies that try to withhold records?
3. What are some of the biggest challenges you've faced in your work as a FOIA journalist?

Thank you again for the presentation!
