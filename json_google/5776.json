  "description": "Medical devices improve and save lives, but governments have allowed products on the market with little or no human testing that went on to cause great harm. Devices pulled off the market in some countries over safety concerns remain for sale in others. The device industry, and the regulators that oversee it struggle to quickly identify hazardous implants after they are released, leaving patients exposed. More than 1.7 million injuries and nearly 83,000 deaths to medical devices in reports to U.S. regulators over the last decade. Data can help explore the story systematically. Machine learning can help explore millions of records in a different way. Recalls can be evidence of a serious problem, but not all recalls are equal. Medical literature can identify alarming trends that don’t attract wide notice. Lawsuits can also point the way.",
