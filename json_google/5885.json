Thank you for sharing these great ideas, Amy and Nydia! I'm sure they will be very helpful to our members.

I would like to add a few more ideas to the list:

* **Investigate the high cost of prescription drugs.** This is a topic that is of great interest to many consumers, and there are many angles that you could explore. For example, you could investigate the reasons why prescription drugs are so expensive in the United States, or you could look into the impact that high drug prices are having on patients and their families.
* **Investigate the use of hidden fees by businesses.** Hidden fees are a common problem that can add up to a lot of money over time. You could investigate the use of hidden fees by businesses in a variety of industries, such as the travel industry, the healthcare industry, and the financial services industry.
* **Investigate the quality of products and services that are sold online.** With the rise of online shopping, it is more important than ever to be aware of the potential for scams and fraud. You could investigate the quality of products and services that are sold online, and you could also look into the practices of online retailers.
* **Investigate the impact of new technologies on consumers.** New technologies are constantly emerging, and it is important to understand the potential impact that they can have on consumers. For example, you could investigate the impact of social media on mental health, or you could look into the impact of artificial intelligence on the job market.

I hope these ideas are helpful!
