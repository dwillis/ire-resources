The article discusses the high cost of incarceration in Virginia. It argues that the state's get-tough policies have diverted hundreds of millions in state funds to build prisons, constricting the state's ability to reduce traffic gridlock and move its schoolchildren from trailers to classrooms. Prison spending is growing twice as fast as spending for colleges and universities. It costs Virginia taxpayers nearly $22,000 to imprison one inmate for a year -- more than twice the cost of tuition, room and board at a state university. It costs up to three times that much to keep the growing number of older prisoners locked up, further escalating the state's prison bill, which soon will reach $1 billion a year.

The article also discusses the racial disparities in the criminal justice system. It notes that African-Americans are arrested, prosecuted, convicted and imprisoned on drug charges in numbers vastly out of proportion to their use of illegal drugs. Although Virginia's population is three-quarters white, its prison population is two-thirds black. Black Virginians are seven times more likely to be locked up than whites, according to U.S. Justice Department data.

The article concludes by arguing that Virginia's get-tough policies have been off target, unnecessary and a colossal waste of money. Funding that could have gone toward improving Virginia schools and roads has been poured into unneeded prisons, they say. Even some who supported Allen's plan, like Del. Clifton Woodrum, D-Roanoke, are troubled by misgivings five years later.

"It's ironic," Woodrum said. "We're now in the position where we have an
excess of prison cells but a deficit of classroom space. We have people being
educated in trailers. I think somehow we've had our priorities get out of
whack."
