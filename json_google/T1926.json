  "description": "When trying to help reporters dodge subpoenas, many lawyers begin their argument to the judge with the words, “We are not an arm of law enforcement.” Police have a well-defined role in society: catch the crooks. Journalists have a separate role that’s equally well-defined: report the news. But when these roles become blurred, even to get a really good story, a host of legal complications arise. Escorting police onto private property, taking pictures, and agreeing to turn over the material may make the station an active participant in the arrest or search. Once along for that ride, it will be hard for the journalist to convince a judge that she was just covering the story. Consider the following: judges issue warrants that let the police enter private property to make an arrest or a search. Reporters cannot get warrants. The Supreme Court has held, in a case involving a network news story, that law enforcement officials went beyond the bounds of their warrant – and violated a Montana property owner’s constitutional right of privacy – when they brought journalists onto his property to conduct a search. usually, only the government, and not the press, can be held liable for a violation of someone’s constitutional rights. But in the same Montana story, the journalists agreed to let prosecutors control the airdate. Agents in turn agreed to wear a wire, let journalists attend planning meetings, and bring the news team onto the property. In the owner's suit against the network, the courts held this cooperation made the network a “state actor” capable of being sued, alongside the officers, for any violations of the property owner’s civil rights. by contrast, another court held last year that merely being tipped off by police about the location of a search did not make a broadcaster a "state actor" for civil rights purposes. in the wake of these rulings, some law enforcement agencies are now asking journalists to sign releases, indemnifying the agency from any legal fees for claims brought as a result their decision to invite the journalists along. finally, it is virtually a sure bet that where journalists have made a deal to act as the photographers for law enforcement, they waived their rights under state or federal law not to turn over all their material and to testify about their activities. They have made themselves, in effect, “an arm of law enforcement.” In reaching accommodations with police, newsroom managers need to give serious thought to both the importance of the story and the consequences for future legal issues.",
