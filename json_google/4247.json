  "description": "A 990 is an annual tax return that must be filed each year with the IRS by tax-exempt, non-profit organizations. The Fiesta Bowl is a non-profit organization that runs a college football bowl game. In 2011, a reporter looked at the Fiesta Bowl's 990s and found that the bowl was spending a lot of money on things like lobbyists and golf trips. The reporter's story led to a state and federal criminal investigation, and the Fiesta Bowl's CEO was eventually sent to prison.",
