  "description": "Nonprofits are a great unexplored area of coverage at most media operations. They also are a great resource for teaching student reporters the basics of using financial records and governmental documents to pierce the veil of secrecy that private groups work behind. Unlike private businesses, nonprofits do have to file a public income tax return and this can be a great starting point in the teaching process.",
