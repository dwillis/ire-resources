  "description": "Investigative findings and visual potential often have an inverse relationship â€“ the better the findings, the weaker the visuals. So how to avoid a sea of gray? For starters, teamwork: everyone shares responsibility for the presentation. Photographers and reporters are a natural team, but add on the graphic artists, the designer/layout person and the Web designer. They are present and invested at the first project meeting and continue to sweat the details with you all the way through proofing the pages and Web elements.",
