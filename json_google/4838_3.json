The Post's investigation into the addiction treatment industry in Palm Beach County has uncovered a web of corruption and abuse. The investigation found that some sober homes and treatment centers are charging exorbitant rates for urine tests, and that some are even using the tests to extort money from addicts. The investigation also found that some sober homes are operating without a license, and that some are providing substandard care. The Post's investigation has led to calls for increased regulation of the addiction treatment industry in Palm Beach County.
