  "title": "Investigative TV - more than hidden camera",
  "description": "Investigative programmes are seen on television screens almost everywhere. Investigative journalism is television whose credibility depends increasingly on showing, rather than telling. How has the demand for pictures changed the way investigative television works and the topics it covers? Especially when many of the present-day issues, like finance, economics, globalization, are challenging to turn into a compelling TV-story. We see excerpts showing different aspects of investigative television journalism: hidden camera and undercover reporting, use of fiction recreations i.a., structural analyses, and, last but not least, humour in investigative journalism. The session gives no solutions but hopefully acts as a springboard for a refreshing and lively debate on what should and can be done on television.",
