  "description": "The very first data to come out from Census 2000 is formally called PL 94-171 data because that's the 1975 law that requires it: Public Law 94-171. More commonly, it's called redistricting data because that's why it's made: To let state legislatures redraw congressional and state legislative boundaries. The law was an amendment to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and it reflected both the law's concern for minority representation and a series of 1960s Supreme Count decisions enshrining the one-man, one vote principle.",
