Sure, here is a JSON object based on the contents of the text:

```json

      "email": "jdemma@sun-sentinel.com",
      "affiliation": "Sun Sentinel"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2008",

  "description": "A guide to editing CAR stories, including tips on presentation, teamwork, and putting faces on the numbers.",
