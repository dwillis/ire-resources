This is a very comprehensive and well-written guide to using PSPP for basic statistics. I especially appreciate the clear explanations of the concepts and the step-by-step instructions. This will be a valuable resource for journalists who need to analyze data.

One suggestion for improvement would be to include more examples of how to use PSPP to analyze different types of data. For example, you could include a section on how to use PSPP to analyze survey data or to conduct a regression analysis.

Overall, this is an excellent guide that will be very helpful to journalists who need to use PSPP for basic statistics.
