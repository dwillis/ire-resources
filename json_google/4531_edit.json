  "description": "When transforming data analysis into storytelling, start with one premise: You’re writing a story with all the dimension of a narrative, including plot, emotion and characters. You can scale back as you write, but it’s important that you approach your piece with a story in mind -- not a government report. Databases, spreadsheets, and statistics are tools. They enable reporters to determine whether hunches are correct, and measure the breadth of a problem. But journalism is about people. And statistics, without any discussion of the people they represent, are bones without muscle, skin, and connective tissue.",
