  "description": "The Philadelphia Inquirer used extensive computer-assisted reporting to study three years of Philadelphia criminal court cases. In all, the paper analyzed 31,000 criminal cases involving more than 250,000 individual charges. It found a justice system with the nationâ€™s worst felony conviction rate, violent crime rates far above the national average, widespread witness intimidation, a billion dollars in uncollected bail and thousands of fugitives at large.",
