  "description": "Doctors are ordering expensive drug tests for seniors for which Medicare pays the bill. This is a result of the war on painkiller addiction. Medical guidelines encourage doctors who treat pain to test patients to make sure they are not abusing drugs or selling them. But some doctors are ordering tests for drugs that few seniors use, and billing Medicare separately for each drug. This has led to a surge in Medicare spending on drug tests, which has increased by more than 1,400% in five years.",
