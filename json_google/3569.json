  "description": "A ProPublica investigation found that the global bluefin tuna trade is riddled with fraud, negligence, and criminal misconduct. Fishermen blatantly violated quotas, officials colluded with industry, and sea ranches were epicenters for laundering tuna. The investigation led to coverage in more than 400 outlets, blogs and websites in 14 languages, and forced French officials to respond to allegations of doctoring numbers.",
