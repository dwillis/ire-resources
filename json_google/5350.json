Thank you for this comprehensive list of data sources on the opioid epidemic. This is a valuable resource for journalists and others who are working to understand and address this public health crisis.

I would add a few additional resources to this list:

* The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) has a website with a wealth of information on the opioid epidemic, including data, research, and resources for treatment and prevention.
* The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also has a website with data and resources on the opioid epidemic.
* The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has a website with data and resources on the opioid epidemic, including information on treatment and prevention.
* The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has a website with data and resources on the opioid epidemic, including information on law enforcement efforts.

I hope this information is helpful.
