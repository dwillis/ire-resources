Thank you for the exercise. It was very helpful to learn how to import and clean data in Access. I found the following tips particularly helpful:

* Use the Text Qualifier to ensure that commas are not misinterpreted as field separators.
* Use the INSTR function to find the position of a particular character in a field.
* Use the MID function to extract a substring from a field.
* Use the LEFT function to extract the leftmost characters from a field.
* Use the RIGHT function to extract the rightmost characters from a field.
* Use the ORDER BY clause to sort the results of a query.
* Use the WHERE clause to filter the results of a query.
* Use the LIKE operator to match a pattern in a field.

I am looking forward to using these skills in my future data analysis projects.
