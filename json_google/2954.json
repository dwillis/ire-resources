  "description": "The Chicago Tribune conducted one of the most comprehensive studies of mercury in commercial seafood. Reporters bought 162 samples of fish from randomly selected supermarkets in the Chicago area. Rutgers University tested the samples for mercury, a toxic metal that can cause learning disabilities in children and neurological problems in adults. The results kicked off a three-day series titled “Mercury Menace,” published Dec. 11-13, 2005. The series showed that mercury contamination in supermarket seafood is far more pervasive than what authorities have disclosed. Among the reaction: The FDA began an investigation into canned tuna; the USDA corrected its highly touted food pyramid; the state of Illinois passed dramatic cuts in mercury emissions, and the Canadian fishing industry announced that, for the first time, it would conduct widespread testing of fish caught in the Great Lakes and sold in U.S. supermarkets.",
