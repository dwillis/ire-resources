  "description": "The seemingly increased prevalence of catastrophic events, from natural disasters, biological threats, large-scale industrial accidents to infrastructure failure and terrorism, has created many challenges for journalists. Beyond the obvious stories focused on the immediate drama of a massive storm, the threat of Zika virus or the fatalities of a mass shooting, there are deeper issues that need to be explored by the press. These are the investigative reports that will help policy makers and the public understand critical underlying factors, clarifying what happened and what should be done in the future. Currently, too many questions go unanswered â€¦ even unasked. Perhaps during the critical elections of 2016, some of these issues should be addressed by candidates running for public office.",
