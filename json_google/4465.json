I have read your paper and I find it to be well-written and informative. You have done a good job of summarizing the history of manned flight and photography, as well as the current state of sUAS use for newsgathering. I also appreciate your discussion of the FAA's policies and regulations regarding sUAS, as well as the legal challenges that have been brought against the agency.

I have a few comments and questions that I hope you will consider. First, I think it would be helpful to provide more information about the survey that you conducted. How many people responded? What were their demographics? What were the most common uses for sUAS that were reported?

Second, I think it would be helpful to discuss the privacy implications of sUAS use in more detail. You mention that some people have expressed concerns about the use of sUAS to capture images of people without their consent. However, you do not provide any specific examples of how this might have happened or what the consequences might be.

Finally, I think it would be helpful to discuss the future of sUAS use for newsgathering. You mention that the FAA is currently working on rules to govern the commercial use of sUAS. However, you do not speculate on when these rules might be finalized or what their impact might be on newsgathering.

Overall, I think this is a well-written and informative paper. I appreciate your efforts to explore the complex issues surrounding the use of sUAS for newsgathering.
