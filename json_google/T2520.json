The idea machine is a tool that can be used to generate ideas for investigative stories. It is a process that involves brainstorming, research, and analysis. The first step is to brainstorm a list of potential topics. This can be done by thinking about issues that are important to your community, or by looking at national or international news. Once you have a list of topics, you need to do some research to see if there is enough information available to support an investigation. You can do this by searching online databases, reading newspapers and magazines, and talking to experts. If you find that there is enough information, you can start to analyze it to see if there is a story there. This may involve looking for patterns, trends, or inconsistencies. Once you have a good idea of what the story is, you can start to develop a plan for how to investigate it. This may involve interviewing people, gathering documents, or conducting experiments. The idea machine is a powerful tool that can help you to find stories that matter. It is a process that requires time and effort, but it is worth it to produce high-quality investigative journalism.

Here are some examples of investigative stories that have been published in recent years:
