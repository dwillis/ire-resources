Here are some additional tips for doing CAR for TV:

* **Be visual.** TV is a visual medium, so make sure your stories are visually appealing. Use maps, charts, and graphs to illustrate your data. You can also use video to show the people and places you're talking about.
* **Tell a story.** People are more likely to remember stories than facts. When you're reporting on data, try to tell a story that will engage your audience.
* **Be clear and concise.** TV is a fast-paced medium, so you don't have a lot of time to explain your data. Make sure your points are clear and concise.
* **Be accurate.** When you're reporting on data, it's important to be accurate. Double-check your numbers and make sure you're using the right terms.
* **Be fair.** When you're reporting on data, it's important to be fair. Don't cherry-pick data to support your point of view. Present all sides of the story.
* **Be transparent.** Let your audience know where your data comes from. If you're using data from a government agency, for example, say so.
* **Be ethical.** When you're reporting on data, it's important to be ethical. Don't misrepresent the data or use it to mislead your audience.

I hope these tips help you get started with CAR for TV.
