  "description": "Asia has a booming media market, brought about by increasing prosperity, the rise of the middle class and growing public demand for news and information. China and India are today the largest newspaper markets in the world and newspaper circulation in these and several other Asian countries continues to grow, defying global trends. Television, radio and the Web are enjoying unprecedented audiences as well. There are tremendous opportunities for journalistic networking in Asia. It is certainly a growth area for investigative reporting, which is taking place in both big and small media, mainstream news outlets, as well as citizen journalist sites. Some outstanding examples include the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism (PCIJ), the Nepali Center for Investigative Reporting (KPK), Tehelka (India), Malaysiakini, Caijing Review (China), Newsbreak (Philippines), Tempo (Indonesia), Irrawaddy (Burma/Thailand), Probe Productions (Philippines), News Probe (CCTV, China), 68 H (Indonesia), and Ohmynews (South Korea).",
