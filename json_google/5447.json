Chapter 3: Hello template

Navigate back to localhost:3000 in your browser. You should see the same default homepage as before.

Its contents is configured in the index.nunjucks file found in the directory Yeoman created. It uses a templating
language for JavaScript invented at Mozilla called Nunjucks.

You can edit the page by opening it in your text editor. Change the text to say "Hello, world!" and save the file.

Now, when you refresh the page in your browser, you should see the new text.

Congratulations, you've just created your first Nunjucks template!

Let's take a closer look at how Nunjucks works. The index.nunjucks file contains a series of variables that are
defined using the {{ }} syntax. For example, the following line defines a variable called `name` with the
value "John Doe":

```
{{ name }}
```

You can then use this variable in your template. For example, the following line will output the text "Hello, John Doe":

```
Hello, {{ name }}!
```

Nunjucks also supports a number of other features, such as loops, conditionals, and filters. For more information,
please see the Nunjucks documentation.

Now that you know the basics of Nunjucks, let's start building our graphics app.
