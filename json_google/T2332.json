This is a great list of resources for sports journalists. I would add a few more:

* The NCAA publishes a lot of data on its website, including information on athlete demographics, graduation rates, and financial aid.
* The Bureau of Labor Statistics also publishes data on sports occupations, including salaries and job outlook.
* The Sports Business Journal is a great source for news and analysis on the business of sports.
* The website ProPublica has done some excellent reporting on sports-related issues, such as concussions and doping.

I hope this is helpful!
