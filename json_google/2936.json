  "description": "This report analyzes the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) under the Bush administration. It finds that the administration has made it more difficult for the public to access government information, through a variety of means, including reducing the number of FOIA requests processed, increasing the number of denials, and using secrecy to shield its activities from public scrutiny.",
