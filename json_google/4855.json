  "description": "The First Amendment does not serve as a blanket immunization of journalists – or their sources – acting in the newsgathering process. Fact-dependent analysis, with limited legal precedent. U.S. Supreme Court has not given a categorical answer whether truthful publication may be punished consistent with the First Amendment. Criminal and civil liability as to both the journalist and the source has the potential to chill newsgathering activities.",
