This is a great tip sheet! I'm sure it will be very helpful to journalists who are covering campaign finance and money in politics.

One thing I would add is that it's important to be aware of the different types of campaign finance data that are available. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) website has a wealth of information on campaign contributions and expenditures, but it can be a bit overwhelming to navigate. There are also a number of non-profit organizations that track campaign finance data, such as the Center for Responsive Politics and OpenSecrets.org. These organizations can provide helpful analysis and context for the data.

Another thing to keep in mind is that campaign finance data is just one piece of the puzzle. It's important to also look at other factors, such as lobbying data and personal financial disclosure forms, to get a complete picture of how money influences politics.

Thanks for sharing this tip sheet!
