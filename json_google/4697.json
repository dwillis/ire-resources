This is a great presentation on how to use Tableau to analyze data. I found it to be very informative and helpful. I especially appreciated the step-by-step instructions on how to load data, create calculations, and export results. I would definitely recommend this presentation to anyone who is interested in learning how to use Tableau.

Here are a few additional things that I found helpful:

* The use of screenshots to illustrate the steps being described. This made it easy to follow along and understand what was being done.
* The inclusion of tips and tricks, such as how to save time by creating calculated fields and how to export results in a variety of formats.
* The overall tone of the presentation, which was clear, concise, and easy to understand.
