  "description": "The courtrooms in Colorado went dark for three days in September while judges attended a conference in Vail. Our hidden cameras captured judges turning the judicial education into a taxpayer funded vacation. In addition to not attending, we found judges who falsified legal affidavits certifying they attended classes when our cameras showed them hiking and playing golf. Following our investigation, the Colorado Supreme Court reconsidered its decision to host the conference at an upscale mountain resort and has decided relocate to future conferences to Denver.",
