  "description": "The governmental shift toward secrecy has not bypassed our state and federal courts systems. In the last few years, reporters have encountered increasing numbers of anonymous juries; dealt with creative judges finding interesting ways to justify sealing court proceedings and files and uncovered disturbing trends of secret dockets — entire court cases being filed and tried outside the public’s view. The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, a national legal defense and advocacy organization for journalists, tracks court access issues of interest to the media through news updates on its site, www.rcfp.org. These issues are covered further in depth in the Reporters Committee’s quarterly magazine, The News Media and the Law. Additionally, regular special reports give reporters a statement of the law in each state on a particular issue and provide tips on how to address difficulties that might arise when gathering news in that context. Our Secret Justice guides — summarized below — are available online and are a great resource for various court access issues. The Reporters Committee provides free legal assistance to journalists facing court access issues — or any other legal issue — through our 24-hour legal defense hotline 1-800-336-4243.",
