  "description": "This paper explores the structure and funding of investigative reporting associations. It discusses the various roles these groups fulfill, such as giving out awards, publishing guidebooks, holding regional, national, and international conferences, running workshops and teaching, and lobbying to support endangered journalists and freedom of the press. It also discusses the different income sources for these groups, such as membership fees, foundation grants, university funding, corporate funding, government funding, individual donations, sales and services, and endowments.",
