  "description": "The criminal justice beat can be one of the most data-rich beats in a newsroom. Information is stored electronically at all stages of the legal process -- from arrest to sentencing to imprisonment. That’s the good news. The bad news is that journalists in pursuit of a specific story often find the data trail fragmented among different criminal justice agencies and jurisdictions. And the data stored by these different agencies often don’t speak well to one another. This handout should give you an idea of where to start asking for data. If you intend to dig deep on a criminal justice story, brace yourself for the possibility that the story won’t be doable with data alone. Expect to spend some time in musty court morgues pulling files to verify that your database queries are yielding valid results or to plug holes because information is missing from the data files.",
