  "description": "ClearHealthCosts is a non-profit organization that aims to make health care prices more transparent. They do this by surveying providers on prices to pre-populate their database, using government data to show what Medicare pays for a given procedure, and putting their interactive widget on partners' sites. They also ask people to share their own health care costs, which helps to build a more complete picture of the market. ClearHealthCosts has been praised for their work, which has helped to change the conversation about health care costs and led to legislation being passed in some states.",
