Here are some tips on how to find stories in government contracting data:

1. **Start with the basics.** The Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) is a great place to start your research. It contains information on all federal contracts over $25,000, including the name of the contractor, the amount of the contract, and the agency that awarded it. You can search the FPDS by keyword, agency, or contract number.
2. **Look for patterns.** Once you've identified some interesting contracts, take a look at the data to see if there are any patterns. For example, are there certain companies that seem to be getting a lot of contracts from a particular agency? Or are there certain types of contracts that are being awarded more frequently than others?
3. **Follow the money.** Once you've identified a potential story, take a look at the contractor's financial records. You can find this information on the Securities and Exchange Commission's website (SEC). The SEC requires public companies to file annual reports, which include information on their revenues, expenses, and profits.
4. **Talk to the people involved.** The best way to understand a government contract is to talk to the people who are involved in it. This includes the contractor, the agency that awarded the contract, and any other stakeholders. These interviews can help you to understand the motivations behind the contract, as well as the potential risks and benefits.
5. **Be patient.** Government contracting is a complex process, and it can take time to understand all of the nuances. Don't be afraid to ask questions and to keep digging until you've found the story you're looking for.
