The Naval Aviation Safety Database is a valuable resource for researchers and journalists who want to understand the causes of aviation accidents. The database contains information on more than 48,000 "reportable events" since Jan 1, 1980, ranging from minor no-cost, nodamage problems to loss of aircraft and crew. None of the conclusionary narrative fields are included. The short summary included has no conclusions. There are no names or personal identifiers. Aircraft tailnumbers are included and allow identifying multiple events for the same aircraft.

The database is organized into 97 data tables with 807 variables. But data was suppressed in 218 fields because of privacy and national security.

There are three primary key fields â€“ events, persons and planes, plus several subsidiary key fields for some detail tables.

To use the database, you first need to join the tables together. This can be done using a variety of methods, such as the SQL JOIN command. Once the tables are joined, you can then query the data to answer your questions.

For example, if you want to know how many crashes involve engine problems, you would first join the AV_RPRTBL_EVENT table to the AV_ENG_CMPNT table. Then, you would use the EVENT_SEVTY_C field to select only events that were classified as crashes. Finally, you would use the IMC_C field to select only events that involved engine problems.

The results of this query would show you how many crashes involved engine problems. You could then use this information to identify trends and make recommendations for safety improvements.
