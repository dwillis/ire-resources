Continue the fight against private email, private text messages, and self-deleting forms of communication by public officials. 2. Establish First Amendment right of access to police shooting videos on public streets in states with restrictive FOIA laws. 3. Sanction the FBI for its repeated bad faith and dishonesty in FOIA responses and before the courts. 4. Establish the statutory requirement of “prompt” production of records as 90 days except in rare and extreme circumstances. 5. Let no FOIA denial or untimely response go unchallenged in court, regardless of ability to pay attorney fees.",
