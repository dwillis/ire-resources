This is a great introduction to generalized estimating equations (GEE). GEE is a powerful tool for modeling longitudinal data, and it is relatively easy to use in R. I particularly appreciate the way you have explained the concepts in a clear and concise way, and the examples are very helpful. Thank you for sharing this!
