  "description": "This paper examines the rise of Pim Fortuyn in the Netherlands, and the shift in voter sentiment that led to his success. It argues that Fortuyn's appeal was based on a blend of left- and right-wing policies, and that he was able to connect with voters who were disillusioned with the traditional political parties.",
