The following are some of the most notable investigative journalism stories from the past decade:

The Panama Papers investigation led to the resignation of several politicians and the seizure of millions of dollars in assets.
* The Paradise Papers: In 2017, the ICIJ published another trove of leaked documents, this time from the offshore law firm Appleby. The Paradise Papers investigation revealed the hidden offshore assets of even more world leaders, politicians, celebrities, and other high-profile individuals. The Paradise Papers investigation led to the resignation of several politicians and the seizure of millions of dollars in assets.
* The Russia investigation: In 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice launched an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The investigation, led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, uncovered a wide-ranging conspiracy by Russia to interfere in the election and to help Donald Trump win. The Russia investigation led to the indictment of dozens of individuals, including several Trump associates, and to the conviction of several others.
* The #MeToo movement: In 2017, the #MeToo movement began to gain momentum.
