  "description": "Communities large and small have nonprofits for everything from affordable housing to development. Many of them do good work, but some don’t follow all the rules. Because nonprofits registered with the federal government don’t pay taxes, they must follow rules about who can benefit from their tax-free money. If they don’t, they can face penalties and lots of bad press. With a little sleuthing, reporters can uncover the bad apples and tell donors where their money really goes.",
