  "description": "This presentation will provide tips on how to conduct watchdog investigations, including how to follow the stimulus, check out your Congressman, look at what they are spending line item by line item, particularly discretionary spending, ask to view the records, not for copies, this will save you big bucks. Bring a scanner or a laptop, create a spreadsheet and enter material on your own. Donâ€™t ignore the obvious, look at what they are buying, look at what they are building, examine the expenses, especially at financially strapped public institutions that are asking taxpayers to dig further into their pockets.",
