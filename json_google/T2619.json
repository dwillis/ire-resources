  "description": "Social network analysis is a method of research using data to analyze relationships between individuals, organizations, etc. Driving social network analysis is the idea that social networks are fundamentally a part of any group or community. The people who know each other, and, in turn, know others present a web of power and knowledge. Theoretically, these connections and relationships speak volumes about our society and the individual players, or actors, themselves.",
