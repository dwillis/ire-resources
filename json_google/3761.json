Thank you for sharing this information. It is very helpful to have a clear understanding of how
public pension plans work and how to assess their health. I will keep these tips in mind as I
cover my local pension plan.

I have a few questions:

1. What are some of the red flags that you would look for when assessing a pension plan's health?
2. What are some of the ways that public pension plans have been trying to address their funding shortfalls?
3. What are the potential consequences for taxpayers if public pension plans are not adequately funded?

Thank you again for your time and expertise.
