The following are some Internet forensic tools that can be used to investigate online fraud:

* **DomainTools:** DomainTools is a website that provides information about domain names, including who owns them, when they were registered, and where they are hosted. This information can be used to track down the owners of fraudulent websites.
* **Whois:** Whois is a database that contains information about domain names, including the name of the registrant, the address of the registrant, and the contact information for the registrant. This information can be used to contact the owners of fraudulent websites and ask them to remove the websites.
* **Wayback Machine:** The Wayback Machine is a website that archives websites. This information can be used to see what a website looked like in the past, which can be helpful in investigating online fraud.
* **Google Search:** Google Search is a search engine that can be used to find information about websites. This information can be used to find out more about fraudulent websites, such as who owns them and what they are selling.
* **Social Media:** Social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram can be used to find information about fraudulent websites. This information can be used to find out more about the owners of the websites and the people who are promoting them.
* **Internet Service Providers (ISPs):** ISPs are companies that provide Internet access to individuals and businesses. ISPs can be contacted to ask them to block access to fraudulent websites.
* **Law Enforcement:** Law enforcement agencies can be contacted to investigate online fraud. Law enforcement agencies have the power to subpoena information from websites and ISPs, and they can also arrest people who are involved in online fraud.

It is important to note that online fraud is a complex issue, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. The best way to investigate online fraud will vary depending on the specific circumstances of each case.
