Here is a story that uses some of the Excel functions and tricks that I have described:

The police chief was looking at the salary data for the St. Paul police department. He had just announced that everyone was getting a 1% raise, but all with get a minimum raise of $350 (if 1% of their salary is less than $350).

He wanted to see how the raises would affect the overall salary budget. He opened up a new spreadsheet and started by entering the salary data for each officer. Then, he used an IF statement to calculate the new salary for each officer. The IF statement looked at the officer's current salary and the 1% raise. If the 1% raise was greater than $350, then the new salary was equal to the current salary plus the 1% raise. If the 1% raise was less than $350, then the new salary was equal to the current salary plus $350.

The chief then used a SUM function to calculate the total salary budget for the new salaries. He was pleased to see that the total salary budget would only increase by a small amount. He was also pleased that all of the officers would be getting a raise, even if it was a small one.

The chief then printed out the spreadsheet and took it to the city council meeting. He explained the situation to the council members and showed them the spreadsheet. The council members were impressed with the chief's work and they approved the new salaries.

The officers were happy with the raises and they thanked the chief for his efforts. The chief was happy that he was able to help the officers and he was glad that the city council was supportive of his decision.
