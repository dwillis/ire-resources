  "description": "This is a brief introduction to Farsight DNSDB® for investigative reporters. The Domain Name System (DNS) is the infrastructure of the Internet. As a result, almost every action online leaves a digital trail of DNS assets. Persons or Entities of Interest often will use multiple domains and websites to remain undetected or mask the scope of their digital footprint. They may also share or reuse DNS assets i.e. same IP address, same Netblock, or Nameservers By searching – or querying -- a specific domain name or IP address using a historical Passive DNS database, investigative reporters can identify subtle relationships among other DNS assets, from IP addresses to domain names to mail to file to web servers. This information can be used to confirm existing evidence or provide new insights for a story. Using Farsight DNSDB® reporters can: Confirm a Breaking News Story Advance a Broadly-Covered Media Report Uncover Latent Relationships among Domain Names, IP Addresses, Other Infrastructure Gain Evidence to Evaluate the Objective Credibility of Sources",
