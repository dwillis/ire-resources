

Not only can you use Google to look for images once you've
started a regular Google search, you can also do a reverse image search



When on the Google Images page, click on the camera icon in the search bar and upload an image or paste the URL of an image you want to search for.



Google will then show you a list of similar images, as well as websites where the image has been used.



This can be a helpful tool for journalists who are trying to verify the authenticity of an image or find out more information about a particular event.



For example, if you're reporting on a protest, you could use a reverse image search to find out if the images you're using are actually from the protest you're reporting on.



You could also use it to find out more information about the people in the images, or to find out more about the event itself.



Reverse image search is a powerful tool that can be used by journalists to verify information, find out more about a particular topic, or even to find new stories.
