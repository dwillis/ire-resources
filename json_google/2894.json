I think this is a great handout on how to conduct an interview. It covers a lot of important topics, such as preparation, research, and how to deal with reluctant people. I especially like the section on "Getting All the Goods," which provides some helpful tips on how to get the most out of an interview.

One thing I would add is that it's important to be respectful of the person you're interviewing. Remember that they are giving you their time and their story, so be sure to treat them with courtesy and professionalism.

Overall, I think this is a very helpful handout that would be beneficial for anyone who wants to learn how to conduct a good interview.
