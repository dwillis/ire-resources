Here are some tips on how to handle denials of public records requests:

* **Ask for an explanation.** If an agency denies your request, ask for a written explanation of the reasons for the denial. The explanation should cite the specific statutory exemption(s) upon which the agency is relying.
* **Review the law.** Make sure you understand the open records law in your state. The law may specify certain procedures that the agency must follow, such as providing you with a copy of the denial letter and giving you an opportunity to appeal.
* **Appeal the denial.** If you are not satisfied with the agency's explanation, you can appeal the denial. The appeal process will vary depending on the state law. In some states, you may be able to appeal to the agency's own appeals board. In other states, you may have to file a lawsuit in court.
* **File a lawsuit.** If you are unsuccessful in your appeal, you may be able to file a lawsuit in court. A lawsuit is a costly and time-consuming process, but it may be necessary to obtain the records you are seeking.

It is important to remember that you have the right to access public records. If an agency denies your request, you should not hesitate to ask for an explanation and to appeal the denial.
