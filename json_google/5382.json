Here are some tips for early career journalists from the NICAR18 Early Career Straight-Talk Panel Mentors:

* **Be prepared to learn new things.** The field of journalism is constantly evolving, so it's important to be open to learning new skills and technologies.
* **Network with other journalists.** Attend conferences, join online communities, and reach out to people whose work you admire. Networking can help you learn about new opportunities and get your foot in the door.
* **Be persistent.** It can take time to find a job in journalism, so don't give up. Keep applying for jobs, even if you don't feel like you're qualified. The more you apply, the better your chances of getting hired.
* **Be passionate about your work.** Journalism is a demanding job, but it's also incredibly rewarding. If you're passionate about your work, it will show in your writing and reporting.

I hope these tips help you on your journey to becoming a successful journalist!
