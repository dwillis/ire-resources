This is a great list of resources for journalists who need to background businesses. I would add a few more:

* The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website has a wealth of information on public companies, including their financial statements, proxy statements, and other filings.
* The Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) website has information on workplace safety and health inspections, as well as data on workplace injuries and illnesses.
* The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) website has information on environmental permits and compliance, as well as data on air and water quality.
* The Better Business Bureau (BBB) website has information on businesses' customer service records and complaints.
* The National Association of State Boards of Accountancy (NASBA) website has information on state licensing requirements for accountants.
* The National Association of State Boards of Law Examiners (NASBLE) website has information on state licensing requirements for lawyers.

These are just a few of the many resources that are available to journalists who need to background businesses. By using these resources, journalists can get a more complete picture of a business's operations and history.
