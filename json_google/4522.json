There are a few different benchmarks that you can use to compare the interest rate on a municipal bond to the norm. One common benchmark is the U.S. Treasury yield curve, which shows the interest rates on U.S. Treasury bonds of different maturities. Another common benchmark is the Municipal Bond Index, which tracks the performance of a basket of municipal bonds.

When choosing a benchmark, it is important to consider the term of the bond you are looking at and the credit rating of the issuer. For example, if you are looking at a 10-year bond issued by a AAA-rated issuer, you might compare the interest rate on that bond to the 10-year Treasury yield. If you are looking at a 30-year bond issued by a BBB-rated issuer, you might compare the interest rate on that bond to the 30-year Municipal Bond Index.

It is also important to remember that benchmarks are just that: benchmarks. They are not perfect, and there will always be bonds that trade at a premium or discount to their benchmark. However, using benchmarks can help you to get a sense of whether the interest rate on a particular bond is reasonable.
