Thank you for your presentation, Bill Dedman. I found your suggestions for writing memorable investigative stories to be very helpful. I especially liked your point about being flexible in format. I think that is often overlooked, but it can really make a story stand out.

I also appreciated your story about Huguette Clark. It was a fascinating tale, and I learned a lot about her and her life. I think your presentation was very well-done, and I thank you for sharing your insights with us.
