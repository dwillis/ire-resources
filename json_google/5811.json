Chapter 3. Hello template

Navigate back to localhost:3000 in your browser. You should see the same default homepage as before.

Its contents is configured in the index.nunjucks file found in the directory Yeoman created. It uses a templating
language for JavaScript invented at Mozilla called Nunjucks.

You can edit the page by opening it in your text editor and changing the text inside the curly braces. For example,
you could change the headline to "Hello, world!" and the body text to "This is my first Nunjucks template."

When you're done editing, save the file and refresh your browser. You should see your changes reflected on the
page.

Congratulations, you've just created your first Nunjucks template!
