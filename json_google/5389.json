This is a great tipsheet! I've always been interested in campaign finance data, but I've never really known how to use it. This is a great resource for anyone who wants to learn more about how money influences politics.

I especially appreciate the section on "So Now What?" It's really helpful to have some specific ideas about what to look for when you're analyzing campaign finance data. I'm definitely going to use this tipsheet when I'm covering the midterm elections.

Thanks for sharing!
