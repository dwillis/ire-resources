Thank you for this helpful tipsheet! I'm particularly interested in the
data on unauthorized immigrants. I've always wondered how many there are in
the United States, and where they come from. It's good to know that Pew
Research Center has been tracking this data for many years.

I'm also interested in the data on foreign students. I'm a professor at a
university, and I'm always curious about where our students come from. It's
great to know that there are so many international students studying in the
United States.

Thank you again for this helpful tipsheet!
