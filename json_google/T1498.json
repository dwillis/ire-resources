I have found the following information about the electronic disclosure of state campaign finance and lobbying data:

* The National Association of State Election Officials (NASEO) maintains a website that provides links to the websites of state election offices. These websites typically include information about campaign finance and lobbying disclosure requirements.
* The National Institute on Money in State Politics (NIMSP) maintains a website that provides information about campaign finance and lobbying data for all 50 states. This information includes links to state websites, as well as data on campaign contributions, expenditures, and lobbyists.
* The Center for Responsive Politics (CRP) maintains a website that provides information about campaign finance and lobbying data for the federal government and for all 50 states. This information includes links to state websites, as well as data on campaign contributions, expenditures, and lobbyists.

I hope this information is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
