Here are some additional tips for consumer investigations:

* **Do your research.** Before you start investigating a company or product, make sure you know as much as you can about it. Read online reviews, talk to experts, and look for any red flags.
* **Be prepared to be persistent.** It can be difficult to get information from companies, especially if they're trying to hide something. Be prepared to follow up on leads and don't give up easily.
* **Be careful with your sources.** When you're investigating a company, it's important to be careful about who you trust. Make sure you only use credible sources and double-check your information.
* **Be ethical.** When you're investigating a company, it's important to be ethical. Don't do anything that could put yourself or your sources at risk.
* **Be patient.** Consumer investigations can take time. Don't expect to get results overnight. Be patient and keep working until you get the story.

Here are some examples of consumer investigations that have been successful:

* In 2015, ProPublica investigated the practice of for-profit colleges. They found that these colleges often prey on low-income students and leave them with large amounts of debt.
* In 2016, The New York Times investigated the practice of payday lending. They found that these loans are often predatory and can trap people in a cycle of debt.
* In 2017, The Washington Post investigated the practice of data collection. They found that companies are collecting vast amounts of data about people without their knowledge or consent.

These are just a few examples of the many consumer investigations that have been done in recent years. These investigations have helped to expose wrongdoing and protect consumers.
