  "description": "Muse is a research tool from Stanford Computer Science for browsing largescale archives. It was originally meant for people to browse their own long-term email archives. We have now started adapting it for journalists, archivists and researchers, who have a need to browse othersâ€™ long-term email archives. It is not yet commercial grade, but we would like input about features that would be useful to you. Please send us feedback!",
