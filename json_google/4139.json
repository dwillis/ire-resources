Sure, here is a JSON object based on the contents of the text:

```json
{
  "id": 4139,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Ken Armstrong",
      "email": "karmstrong@seattletimes.com",
      "affiliation": "The Seattle Times"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2019",
  "title": "Chasing Paper",
  "description": "Tips for journalists on how to request and obtain public records.",
  "keywords": ["public records", "FOIA", "journalism"]
}
```

I hope this is helpful!
