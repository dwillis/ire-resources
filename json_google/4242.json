  "description": "This presentation will discuss a ProPublica investigation into Medicare prescribing patterns. The investigation found that Medicare's failure to keep watch over Part D had enabled inappropriate and risky prescribing, billions of dollars in waste, and fraud to flourish. The presentation will also discuss the limitations of the data used in the investigation and the potential for other sources of prescribing data to be used to improve care and reduce costs.",
