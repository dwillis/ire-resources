Sure, here is a JSON object based on the contents of the text:

```json
{
  "id": 3439,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Mark Caramanica",
      "email": "mcaramanica@rcfp.org",
      "affiliation": "The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2010",
  "title": "FOIA Tip Sheet",
  "description": "A list of tips for journalists on how to use the Freedom of Information Act to obtain government records.",
  "keywords": ["FOIA", "Freedom of Information Act", "journalism", "government records"]
}
```

I hope this is helpful!
