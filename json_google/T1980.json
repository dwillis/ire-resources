  "description": "Public health is one of the richest, and often most unexplored, areas of reporting. Beyond the stories of heroic life-saving efforts or the latest strain of flu are mountains of public records that reveal devastating tales of negligence, medical mayhem and the effects of costcutting on patient care. These records can, with limitations, tell you if nurses at a local hospital care for too many patients, follow doctors’ orders or even meet basic competency standards. They can tell you if the floors are dirty or the medical records are in disarray or if a patient has been left to bleed to death in the lobby. They can help you show readers how a medical misstep unraveled a family’s life.",
