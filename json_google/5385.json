I'm glad you enjoyed the talk! I think it's important to be aware of the ways in which charts can be misleading, and to be critical of the information we see presented in them.

I'm also a big fan of Alberto Cairo's work. He's a great communicator, and he does a great job of explaining the principles of data visualization in a way that is both accessible and informative.
