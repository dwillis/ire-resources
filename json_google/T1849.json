  "description": "There are an estimated two million radioactive sources spread across the U.S. in hospitals, industrial sites and at universities. These sources have become an essential part of our lives. Physicians use them to provide medical treatments to their patients and construction workers use them to measure the thickness of pipes or walls. Yet, an estimated 500,000 of these sources are no longer needed or wanted by their owners. Lost, stolen or discarded radioactive sources are dubbed “orphans” and hundreds of them turn up on the street every year. Some of them end up in junkyards, often causing millions of dollars in economic damage as a result of extensive clean-up efforts that follow their discovery. The situation has become so widespread that many scrap yards have installed radiation detectors at their front gates. But what worries many security officials most is that some of these potentially lethal “orphaned” sources will turn up in the hands of terrorists.",
