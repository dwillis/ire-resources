  "title": "The American Fisherman",
  "description": "The American fisherman today faces many challenges well beyond those met at sea. Dwindling stocks and increasing regulations mean more time spent at the docks than on the water. Lawsuits and council meetings dominate talk at the local coffee shops. Gentrified waterfronts increasingly give way to condo, art studios, and T-shirt shops, leaving fishermen with no place to work. Foreign imports – often from nations with weaker environmental standards – drive down prices, leaving little or no profit margin. What’s the future hold for America’s fishermen? What will become of such famous fishing communities as Gloucester, Kodiak, and Newport? Will the family fisherman go the way of the family farmer?",
