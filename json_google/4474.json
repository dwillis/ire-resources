Sure, here is a JSON object based on the contents of the text:

```json

  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Nancy Stancill",
      "email": "nancy.stancill@gmail.com",
      "affiliation": "The News & Observer"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2023",
  "title": "Using Your Investigative Reporting in a Novel",
  "description": "In some ways, the investigative reporter is the perfect modern-day sleuth. Our work often centers on solving mysteries, shedding daylight on malfeasance and trying to find a happy ending for those who are wronged. Why not turn your story, or at least pieces of it, into a novel?",
  "keywords": ["investigative reporting", "novel", "fiction", "journalism", "writing"]
}
```

I hope this is helpful!
