Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) is a dataset from the United States Census Bureau that contains detailed information about individuals and households. It is created by combining the long form responses from the decennial census with information from administrative records. PUMS is used by researchers, journalists, and policymakers to study a variety of topics, including demographics, poverty, and economic inequality.

PUMS is available in two versions: 1% and 5%. The 1% sample contains data on approximately 1% of the population, while the 5% sample contains data on approximately 5% of the population. The 1% sample is more detailed than the 5% sample, but it also contains less data.

PUMS is a valuable resource for journalists who want to do in-depth research on a variety of topics. It can be used to identify trends, track changes over time, and compare different groups of people. However, PUMS can be difficult to use, and it is important to understand the limitations of the data.

One of the main limitations of PUMS is that it is a sample. This means that the data is not perfectly representative of the population as a whole. The sample is also weighted, which means that some groups of people are represented more heavily than others.

Another limitation of PUMS is that it is not updated frequently. The 2020 PUMS data will not be released until 2023. This means that journalists who want to use PUMS to study current events will need to use data from the 2010 census or earlier.

Despite its limitations, PUMS is a valuable resource for journalists who want to do in-depth research on a variety of topics. It is important to understand the limitations of the data, but PUMS can be used to produce accurate and informative stories.
