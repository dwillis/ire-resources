  "description": "CNNMoney found that with the power of government agencies behind them, debt collectors like Linebarger are able to play by their own rules, in essence acting above the law. Thanks to legal exemptions, government collectors usually don’t have to follow the main federal law that regulates the debt collection industry. State consumer protection laws often don’t apply either. And when debtors have challenged Linebarger's government collections work in court based on other laws, the firm has gone so far as to argue it has immunity because it is an extension of the government.",
