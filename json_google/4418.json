This is a very long and detailed guide to finding and analyzing data on the FEC website. It is written by Christopher Schnaars, a reporter for USA Today. The guide covers a lot of ground, from how to find individual reports to how to use the weekly master files. It also includes a section on the pros and cons of using each type of data.

The guide is very helpful and informative, and it would be a valuable resource for anyone who is interested in analyzing campaign finance data. However, it is also very long and detailed, and it may be overwhelming for someone who is new to this topic.

If you are new to campaign finance data, I would recommend starting with the section on the weekly master files. This is a good way to get a quick overview of the data that is available. Once you have a better understanding of the data, you can then move on to the section on individual reports.

The guide is also very helpful in terms of explaining the different types of data that are available. For example, it explains the difference between contributions and expenditures, and it explains the different types of schedules that are included in Form 3.

Overall, this is a very helpful and informative guide. It would be a valuable resource for anyone who is interested in analyzing campaign finance data.
