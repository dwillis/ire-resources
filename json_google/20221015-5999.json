At this virtual conference, we’ll have a kickoﬀ meeting instead of a breakfast, but otherwise things will look similar: IRE will still match mentors and mentees, and you’ll still have an opportunity to set up one-on-one meetings on our virtual conference platform. Connections made during these meetings can grow and develop organically long after the conference.",
