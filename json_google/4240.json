  "description": "Compstat is a performance management system that was developed by the New York Police Department in the 1990s. It has since been adopted by police departments across the United States. Compstat involves the use of data to identify crime hot spots and to hold police officers and commanders accountable for reducing crime. While Compstat has been credited with reducing crime in some cities, it has also been criticized for leading to unintended consequences, such as the underreporting of crime and the use of excessive force.",
