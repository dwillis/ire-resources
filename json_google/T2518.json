  "description": "Investigative reporters may not be on the front lines of war or tragedy. But interviewing victims and witnesses, reviewing records of tragedy, viewing photos and video and assembling the stories of traumatic events all can have a profound emotional impact. Psychologists describe this as \"vicarious traumatization,\" which can result in the symptoms of PTSD, depression, anxiety and other difficulties.",
