  "description": "In a lot of ways, it is getting harder to locate people. The Social Security Administration now lets people get new numbers if they claim to be victims of identity theft or stalking, and a growing number of states let alleged abuse victims use a dummy Post Office box on all state and local government forms. Even if they aren’t trying to hide, a lot of people don’t show up with current addresses or telephone numbers in free internet telephone books or even at the Registry of Motor Vehicles. If free searches don’t come up with what you want, how should you evaluate which fee-based services to try next?",
