  "description": "The new American FactFinder (AFF) was released on January 18, 2011 to the general public. In February, after the deployment of the 2010 Decennial Census Redistricting Data, the Census Bureau began to receive negative feedback regarding the design and usability of the new AFF. Significant criticism coming from the general public and other key Census Bureau Stakeholders in March. Usability Enhancement Efforts Begin in August 2011. Based upon the feedback analysis, usability challenges were grouped by the American FactFinder Key User Segments. Surfer (Novice User) Confused about where to start Too many clicks to get to data (just wants a number) Too many search results (all look the same, titles are confusing) Confused by Census Jargon/Terminology Not enough on the site to entertain them Manipulator (Advanced User) Expecting “Google-like” Search Does not understand why certain dead ends are encountered Frustrated with limited browser support Wants more tools and guidance on how to create customized table views, charts and maps Portrayer (Novice to Advanced) Confused by Geographic Selection (overlay) Can’t find summarized data on their community (e.g. Fact Sheet) Does not understand faceted navigation and why certain topics appear/disappear based upon selections Frustrated with limited browser support Extractor (Expert User) Does not know where to start on the site to get to large volume downloads Does not know what is data is available on the site (release schedule) Encounters slow performance and errors when trying to perform high volume download A phased approach has been planned to implement enhancements to address the usability issues. The phased approach includes initially enhancing existing components of the system and then building new functionality and releasing these in a phased approach. Enhance Existing Components Build New Capabilities Finalize and Refine Quick Data Finder Part I Community Facts Part I Express Download Part I Geography Assistant Part I Search Results Refinement Data Release Schedule on Site Manage Dead Ends (Indexing) Phase 1 Quick Data Finder Part II Community Facts Part II Express Download Part II Navigation Wizard Geography Assistant Part II Site Search Manage Dead Ends (messaging) Phase 2 Phase 3 Improving performance of current functionality Simplifying complexity in the system New geographic selection method - List tab Quick links to summarized data about a geography Improved download performance and increased limits on amount of data that can be downloaded Major enhancements and introduction of new ways to interact with AFF - based on a users task or need (January 2013) Increase system performance and expand support for additional Internet browsers Increase ability of Internet search engines to find information within AFF (website crawlability) There has been a positive trend in end user satisfaction scores with the initial enhancement releases to AFF Enhancement Release 1/19/2012 60 50 Satisfaction Score 40 30 20 10 0 Enhancement Release 4/26/2012 August 2012 Release Focused on addressing key business priorities for Data Providers/Program Areas to maximize the efficiency, timeliness and accuracy of the dissemination products and services including: Table Services Download & Messaging Search & Navigation Quick Start & Search Overlay Enhancements Other Enhancements Table Services Enhancements The Table Services enhancements aim to address user frustrations regarding table modification.
