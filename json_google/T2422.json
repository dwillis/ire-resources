  "description": "Sports investigations come in two basic flavors: those that speak to the interests of fans and those that speak to the interests of society. Stories in the former category usually involve evidence and allegations of cheating the competition, while stories in the latter category often focus on issues such as race, gender, sex, violence, and academic fraud. The best sports investigations often engage both of the above news consumer groups by connecting the ‘sports world’ to the ‘real world.’",
