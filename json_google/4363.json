This is a very comprehensive and well-written guide to basic statistical analysis in Excel. I particularly appreciate the way you have explained the concepts in plain language, without using jargon or complex formulas. I am sure that this guide will be very helpful to journalists who are new to statistics.

One thing that I would add is a discussion of the limitations of statistics. It is important to remember that statistics can be used to mislead as well as to inform. Journalists should always be aware of the potential for bias in the data they are using, and they should be careful not to draw conclusions that are not supported by the data.

Overall, this is an excellent resource for journalists who want to learn more about basic statistical analysis. I highly recommend it.
