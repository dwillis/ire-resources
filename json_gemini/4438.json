  "title": "A SIGNAL DESIGN APPROACH TO THE OPTIMIZATION OF A DIGITAL DATA TRANSMISSION SYSTEM",
  "description": "We assume that a signal distorted by gaussian noise after passing through a transmission path is detected by sampling it and correlating it with orthonormal waveforms at the receiver. After deriving an expression for the average probability of error in such a receiver, we examine the effects of optimizing the average probability of error as a function of the following signal design parameters: (a) dimensionality of the signal space, (b) energy per dimension, (c) correlation between the different dimensions. We finally discuss the effects of the finiteness of the sampling rate and the limitations imposed by the required bandwidth of the signal.",
