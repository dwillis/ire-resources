  "description": "This presentation by a data editor from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel provides a case study of how one reporter used FOIA requests to investigate a gun store that was selling large numbers of guns used to commit crimes. The reporter was able to find data to show that the store had been recommended for revocation of its license but had managed to stay in operation by having a new owner take out a new license.",
