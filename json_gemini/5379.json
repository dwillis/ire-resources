  "description": "This paper presents an internal replication of two analyses from the Christchurch Health and Development Study. The original analyses investigated the effects of three types of early life adversity on the development of conduct disorder and depression in late adolescence. The replication analyses used a different statistical technique to the original analyses, and the findings were largely robust to this difference in approach.",
