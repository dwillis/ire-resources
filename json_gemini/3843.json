 "title": "Towards Automatic Repository Generation: Experiments with Machine Learning",
 "description": "In this paper, we describe two experiments in which we explore how machine learning could help in reducing the cost of knowledge dissemination, making multimedia information more easily accessible. In the first experiment, we collected videos from an online repository and computed features using machine learning, grouping related videos together. In the second experiment, we collected web pages, applied machine learning to organize them, and generated a table of contents. Our goal was to produce a repository structure that may in the future guide users. We compared human and machine performance, which indicates potential for improvements and different types of interaction with online repositories.",
