  "description": "This presentation introduces generalized estimating equations (GEEs) for modeling clustered and correlated data. GEE is an extension of generalized linear models that can be used to analyze data that violates the assumption of independence. The presentation discusses the different types of GEE models, how to fit them in R using the gee() function, and how to interpret the results.",
