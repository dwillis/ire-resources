This repository includes data and walkthroughs for the NICAR '14 workshop. It covers:

* An overview of CartoDB
* A CartoDB tutorial
* A PostGIS tutorial

The workshop aims to introduce participants to PostGIS and the power of geospatial processing with open source tools. It uses the CartoDB platform to make learning more accessible, allowing participants to avoid installing PostGIS during the workshop.

The CartoDB dashboard is organized into several interfaces:

* Table manager: Used to manage datasets, including importing, deleting, and editing.
* Table view: Allows viewing and editing of data rows and columns, as well as filtering and querying using SQL.
* Map view: Visualizes geospatial data on a map, enabling styling and editing.
* Visualization: Combines multiple data layers and styles to create interactive maps that can be published and shared.
* Visualization manager: Manages published maps and visualizations.

Importing data into CartoDB is straightforward, supporting various formats such as CSV, KML, GeoJSON, and Shapefile. Users can drag and drop local files or import from URLs.

The workshop covers basic map styling techniques, including choropleths, category maps, and bubble maps, as well as adding interactive elements like infowindows and legends.

PostGIS, an extension for PostgreSQL, is introduced as a spatially-aware database that enables geospatial operations like finding the nearest neighbor of a point or calculating distances between points.

The workshop guides participants through essential SQL commands for filtering, ordering, limiting, selecting, and counting data.

Spatial joining using ST_Intersects() is demonstrated, allowing users to combine data from different tables based on geometric intersections.

Finally, the workshop covers calculating distances using ST_Distance() and ordering results, enabling participants to measure distances between geospatial features.
