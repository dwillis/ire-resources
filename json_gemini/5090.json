 "title": "Towards an End-to-End Framework for Cross-Document Event Extraction",
 "description": "This paper introduces a novel framework that enables the extraction of cross-event information from various news sources. The framework uses a semantic similarity calculation algorithm for clustering news articles to extract events. The proposed framework uses a classification module for extracting key events, which can be used for various natural language process! ing tasks, such as event tracking, and building chronicles.",
