  "description": "California Watch's investigation into seismic school safety exposed serious problems with the state's oversight of school construction. They found that the state architect's office routinely failed to enforce the Field Act, allowing children and teachers to occupy buildings with structural flaws and potential safety hazards. The investigation also found that the state architect's office has become closely aligned with the industry it regulates, with government officials becoming members of a lobbying group for school construction firms and attending industry events.",
