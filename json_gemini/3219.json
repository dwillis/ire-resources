  "description": "Estimating the impact velocity in forward-looking airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) systems is essential in the computation of surface reflectance. In this work, a novel approach to correct the impact velocity exploiting the remote sensing of the backscattered LiDAR signal is presented. Using advanced signal processing, an improved estimation of the distance between LiDAR and the ground is found, from which the impact velocity can be more accurately computed. The approach is implemented and validated using real airborne LiDAR recordings, and a significant improvement in the impact velocity accuracy is achieved compared to the conventional approach.",
