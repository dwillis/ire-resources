  "description": "This report examines the use of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) during the Bush administration. It finds that the number of FOIA requests declined, the backlog of requests was reduced, and fewer requests generated any information. The report also finds that the government increasingly used \"non-denial denials\" and \"executive privilege\" to withhold information.",
