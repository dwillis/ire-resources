"description": "Microsoft Access is a database management system (DBMS) which is more powerful than excel but more user-friendly than MySQL. Access is useful for generating individual records, working with multiple data tables, quickly filtering and analyzing data in separate tables, and may be the only database software available in the newsroom. Data can be added through manual entry or importing existing files.",
