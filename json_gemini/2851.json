  "description": "Microstructural characterization of films of TiN grown in an activated reactive evaporation system is presented. The films were deposited over glass and quartz substrates at temperatures ranging from 25 to 600 °C, measuring their thickness and morphology by means of scanning electron microscopy. The films presented a columnar structure with grains perpendicular to the substrate surface. The grain size increased with the deposition temperature. The films were analyzed by X-ray diffraction, showing the presence of the TiN phase with preferential orientation (111).",
