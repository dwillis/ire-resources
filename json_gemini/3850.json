  "description": "This presentation introduces two machine learning techniques: document clustering and decision trees. The document clustering technique is called min hashing, and it works by converting every word in a document into a number and taking the lowest number. If two documents have the same number, they are considered similar. The decision tree technique is a non-linear way of representing data that can be used for classification and prediction.",
