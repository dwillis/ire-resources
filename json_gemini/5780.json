 "title": "Understanding Online Harassment: A Preliminary Typology and Research Agenda",
 "description": "This paper presents a preliminary typology of online harassment based on an inductive analysis of 129 cases. We identify seven types of harassment: 1) Flaming: aggressive and disrespectful messages; 2) Trolling: deliberately disruptive and attention-seeking messages; 3) Cyberbullying: repeated, targeted attacks intended to harm; 4) Doxing: revealing personal information without consent; 5) Impersonation: creating fake accounts to harass someone; 6) Hate speech: messages that attack people based on their race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or other protected characteristics; and 7) Threats: messages that threaten physical or sexual violence. We also discuss the implications of this typology for research and practice.",
