  "description": "PUMS, the next-best thing to raw census data itself, allows users to make cross-tabulations not provided in various summary files. Because its geography is based on PUMAs with minimum population of 100,000, place and county ID is limited. PUMS data is available in two flavors: 1% sample with data limitations but smaller PUMA geography, or 5% sample with generalized data but larger PUMA geography.",
