  "description": "CAFOs produce 335 million tons of dry manure per year, which is three times the amount generated by humans. Cow manure has more contaminants than human waste, and the average dairy cow produces 120 pounds of manure per day. One dairy CAFO of 10,000 animals produces as much waste as a city of 250,000 people. All earthen CAFO waste lagoons are designed to leak, and over-application of manure to fields can lead to massive water pollution, including contamination with nitrates, fecal coliform, pathogens, and fish kills.",
