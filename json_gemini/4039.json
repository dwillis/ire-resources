 "title": "Backscatter Analysis of Different Surface Features",
 "description": "The backscatter response of various surface features was analyzed using a two-frequency scatterometer. Five different surface features were studied, sand, loam, hay and concrete; and measurements were collected at 13.3 and 36.5 GHz. Angle measurements were obtained from 0 to 60 degrees with different polarization combinations such as VV, VH, HV, and HH. The results show that the measured backscatter response of different surface features can be distinguished by their backscatter values and their angular responses.",
