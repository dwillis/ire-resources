  "description": "In the United States between 2007 and 2016, at least 1.83 million guns were reported stolen, the vast majority of which were not stolen from gun stores. There is limited national data on what happens to most of the stolen guns, but some insights can be gleaned from the data on guns that are recovered by law enforcement. This data is available through a public records request.",
