  "description": "This study's findings present evidence of the significant effect of methodological partisanship on how political elites and everyday Americans interpretet and discuss the information contained in the Starr Report on President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky. The study includes data from surveys conducted in the wake of the Starr Report's release. These surveys' results indicate that Republicans and Democrats differed in their opinion of the Starr Report's credibility; they also differed in the amount of attention they paid to the different allegations against the President. The Republican Party, to which Clinton is opposed, was more likely than the Democratic Party to both interpret the report as credible and pay more attention to the more salacious details of the allegations than the more general conclusions drawn by the report.",
