  "description": "This study used content analysis to investigate what effect, if any, the presence of a newsprint publisher has on the newspaper coverage of a political campaign. Two local elections were studied in two Texas daily newspapers, one with a newsprint owner and one without. The results suggest that there is an association between newsprint ownership and newspaper coverage of an election campaign.",
