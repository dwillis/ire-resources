 "description": "The census provides data that can be used for a variety of stories beyond basic population and race changes. This includes topics such as the location of elderly people not living in nursing homes, the ratio of single elderly women to single elderly men, the concentration of college grads over 25 still living with their parents, the value of commuting to the big city from the suburbs, the highest clusters of shrinks, clerics and telemarketers, and whoâ€™s still heating their house with coal and running to the outhouse when nature calls.",
