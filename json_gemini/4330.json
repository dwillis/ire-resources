  "description": "Web search engines are powerful tools for information retrieval. However, they typically return a large number of documents that may or may not contain the desired information. To narrow down the search results, users can refine their queries by adding additional keywords or phrases. However, this process can be time-consuming and tedious, especially when the user is not familiar with the domain of the search query. In this paper, we present a novel approach to question answering on the Web that leverages natural language processing techniques to automatically extract relevant information from search results. Our approach can be used to answer a wide range of questions, including factual questions, definition questions, and event questions. We evaluate our approach on a large dataset of questions and show that it can achieve high accuracy.",
