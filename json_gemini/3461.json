 "description": "The criminal justice beat can be one of the most data-rich beats in a newsroom, but information is fragmented among different agencies and jurisdictions. This handout provides a starting point for requesting data, including incident-level and arrest data, jail bookings, blood-alcohol test results, court case history, jury selection transcripts, sentencing commission data, state conviction files, criminal justice statistics centers, and data from the U.S. Department of Justice, the National Archive of Criminal Justice Data, and other sources.",
