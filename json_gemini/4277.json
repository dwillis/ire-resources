Skinner, 179 Ala. 654, 60 So. 812 (Ala. 1912); Stone v. Consolidated Publishing Co., 404 So. 2d 678 (1981); Chambers v. Birmingham News Co., 552 So. 2d 854 (Ala. 1989); Birmingham Education Ass’n v. Birmingham City Bd. of Educ., CV 4-637 at 2-3 (Cir. Ct. of Jefferson County, Ala., Nov. 15, 1995); Walsh v. Barnes, 541 So. 2d 33, 35 (Ala. Civ. App. 1989); Blankenship v. City of Hoover, 590 So. 2d 245 (Ala. 1991); Scott v. Culpepper, 220 Ala. 393, 393, 125 So. 643, 643 (1930) Prior to 1923, only common law precedence offered the public access to certain records once the requester demonstrated a qualified interest. The first public records law codified the public’s right to inspect and copy documents and has since been amended twice – once in 1983 and again in 2004 – to specify exemptions. Alabama’s Public Records Law today is a relatively short, sweeping statement found in Section 36-12-40 of the Alabama Code. Due to its brevity and lack of detail, the Alabama Supreme Court has played a significant role in defining exemptions. Grounds for exclusion, however, are narrowly construed and favor disclosure.",
  "description": "Alabama law states every citizen has the right to access public records, and the specified purpose of the request will not be considered.  The law applies to all three branches of state government and has been interpreted by the courts and attorney general to apply to various city, county, and municipal entities.",
