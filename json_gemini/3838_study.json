 "description": "This study explores the use of entity linking to create 3D visualizations of financial news. The authors use a variety of techniques to extract entities from financial news articles, including named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and semantic role labeling. They then use these entities to create a knowledge graph that represents the relationships between the entities. Finally, they use this knowledge graph to create 3D visualizations of the financial news articles.",
