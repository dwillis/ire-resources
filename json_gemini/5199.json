  "description": "This report argues that tax expenditures, or special tax benefits, are a major source of revenue loss for the state of New Mexico. The report finds that these tax breaks are often ineffective and do not lead to the promised economic benefits. The report recommends that the state should eliminate or reduce these tax breaks in order to increase revenue and fund important public services.",
