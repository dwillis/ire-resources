  "description": "The field of network communication has undergone major improvements over the past several years with the help of advances in coding theory and signal design. However, with these advances came the need for complex and costly error-correcting techniques. This book offers a solution to this problem by using redundant transmission which results in a novel scheme for generating signal waveforms in the frequency domain. The book is divided into several chapters. The first chapter begins by introducing the topic of redundant transmission followed by the introduction to signal waveforms and second order statistics. Chapter two is dedicated to the linear minimum mean-square error filtering problem. Chapter three discusses coding using trellis codes while Chapter 4 focuses on the application of redundant transmission to echo cancellation. The book concludes with a chapter on parametric and nonparametric spectral estimation techniques and a final chapter on bandlimited orthogonal sequences and their linearity properties. The author, Dr. C.P. Kwong, is a practicing engineer and received his B.S.E.E., M.S.E.E., and Ph.D degrees from the University of California at Berkeley in 1975, 1977, and 1981, respectively.",
