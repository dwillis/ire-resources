Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an IRE & NICAR conference. The user provided detailed instructions on how each key should be filled.

First, the id is 5280 as specified. Next, authors are Sarah Hutchins and Lauren Grandestaff. Their emails aren't listed, so those will be null. Affiliation for both is IRE since that's where they're presenting.

The conference is clearly IRE & NICAR, so I'll list both. The year isn't mentioned, so it's "Not Listed". The title should capture the main topic, which is about backgrounding people and businesses.

For the description, a concise summary of the tipsheet: techniques for investigating individuals and companies using various tools like Google, Nexis, and public records.

Keywords are the main tools and concepts mentioned: Backgrounding, Public Records, Nexis, Google Scholar, Wayback Machine. I'll pick five to keep it under the limit.

I need to ensure all keys are in English and properly quoted. No markdown, just a clean JSON structure.
