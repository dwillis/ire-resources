Alright, I need to create a JSON object from the given tipsheet data. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id is straightforwardâ€”T1593. 

Next, authors: There's only one author mentioned here, Jim Hopkins. His email and affiliation are provided as jhopkins@usatoday.com and USA TODAY respectively. So I'll set up an array with a single object containing name, email, and affiliation.

The conference is clearly stated as the IRE Annual Conference in San Francisco, so that's easy. The year is given as 2002, so I don't need to leave it as "Not Listed".

For the title, the session was titled "Data for Better Business Coverage" by Jim Hopkins from USA TODAY.

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about building a database of private companies to help reporters gather information since these businesses don't have much public documentation. So I'll summarize that into one or two sentences.

Keywords should capture the main points without including the conference or authors. Terms like "private companies", "database", "business reporting", and "email survey" seem relevant. I'll pick four key terms here.

I need to ensure all keys are in quotes, values too unless they're null. Since all information is present except for maybe the description being concise, but it's covered. So putting it all together, the JSON should look clean with proper syntax and commas where needed.
