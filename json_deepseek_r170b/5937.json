Alright, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. They've given specific instructions on the structure, so I need to make sure each key is correctly addressed.

First, I notice that the id should be 5937 as specified. Next, the authors section requires extracting names, emails, and affiliations. Looking at the tipsheet, there are three authors mentioned: Chris Vanderveen from 9News.com, Melanie Woodrow from ABC7News.com, and Jeremy Rogalski from KHOU.com. Their contact info isn't provided, so I'll set email to null for each.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE" since it's an IRE event in Houston 2019, so that goes under the conference key with year 2019. The title of the tipsheet is "Broadcast Deep Dives 3." For the description, I need a concise summary. It seems the tipsheet covers investigative journalism techniques, particularly on surprise medical bills and clergy abuse.

Keywords should be no more than five terms. From the content, relevant keywords are "investigative journalism," "surprise medical billing," and "clergy abuse." I'll stick with those three as they capture the essence of the topics discussed.

I also need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Each key must be correctly formatted without any markdown. Let me structure this step by step, making sure each part aligns with the user's instructions.
