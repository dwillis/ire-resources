Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. The input provided includes information about deportations of Haitians, an investigation by the Florida Center for Investigative Reporting, and some details about detentions violating laws. 

First, I'll note the speakers: Andy Hall and Trevor Aaronson, with Evelyn Larrubia as the moderator. Since there are no emails or affiliations mentioned beyond their names, those fields will be null.

The conference isn't explicitly stated in the text. It could be either IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed. Given that it's from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference, I'll set the conference to "IRE". However, since the year isn't provided, it'll remain as "Not Listed".

The title should reflect the main topic, so I'll go with "Deportation of Haitians and Detention Practices." The description needs a concise summary: "An investigation revealed that over 250 Haitians deported by the U.S. face harsh detention conditions in Haiti, violating both Haitian law and international treaties."

For keywords, relevant terms are deportation, Haiti, detention, human rights, and immigration.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with the specified keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

```json
{
  "id": "3752_1",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Florida Center for Investigative Reporting"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Deportation of Haitians and Detention Practices",
  "description": "An investigation revealed that over 250 Haitians deported by the U.S. face harsh detention conditions in Haiti, violating both Haitian law and international treaties.",
  "keywords": [
    "deportation",
    "Haiti",
    "detention",
    "human rights",
    "immigration"
  ]
}
```
