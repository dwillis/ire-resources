Alright, let's see what the user is asking for here. They provided a tipsheet from an IRE conference session about coordinating investigative teams. The task is to create a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, I need to parse the input correctly. The id is given as 3990_2, so that's straightforward. For the authors section, Greg Borowski is listed with his email and affiliation at the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Since there are no other authors mentioned, the list will have only one entry.

Next, the conference is clearly stated as IRE, and the year is 2013. The title of the session is "Coordinating an investigative team." 

The description needs to be a concise summary. I'll focus on the main idea: helping managers lead investigative teams effectively despite challenges. It should mention empowering staff and fostering collaboration.

For keywords, I need up to five relevant terms. "Investigative journalism," "team coordination," "newsroom management," "project planning," and "collaboration" seem appropriate, avoiding the conference name and author.

I have to ensure all fields are properly enclosed in quotes and that the JSON syntax is correct. No markdown or extra text should be included beyond the JSON object.
