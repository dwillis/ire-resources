Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided input. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the ID is given as 5657, so that's straightforward.

Next, authors. The input lists several people who were interviewed: Dave Cuillier, Mike Donoghue, Kathy Kiely, Andrew Seaman, Shannon Shaw Duty, Miranda Spivack, Lee Van Der Voo, and Todd Wallack. I need to list each of them as objects with name, email, and affiliation.

Looking at each author:
- Dave Cuillier is the director of the University of Arizona School of Journalism. So his affiliation is clear.
- Mike Donoghue is the executive director of the Vermont Press Association and VP of the New England First Amendment Coalition. I'll list both affiliations.
- Kathy Kiely has two roles: Press Freedom Fellow for the National Press Club Journalism Institute and lecturer at the University of New Hampshire.
- Andrew Seaman chairs the Society of Professional Journalists’ Ethics Committee. That's his affiliation.
- Shannon Shaw Duty is the editor of Osage News and chair of NAJA’s Free Press Committee.
- Miranda Spivack is a professor at DePauw University.
- Lee Van Der Voo is a freelance journalist, so I'll note that as her affiliation since no specific organization is mentioned.
- Todd Wallack is with the Boston Globe's Spotlight team.

Emails aren't provided, so they'll be null for everyone. Affiliations are based on what's written next to their names in the input.

For the conference, the text doesn't mention where this tipsheet was presented, so it should be "Not Listed".

The year isn't specified either, so that will also be "Not Listed".

The title is at the top: "Reporting on Public Records and Open Meetings". That's clear.

Description needs to be a concise summary. The document provides tips for journalists on covering public records and open meetings, emphasizing the importance of transparency and persistence.

Keywords should be relevant terms excluding conference and authors. I'll pick: "public records", "open meetings", "government transparency", "journalism ethics", "investigative reporting".

Now, putting it all together in JSON format with proper syntax.
