Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from Sarah Blustain of The Investigative Fund. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id is straightforward: it's given as 4932.

Next, looking at the authors section. The only author mentioned here is Sarah Blustain. Her name is provided, so that goes in. There's no email address listed, so I'll leave that null. For affiliation, since she's from The Investigative Fund, that should be her affiliation.

The conference isn't explicitly mentioned, but looking at the context, it's an IRE (Investigative Reporters and Editors) conference. So the conference key will be "IRE". 

For the year, there's no specific information given in the text, so I'll set that to "Not Listed".

The title of the tipsheet is clearly stated as "Tip Sheet — Sarah Blustain, deputy editor, The Investigative Fund".

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet explains what kinds of stories they commission and gives guidance on submitting proposals. So the description should capture that essence in 1-2 sentences.

Keywords are next. I need up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords would include "investigative reporting", "story commissioning", "freelance journalism support", "grant opportunities", and "journalism funding".

Putting it all together, each key should be in quotes, and strings should be properly enclosed. I'll make sure that all values are correctly placed without any markdown formatting.

Let me double-check to ensure no required fields are missed and that the structure aligns with the user's instructions.
