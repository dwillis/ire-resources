Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query and the provided input. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, the structure should include specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The ID is given as "4976_2". 

Looking at the input, I see multiple sections with different articles and tips from conferences. The main focus seems to be on investigative reporting techniques using data and documents.

For the authors, each section lists names like Tom McGinty, Christopher Weaver, Anna Wilde Mathews, and others. Some have affiliations like Wall Street Journal or Washington Post. I'll need to list each author with their name, email, and affiliation if available. Since emails aren't provided, they will be null.

The conference is the 2017 CAR Conference in Jacksonville, FL, so that's clear. The year is 2017 as well. 

The title should reflect the main theme of combining documents and data, which is mentioned at the beginning. So I'll go with "Marrying Documents and Data (aka Investigative Reporting)".

For the description, a concise summary: It's about using data and records to expose trends and issues in police shootings and corporate practices.

Keywords should be relevant terms from the contentâ€”police shootings, Medicare billing, corporate jets, etc. I'll limit it to five.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes without any markdown.
