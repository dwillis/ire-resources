Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given input. The user provided a detailed tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference, specifically NICAR 2002. 

First, I'll identify each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

- **id**: Given as T1510.
- **authors**: The input mentions Paul D'Ambrosio with email pmd@app.com and affiliation Asbury Park (NJ) Press. So the authors list will have one object with name "Paul D'Ambrosio", email, and affiliation.
- **conference**: It's NICAR, as stated in the text.
- **year**: Clearly 2002 from NICAR 2002.
- **title**: The main title is "Doctors on drugs And other physician problems".
- **description**: A concise summary. The series investigated a secret substance abuse treatment program for doctors and how the medical board disciplined them, revealing lenient sanctions.
- **keywords**: I'll pick relevant terms like physician discipline, medical regulation, substance abuse, public safety, journalism investigation.

I need to ensure all values are in English and correctly formatted. No made-up names; since only Paul D'Ambrosio is listed, the authors list has one entry.

Now, putting it all together into a JSON structure.
