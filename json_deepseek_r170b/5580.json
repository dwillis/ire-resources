Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given input. The user provided a lot of text with various authors from different news organizations talking about how they manage stress. My task is to extract specific information from this text and structure it into a JSON format as per their instructions.

First, let me understand what each key in the JSON should contain:

- **id**: Should be 5580.
- **authors**: A list of objects, each with name, email, and affiliation. The names come from the quotes; if there's no name listed, set it to null. Affiliation is the news organization mentioned next to their name. Email isn't provided, so that can be null.
- **conference**: It should be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Since the input doesn't specify a conference, I'll go with "Not Listed".
- **year**: If not clearly stated, set it to "Not Listed".
- **title**: Not provided, so set it to null.
- **description**: A 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. The text is about journalists sharing stress management techniques, so the description should reflect that.
- **keywords**: Up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Words like stress, journalism, coping mechanisms, etc.

Now, I'll go through each author mention:

1. **Eric Eyre**
   - Affiliation: Charleston Gazette-Mail
2. **Sarah Kendzior**
   - Affiliation: None explicitly mentioned, but she's known from #TheResistance, so maybe leave affiliation as null or take it from the text if any.
3. **Jason Leopold**
   - Affiliation: BuzzFeed News
4. **Derek Willis**
   - Affiliation: ProPublica
5. **Dana Priest**
   - Affiliation: The Washington Post
6. **T. Christian Miller**
   - Affiliation: ProPublica
7. **Sasha Chavkin**
   - Affiliation: CIR/Reveal
8. **Michael Grabell**
   - Affiliation: ProPublica
9. **Topher Sanders**
   - Affiliation: ProPublica
10. **Ariel Stidham**
    - Affiliation: The Boston Globe

Wait, looking back at the text, each quote starts with a name and their affiliation is sometimes mentioned right after. For example, "Eric Eyre (Charleston Gazette-Mail)" so I can extract that.

I need to make sure each author's entry includes their name and correct affiliation. If no affiliation is next to their name in the text, set it as null. Emails are not provided, so those will be null.

For the description, since all these authors are talking about how they manage stress while working in journalism, I can summarize that.

Keywords would include terms like "stress management", "journalism", "productivity", etc., but limited to five.

I also need to make sure the JSON structure is correct with all keys properly enclosed and values as specified. No markdown should be present in the final JSON.
