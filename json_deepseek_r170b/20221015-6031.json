Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided query about backgrounding candidates for an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me break down what's needed.

First, I'll look at the id, which is given as 6031. That part is straightforward.

Next, authors. The input includes Sandra Fish, along with her email and affiliation as a Colorado data journalist. Since there are no other authors mentioned, the list will have only one entry with her details.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE 2020, so the conference key is set to "IRE" and the year is 2020.

For the title, it's "Backgrounding candidates - 10 things," which I'll use exactly as provided.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet provides 10 steps for investigating candidates, including checking news archives, voting history, court records, social media, financial disclosures, campaign finance, professional licenses, and property records. So the description should capture that it's about investigative steps to research candidates effectively.

Keywords are next. I'll pick relevant terms like "backgrounding," "investigative reporting," "candidate research," "public records," and "campaign finance." These encapsulate the main topics without including the conference or author names.

I also need to ensure all keys and values are in English, enclosed in quotes, and that the JSON structure is correct. No markdown should be present in the final output.
