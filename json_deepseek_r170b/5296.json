Okay, so I need to help create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down what's required.

First, the id is fixed at 5296. That part's straightforward.

Next, authors. The input mentions Liz Navratil with her email and phone number. I should create an object for her with name set to "Liz Navratil", email as given, and affiliation as "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette" since that's the news organization linked in the project URL.

Conference is clearly IRE because it mentions the IRE Philadelphia Watchdog Workshop.

Year isn't specified, so it'll be "Not Listed".

Title comes from the header: "Digging Deeper with Data". 

Description needs to be a brief summary. The tipsheet talks about using data journalism without needing advanced skills and includes examples like the Missing Fugitives project. So I can mention that in one or two sentences.

Keywords are up to five, excluding conference and authors. Looking through the content: data journalism, Excel, SQL, investigation, NICAR (though NICAR is a conference, so maybe not include it as a keyword). Wait, NICAR is part of IRE, so perhaps focus on tools like Excel and SQL. Also, terms like "investigation" or "tools" might be relevant. Let me see: data journalism, Excel, SQL, investigative reporting.

Putting it all together, the JSON should have these elements with proper structure.

```json

  "id": 5296,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Liz Navratil",
      "email": "lnavratil@post-gazette.com",
      "affiliation": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Digging Deeper with Data",
  "description": "Learn how to use data journalism effectively without needing advanced technical skills, including examples from the Missing Fugitives project.",
  "keywords": ["data journalism", "Excel", "SQL", "investigative reporting"]
}
```
