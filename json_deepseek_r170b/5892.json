Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the user provided detailed information from a session titled "Nail the Interview: How to Get Sensitive or Hard-to-Reach Sources to Talk." The authors listed are Brett Murphy, Kiran Chawla, and JoNel Aleccia, each with their respective affiliations. 

I should start by extracting the necessary fields as per the user's instructions. The JSON must have keys like id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. 

The ID is given as 5892, so that’s straightforward. For the authors, I need to list each one with their name, email, and affiliation. Brett Murphy is from USA Today, Kiran Chawla from WAFB, and JoNel Aleccia from Kaiser Health News. Their emails are also provided in the query.

The conference is IRE, so that's set. The year isn't explicitly mentioned, so it'll be "Not Listed." The title is clear: "Nail the Interview: How to Get Sensitive or Hard-to-Reach Sources to Talk."

For the description, I need a concise summary. The session focuses on interviewing sensitive sources like trauma victims and provides strategies for reaching them. So, the description will mention techniques for engaging with such sources.

Keywords should be up to five terms, excluding conference and authors. Relevant keywords here are "sensitive sources," "interviewing," "investigative journalism," "trauma," and "reporting."

Putting it all together, I structure each part accordingly. Making sure emails and affiliations are correctly assigned, and the description is a clear, simple summary.

I also need to ensure that all values are in English and properly quoted. No markdown or additional formatting—just pure JSON.

Double-checking everything, it looks like I've covered all required fields without any missing data. Time to compile this into the final JSON object.
