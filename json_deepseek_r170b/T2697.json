Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, looking at the input, the tipsheet is about investigating Big Pharma's clinical trials, specifically focusing on SFBC International and issues related to institutional review boards (IRBs). The author mentioned is David Evans from Bloomberg Markets Magazine. His contact information is provided, so I can include that in the authors array.

The id should be T2697 as per the instructions. The conference is clearly stated as IRE, and since the year isn't explicitly mentioned but there's a date (May 17, 2006) related to an event in the tipsheet, I'll assume the conference year might be around that time or use "Not Listed" if unsure. Wait, looking again, the user example used 2006, so I should include that.

The title of the tipsheet is about Big Pharma's shameful secrets regarding clinical trials. The description needs to be a concise summary. I'll mention how pharmaceutical companies outsource clinical trials and issues with oversight by IRBs.

For keywords, I'll focus on relevant terms like Clinical Trials, Contract Research Organizations (CROs), Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), Big Pharma, and Human Subject Protection.

I should ensure all the keys are in quotes and that the JSON structure is correctly formatted. Also, make sure not to include any markdown in the final response as per the user's request.
