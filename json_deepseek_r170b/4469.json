Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conferences. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, the ID is straightforward—4469 as specified.

Next, for the authors section, I see that George Pawlaczyk and Beth Hundsdorfer are listed. They both have emails and affiliations mentioned. The affiliation should be their news organization, which in this case is Belleville News-Democrat (BND). So each author object will include their name, email, and affiliation.

The conference is IRE since the tipsheet mentions it's from an IRE event.

Looking for the year, I don't see a specific year mentioned in the provided text. So the year should be "Not Listed".

The title of the tipsheet isn't explicitly given, but based on the content, I can infer that it's about investigating failure to prosecute felony sex crimes. So I'll create a concise title reflecting that.

For the description, I need a 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. The tipsheet provides methods for tracking prosecution rates and analyzing data, so the description should capture that essence.

Keywords are next—no more than five terms excluding conference and authors. Relevant keywords here would be "prosecution failure," "felony sex crimes," "investigative reporting," "criminal justice system," and "data analysis."

Now, putting all these together into a JSON structure with proper formatting and ensuring that all values are enclosed in quotes.

I should also double-check to make sure there are no made-up names and that affiliations are correctly attributed. Since the emails are provided, they should be included as well.

So, everything seems to align with the instructions given. Time to assemble the JSON accordingly.
