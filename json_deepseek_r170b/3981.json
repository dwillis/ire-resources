Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided specific instructions with several keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, I'll assign the id as 3981 since that's what was instructed.

Next, for the authors section, I see Greg LeRoy is listed as the Executive Director of Good Jobs First. Thereâ€™s also mention of Phil Mattera from Good Jobs First, who is their Research Director. Other names like Julie Patel and Patrick Madden are mentioned, but they don't have affiliations or emails provided. So I'll include them with nulls for email and affiliation.

The conference is clearly stated as Investigative Reporters and Editors in San Antonio on June 21, 2013, so the conference key will be "IRE" and the year is 2013.

For the title, it's "Investigating Job Subsidies, True Costs & Campaign $ Connections."

The description should be a concise summary. I'll mention that the tipsheet examines job subsidies, their costs, connections to campaign finances, and provides research methods and resources from Good Jobs First.

Keywords need to be up to five terms. Looking at the content, "Job Subsidies," "Corporate Welfare," "Campaign Finance," "Economic Development," and "Good Jobs First" are relevant and not too many.

Putting it all together, I structure each key with appropriate values, ensuring that authors are a list of dictionaries with name, email, and affiliation. Emails and affiliations are null where information isn't provided.
