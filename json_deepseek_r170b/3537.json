Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tip sheet from the IRE 2011 Conference. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the user specified that the JSON should have certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is given as 3537, so that's straightforward.

Looking at the tip sheet, it was presented by Megan Oâ€™Matz from the Sun Sentinel in Fort Lauderdale. Her email is momatz@sunsentinel.com. Since there's only one author, I'll create an authors array with a single object containing her name, email, and affiliation as "Sun Sentinel."

The conference is clearly stated as IRE 2011 in Orlando, so conference will be "IRE" and year is 2011.

For the title, the tip sheet is about covering schools and construction, so I'll use "Covering Schools and School Construction: Spotting Corruption and Mismanagement." That seems descriptive enough.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tips focus on investigating corruption in school construction projects through various data points like enrollment numbers, cost reports, lobbyist involvement, etc. So the description could summarize that it's about ideas for spotting issues by examining these areas.

Keywords should capture the essence without including the conference or authors. Relevant terms might be "school construction," "corruption," "mismanagement," "lobbyists," and "audits." I'll pick the top five from these.

I also need to make sure all values are in English, enclosed in quotes, and that no keys or values are missed. Since the year is clearly 2011, that's set. The title should be a string, and keywords an array of strings.

Putting it all together, I structure each key appropriately. The authors array has one entry with Megan's details. The description is brief but covers the main points. Keywords are limited to five and relevant.

I think that's everything. Now, I'll format this into proper JSON syntax.
