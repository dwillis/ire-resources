Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, looking at the input provided, it's from a workshop titled "Better Watchdog Workshop" held in Tempe, AZ on February 22, 2003. The author is Dan Meyers, who works as a Projects Editor at The Denver Post. His contact information is also included: phone number 303-820-1555 and email dmeyers@denverpost.com.

The tipsheet itself is divided into two pages. The first page discusses strategies for effective interviewing, such as listening actively, handling reluctant or confrontational sources, and diversifying sources. It includes some useful links to resources like IRE's training materials and other journalism tools. The second page lists 17 records journalists should check before writing about someone, including real estate, voter registration, business records, etc.

Now, the user wants me to convert this into a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. Let's break down each key:

1. **id**: The user specified it should be "T1801", so I'll set that as is.
2. **authors**: This should be a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. Since the only author mentioned is Dan Meyers from The Denver Post, his details will go here. His email is provided, and his affiliation is clear.
3. **conference**: Looking at the input, it's an IRE event, so conference is "IRE".
4. **year**: The date of the workshop is February 22, 2003, so year should be 2003.
5. **title**: The title given in the tipsheet is "Sources and Interviews Tip Sheet".
6. **description**: Needs to be a concise summary. I'll mention that it covers strategies for interviewing sources and lists key records to check before writing about individuals.
7. **keywords**: Up to five relevant terms, excluding conference and authors. Keywords like "interviewing", "sources", "investigative journalism", etc., are appropriate.

I also need to ensure all values are in English, enclosed in quotes, and that the structure is correct without any markdown formatting as per the user's instructions.
