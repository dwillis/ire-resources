Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Cheryl W. Thompson's presentation at an IRE conference. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look for the id. The user specified that it should be 5517, so that's straightforward.

Next, the authors section. There's only one author mentioned here: Cheryl W. Thompson. Her emails are provided as cheryl.thompson@washpost.com and thompsonc@gwu.edu. The affiliation would be The Washington Post since she works there, even though she's also associated with George Washington University.

The conference is clearly stated as the IRE Watchdog Workshop, so that goes under conference. The year is April 2018, so I'll note that as 2018.

For the title, it's "The Investigative Interview". 

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. Looking at the tipsheet, Cheryl provides advice on conducting effective interviews for investigative reporting, so I'll phrase it simply.

Keywords should include relevant terms like "investigative journalism", "interview techniques", and "reporting strategies" based on the content. I'll limit them to five as instructed.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, no made-up names; since there's only one author, that simplifies things.
