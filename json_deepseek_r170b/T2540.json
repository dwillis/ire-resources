Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the input, the title is "Why geeks are a new breed in the newsroom: Making computer-assisted reporting one of your main skills." The author is Mc Nelly Torres, who works as a Government reporter at Sun-Sentinel. Their email is mntorres@sun-sentinel.com.

The conference mentioned is both the IRE Better Watchdog Workshop and the NAHJ National Convention in Fort Worth, Texas. But since the user instructions specify that the conference should be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed," I'll go with "IRE" because it's explicitly an IRE event.

The year isn't clearly stated in the provided text, so according to the instructions, I'll set the year to "Not Listed."

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet emphasizes learning CAR (Computer-Assisted Reporting) skills for better storytelling with data, using tools like spreadsheets and databases, and how it enhances journalism by adding depth and uniqueness.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference names or authors. Relevant keywords here are "computer-assisted reporting," "CAR," "data journalism," "journalism skills," and "newsroom tools."

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with id T2540, authors as a list with one entry containing name, email, and affiliation. The description will be a brief summary. Keywords are listed in an array.

I need to ensure all values are enclosed in quotes and that there are no markdown formats. Also, since it's English, everything remains the same.
