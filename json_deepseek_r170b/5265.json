Okay, so I need to create a JSON object from the given input following specific guidelines. The user has provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference in Phoenix, 2017. They want me to structure this into a JSON with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, I'll note the ID is fixed at 5265. The conference is clearly stated as IRE, and the year is 2017 since it's the 2017 IRE Conference in Phoenix.

Looking for the title of the tipsheet, the main heading seems to be "Broadcast Deep Dives" under KARE 11 Investigates. So I'll use that as the title.

Next are the authors. The input lists A.J. Lagoe and Steve Eckert with their emails and affiliations (both at KARE 11). So each author will have name, email, and affiliation. Since both are from KARE 11, I'll set that as their affiliation.

For the description, it needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about starting with small stories and expanding them into deeper investigations, giving examples of VA issues and contractor fraud. So I can summarize that they show how small stories can lead to bigger investigative series.

Keywords should be no more than five terms excluding conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords would be "investigative journalism," "rolling investigations," "storytelling techniques," "VA benefits," and "contractor fraud."

Putting it all together, I structure each part into the JSON format as per the instructions.
