Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given input. Let me go through this step by step because it's a bit detailed.

First, I see that there are two authors mentioned: Danielle Ivory from The New York Times and David Barer from KXAN NEWS. Their contact information is provided, including emails and phone numbers. 

The title of the session or document seems to be about investigating long-term care facilities, focusing on data, tips, and sources. So I'll use that as the title.

For the description, it needs to be a concise summary. The text talks about using FOIA requests, analyzing data with Excel, and mapping locations with Google Maps. It also emphasizes humanizing stories by involving residents and workers, so I should mention those elements.

Keywords are next. They need to be no more than five terms. Looking at the content, important keywords would be "FOIA", "data journalism", "investigative reporting", "long-term care facilities", and "journalism tips". These capture the essence without including the conference or authors' names.

The conference isn't explicitly mentioned here, so I'll set that to "Not Listed". Similarly, the year isn't provided in the text, so it remains "Not Listed" as well.

I need to structure each author with their name, email, and affiliation. Danielle's affiliation is The New York Times, and David's is KXAN NEWS. Both have their emails listed, but only David has a phone number. Since phone isn't a required field in the JSON structure, I can ignore it.

Putting this all together, each author object will be part of an authors array within the main JSON object with id 5997.

```json
{
  "id": 5997,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The New York Times"
    },
    {
      "name": "David Barer",
      "email": "david.barer@kxan.com",
      "affiliation": "KXAN NEWS"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigating Long-Term Care Facilities: A Data-Driven Approach",
  "description": "This session provides tips and strategies for investigating long-term care facilities using data journalism techniques, including FOIA requests, Excel analysis, and Google Maps.",
  "keywords": [
    "FOIA",
    "data journalism",
    "investigative reporting",
    "long-term care facilities",
    "journalism tips"
  ]
}
```
