Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided specific instructions on the structure and content.

First, I'll extract the necessary information. The title is "Investigating airline safety." The description should be a concise summary, so I'll note that it's about databases for reporters researching airline safety issues.

Looking at the authors, there are two mentioned: Ames Alexander and Ted Mellnik. Both are affiliated with The Charlotte Observer. Their contact info includes phone numbers and an email for Ames. Since the user wants email and affiliation, I'll include those where available.

For keywords, I'll pick relevant terms like "airline safety," "databases," "NTSB," "FAA," and "aviation accidents." These capture the essence without including the conference or authors.

The conference is identified as IRE since it's from their event. The year isn't provided, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed."

Now, structuring all this into JSON with appropriate keys: id as T2055, authors as a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. Each value must be in quotes, and ensure the overall structure is correct.

I need to make sure there are no made-up names and handle any missing information by setting those fields to null. Also, keep all text in English unless specified otherwise.

Putting it all together, I'll format each section carefully, ensuring proper syntax with commas and brackets. Double-checking that all required keys are present and the data aligns correctly.
