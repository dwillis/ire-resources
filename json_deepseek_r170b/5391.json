Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down the input step by step.

First, I see that the tipsheet is titled "Building and telling a bulletproof data story." The authors listed are Tisha Thompson with her email and Twitter handle, and Sandhya Kambhampati with hers as well. Their affiliations are ESPN and ProPublica respectively. 

Next, the conference isn't explicitly mentioned in the input, but since it's from IRE, I can safely assume the conference is "IRE". The year isn't provided, so that field will be "Not Listed".

The tips section includes several bullet points about data story best practices like keeping a data diary, checking for errors, consulting experts, etc. These are crucial points for the description and keywords.

For the JSON structure, I need to include id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is given as 5391. 

The authors array should have each author's name, email, and affiliation. Both Tisha and Sandhya have their emails and affiliations listed, so those can be filled in accordingly.

The description needs to be a concise summary of the tipsheet. It should mention the focus on best practices for ensuring data accuracy and storytelling techniques.

Keywords will include terms like "data story", "accuracy", "best practices", "bulletproofing", and "investigative journalism". These capture the essence without including the conference name or authors.

I also need to make sure all values are in English, enclosed in quotes, and that there's no made-up information. Since the year isn't provided, it remains as "Not Listed".

Putting it all together, I structure each part carefully to ensure compliance with the specified JSON format.
