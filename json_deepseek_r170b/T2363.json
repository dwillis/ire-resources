Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from Ronald Campbell. Let me go through each key step by step.

First, the id should be T2363 as specified. Next, for authors, there's only one author mentioned: Ronald Campbell with an email and affiliation. So the authors list will have one element with his details.

The conference isn't explicitly stated, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed". The year is also not provided in the text, hence it remains "Not Listed".

The title is clearly given as "The Ten Commandments Rules for a (Relatively) Sane Life in CAR". 

For the description, I need to summarize the content. It's about tips for staying sane while doing CAR, so a concise summary would be: "Tips and best practices for managing computer-assisted reporting (CAR) work effectively."

Keywords should include relevant terms without including the conference or authors. The main points are CAR, data journalism, productivity, mental health, and reporting tips.

Putting it all together, I structure each key with appropriate values, ensuring correct formatting and handling cases where information isn't available by using "null" or "Not Listed".
