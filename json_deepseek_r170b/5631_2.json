Okay, so I need to help create a JSON object based on the user's query about steps and costs to publish a book from an IRE conference tipsheet. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, the user provided specific details from the Orlando 2018 conference, including Mary Shanklin's information. The id should be "5631_2". Since there's only one author listed, the authors array will have just her details. Her email and affiliation are both present, so I'll include those.

Next, the conference is clearly stated as IRE ORLANDO CONFERENCE 2018, so the conference key is set to "IRE" and year to 2018. The title should be concise, probably "Steps and Costs to Publish a Book".

For the description, it needs to be a brief summary. Looking at the content, it's about practical steps and costs for self-publishing, including editing, formatting, copyright, etc.

Keywords need to capture the main topics without overlapping with conference or authors. So terms like "self-publishing", "book publishing costs", "ISBN", "formatting", and "promotion" fit well.

I should ensure all keys are in quotes and structure everything correctly without any markdown. Also, make sure no extra text is added beyond the JSON object as per the user's instruction.
