Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided specific instructions, so I'll go through each step carefully.

First, identify the id as 6065. That's straightforward.

Next, extract the authors. The names listed are Beena Raghavendran, Maya Miller, Danielle Ohl, Lulu Ramadan. Their affiliations are ProPublica, Capital Gazette, and The Palm Beach Post. Since emails aren't provided, I'll set them to null.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE 2021, so the year is 2021.

The title of the session is "How to borrow ideas from political campaigns to do your investigations."

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet covers using Google tools like Sheets and Forms, other tools like Bit.ly, best practices for door-knocking, textbotting, and phone banking. So I'll summarize that it's about applying campaign strategies to journalism.

Keywords should include the main topics: political campaigns, investigations, Google tools, door-knocking, textbotting, phone banking. But limit them to five, so I'll exclude any redundant terms.

Putting it all together, ensuring each field is correctly formatted and enclosed in quotes.
