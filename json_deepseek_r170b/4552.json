Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about tools for small newsrooms from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. First, let me go through each part of their instructions step by step.

The id is given as 4552, so that's straightforward. Next, the authors section requires a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. The original text lists several Twitter handles: MeganLuther, grantmeaccess, Act_Rational, AlexSalkever, and Grant Smith with @grantmeaccess. Since there are no full names provided, I'll set each name to null. Affiliations can be taken from the context if available; for example, Grant Smith is associated with a newsroom tool, so his affiliation could be listed as such.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's set. The year isn't mentioned in the text, so it should default to "Not Listed". For the title, I'll extract the main heading, which seems to be about tools for small newsrooms with little or no code required.

In the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet covers various interactive tools and considerations for choosing them, so that's a good basis for a 1-2 sentence overview.

Keywords are next, up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords could be "interactive journalism", "newsroom tools", "data visualization", "media engagement", and "no-code solutions".

I should ensure all values are in English and properly quoted. No made-up names or affiliations, just what's provided or inferred from context.
