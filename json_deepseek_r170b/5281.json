Alright, let me try to work through this query step by step. So, the user provided some detailed information about creating a JSON object from an IRE tipsheet. They want me to generate a response that's only a JSON object based on their specific instructions.

First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. The user wants a tipsheet converted into a structured JSON format with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. Each key has certain requirements.

Looking at the input provided, it's an IRE Tipsheet titled "Starting over: When you move to a new market" by Jon Craig. The content includes various tips for investigative journalists moving to a new area.

Let me break down each required key:

1. **id**: Must be 5281 as specified.
2. **authors**: A list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. Since the author is Jon Craig and his email is provided (JonCraigNY@aol.com), but there's no explicit affiliation mentioned. The tipsheet itself doesn't list an organization, so I'll leave affiliation null.
3. **conference**: The input says it's from an IRE conference, so that's straightforward.
4. **year**: Thereâ€™s no year specified in the text, so it should be "Not Listed".
5. **title**: Taken directly from the tipsheet title provided.
6. **description**: Needs to be a concise 1-2 sentence summary. The main idea is about journalists maintaining their values and instincts when moving markets.
7. **keywords**: Up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords are investigative journalism, public records, source development, media integrity, and government accountability.

I also need to ensure all values are in English unless specified otherwise, which they are here. The structure must be correct with proper quotation marks and syntax.

Now, putting it all together, I'll structure each key with the appropriate values as per the instructions.
