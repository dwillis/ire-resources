Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's instructions from the provided tipsheet. Let me break down the requirements step by step.

First, the id should be 4285 as specified. Now, looking at the authors section, there are three contacts: Anu Narayanaswamy, Sandhya Kambhampati, and Todd Wallack. Each has their name, email, and affiliation. I'll list them in an array with each having their respective details.

Next, the conference is either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Since this tipsheet is from an IRE conference, I'll set it as "IRE".

The year isn't explicitly mentioned, so according to the instructions, I should leave it as "Not Listed".

For the title, the main topic seems to be about investigating universities using key data. So, a suitable title would be "Key Data for Investigating Universities".

The description needs to be a concise summary in simple language. The tipsheet provides various data sources and methods used in the Shadow Campus series on student overcrowding, so I'll mention that.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. The relevant keywords here are "universities", "data journalism", "enrollment", "housing", and "public records".

Putting it all together, each part is addressed, ensuring all keys like id, authors, conference, etc., are correctly filled with the provided data.
