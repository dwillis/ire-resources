Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about the tipsheet from the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided detailed information, so my first step is to parse through that content carefully.

Starting with the id, it's given as 3528, so that part is straightforward. Next, I need to handle the authors section. The main author mentioned is Charles Ornstein from ProPublica. His email and phone number are provided, but since the user specified only name, email, and affiliation, I'll note his affiliation as ProPublica. There's a mention of Tracy Weber, another colleague who spoke at a session, so she should be included in the authors list with her details filled in where possible.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, which stands for Investigative Reporters and Editors, so that goes into the conference field. The year is listed as 2011, so I'll use that value.

For the title, the user provided "Finding Healthcare Stories in Medicare Data," which accurately reflects the content. The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet discusses using Medicare data sources to find healthcare-related stories, so my summary will mention accessing and analyzing data from Hospital Compare, Nursing Home Compare, Physician Compare, Dialysis Facility Compare, and Hospice Compare.

Moving on to keywords, I need up to five relevant terms. From the content, "Medicare data," "healthcare reporting," "Hospital Compare," "Nursing Home Compare," and "data journalism" seem appropriate.

I have to ensure all values are in English and enclosed in quotes. Since the original text is in English, no translation is needed. I'll structure each part carefully, making sure not to include any extra information beyond what's specified.

Finally, I'll double-check that all keys like id, authors, conference, etc., are correctly formatted and that each author entry has the required fields with null where information isn't available.
