Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, the ID is given as 3392, so that's straightforward.

Next, I'll look at the authors. There are three speakers mentioned: Gina Barton, Kristen Lombardi, and Miles Moffeit. Each has their name, email, and affiliation provided, so I can list them all under the "authors" array with their respective details.

The conference location is Las Vegas in 2010, but the main organization is IRE, so the "conference" key should be "IRE". The year is clearly stated as 2010, so that's set.

The title of the tipsheet is “Victims and the Investigative Narrative”.

For the description, it needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet focuses on using a single case study to illustrate investigative findings, emphasizing empathy through detailed storytelling. I'll condense this into one or two sentences.

Keywords should capture the essence without including the conference or authors. Terms like "investigative journalism", "storytelling", "case studies", "narrative structure", and "victim stories" seem appropriate.

Putting it all together, each field is filled accurately based on the information provided.
