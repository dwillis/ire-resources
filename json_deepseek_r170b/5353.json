Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Max Harlow's presentation at an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on the structure, so let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id is fixed as 5353. That's straightforward. 

Next, for authors, the text lists "@maxharlow" with a GitHub handle of "github.com/maxharlow". However, there isn't an explicit name provided, only a username. The instructions say to leave the name null if none is listed and not to make up names. So I'll set name as null. Email and affiliation are also null because they aren't mentioned.

The conference is either IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed. Since the tipsheet refers to the "Nicar schedule" with a link, it's safe to assume this was from the NICAR conference.

For the year, the text doesn't specify when the event took place, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

The title should be clear and descriptive. The presentation is about GitHub for journalists, so that will be the title.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers what GitHub is, its uses like hosting files and collaborating, version control features, how to get files on GitHub, types of files that work well there, and collaboration tools like issues and pull requests. I'll condense this into one or two sentences.

Keywords should be up to five terms related to the content but excluding conference names and authors. Looking through the text, relevant keywords are "GitHub", "version control", "collaboration", "file hosting", and "journalism tools".

I need to ensure all keys and values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes without any markdown formatting.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each key with appropriate values based on the instructions.

```json
{
  "id": 5353,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Github for journalists",
  "description": "This tipsheet explains what Github is, its uses for hosting and collaborating on projects, version control features, and how to get files onto Github. It also covers collaboration tools like issues and pull requests.",
  "keywords": [
    "Github",
    "version control",
    "collaboration",
    "file hosting",
    "journalism tools"
  ]
}
```
