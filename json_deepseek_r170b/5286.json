Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the input provided. Let me go through this step by step.

First, the user has given a chunk of text that's divided into slides from 1 to 13, each discussing various aspects of property tax assessments, methods, and related data journalism tips. The task is to extract specific information from this text to form a JSON object with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The id is given as 5286. That's straightforward.

Next, the authors section should be a list of objects each containing name, email, and affiliation. The user specified not to make up names and to leave them null if none are listed. Looking through the text, I don't see any author names mentioned. The only email provided is Matt.Waite@missouri.edu, but without an associated name. Since there's no explicit author name, each entry in the authors list should have name as null, email as the one found, and affiliation as "University of Missouri" since that's where the email is from.

The conference key needs to be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". The text mentions that the slides are from a NICAR conference. So, conference should be set to "NICAR".

For the year, I don't see any specific mention of the event's year in the provided text. Therefore, year should be "Not Listed" as per instructions.

The title isn't explicitly stated, but looking at the content, it revolves around investigative reporting on property taxes and assessment systems. So a suitable title would be something like "Investigative Reporting on Property Taxes and Assessment Systems".

Description needs to be a concise summary in simple language. The text is about methods for journalists to investigate property tax assessments, so the description should reflect that.

Keywords are up to five terms. From the content, relevant keywords could be "property taxes", "assessment systems", "data journalism", "investigative reporting", and "NICAR".

Putting it all together, each key in the JSON object must be enclosed in quotes, and all values should be in English unless otherwise noted.

I need to make sure that the structure is correct. The authors are an array of objects with name, email, and affiliation. Since there's only one email provided without a name, I'll include just one author entry with null name, the email, and the affiliation as "University of Missouri".

The JSON should look something like this:

{
  "id": 5286,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": "Matt.Waite@missouri.edu",
      "affiliation": "University of Missouri"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigative Reporting on Property Taxes and Assessment Systems",
  "description": "A guide for journalists on investigating property tax assessment systems and methodologies.",
  "keywords": ["property taxes", "assessment systems", "data journalism", "investigative reporting"]
}

Wait, that's four keywords. I can add another if possible. Maybe "NICAR" is already a conference, so perhaps not needed as a keyword. Alternatively, "tax investigations" could be added.

But to keep it at five or fewer, I think the current selection covers the main points without overlapping too much with the conference name.

```json
{
  "id": "5286",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": "Matt.Waite@missouri.edu",
      "affiliation": "University of Missouri"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigative Reporting on Property Taxes and Assessment Systems",
  "description": "A guide for journalists on investigating property tax assessment systems and methodologies.",
  "keywords": ["property taxes", "assessment systems", "data journalism", "investigative reporting"]
}
```
