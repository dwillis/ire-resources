Okay, so I'm trying to help create this JSON object based on the tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id is given as T1577, that's straightforward. 

Next, for authors, there's Jere Downs listed with her email and affiliation at the Philadelphia Inquirer. I'll need to structure this as a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. Since only one author is mentioned, the list will have just one entry.

The conference is NICAR because it mentions NICAR 02 at the top, so that's clear. The year isn't explicitly stated, but given it's NICAR 02, I think that refers to 2002, so the year should be 2002.

The title of the tipsheet seems to be "REPORTING (COMPUTER ASSISTED) ON YOUR BEAT," so I'll use that exactly as it appears.

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet gives advice on using computer-assisted reporting techniques for beat reporting, especially with data and spreadsheets. So maybe something like: "Provides tips and strategies for effectively using computer-assisted reporting techniques to enhance beat reporting."

Keywords should be relevant terms from the content. Looking at the points mentionedâ€”government data, Excel, beat reporting, data analysis, and investigative journalism. I'll list these as keywords without exceeding five.

Putting it all together, I need to structure each part correctly in JSON format, ensuring proper commas and quotation marks. Also, making sure that null values are handled appropriately if any information isn't available, but in this case, everything seems covered.

Here's the structured JSON object based on the provided tipsheet:

```json

  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Jere Downs",
      "email": "jdowns@phillynews.com",
      "affiliation": "Philadelphia Inquirer"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": 2002,
  "title": "REPORTING (COMPUTER ASSISTED) ON YOUR BEAT",
  "description": "Provides tips and strategies for effectively using computer-assisted reporting techniques to enhance beat reporting.",
  "keywords": [
