Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conferences. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id is given as 4692, so that's straightforward.

Next, the authors section. The tipsheet mentions "By Robert Maguire" with his Twitter handle and email. Since there's only one author listed, I'll create an array with a single object. His name is Robert Maguire, his email is robert@crp.org, and his affiliation isn't explicitly stated but since it's from the Center for Responsive Politics (CRP), that will be his affiliation.

The conference is either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". The tipsheet mentions IRE at the top, so conference should be "IRE".

Looking for the year of the event. The text doesn't mention a specific year, so it's "Not Listed".

The title is clearly stated as "Turning a Dark Money ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ into Dark Money (⌐■_■)".

For the description, I need to summarize in 1-2 sentences. The tipsheet provides a checklist for researching dark money groups using various data sources like FEC, IRS, and state records. So, the summary would mention that it's a comprehensive but not exhaustive checklist for investigating dark money by following a fractal-like approach.

Keywords should be no more than five terms related to the content, excluding conference names and authors. The main points are about dark money research, data sources like FEC, IRS, state records, and linkages between groups. So keywords would include "dark money", "research checklist", "FEC data", "IRS data", and "state incorporation records".

Putting it all together, the JSON object should have all these keys with appropriate values.
