Okay, I'm looking at this query where the user wants me to generate a JSON object from a given tipsheet. The id is specified as 2862. First, I need to extract the necessary information.

The authors section: the tipsheet mentions Noemí Ramírez and her affiliation with Diario El Mundo. There's no email provided, so that will be null.

Conference is either IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed. The tipsheet doesn't specify the conference name, so it should be "Not Listed". Similarly, there's no year mentioned, so that field will also be "Not Listed".

For the title and description: the title is clear, "Seguir el rastro de personas: cómo hacerlo en países diferentes". The description needs to be a concise summary. I'll go with something like how investigative journalists in Spanish-speaking countries face challenges due to privacy laws and limited resources.

Keywords should be relevant and no more than five. I'll choose "investigative journalism", "privacy laws", "Spain", "research techniques", and "directory resources".

Putting it all together, making sure each key is correctly formatted and values are enclosed in quotes.
