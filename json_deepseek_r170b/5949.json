Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I'll look for the id. The user specified that it should be 5949, so that's straightforward.

Next are the authors. The tipsheet mentions Steve Eder from The New York Times, with his email provided. Since there's only one author listed, the authors array will have one object. His name is "Steve Eder," and his affiliation is "The New York Times." His email is given as steve.eder@nytimes.com.

Now, the conference is clearly stated as #IRE18, so I'll set the conference key to "IRE". The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the provided text, so according to the instructions, it should be "Not Listed."

For the title, the tipsheet's heading is "What is that politician hiding? And other backgrounding tips." That seems appropriate.

The description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary. I'll condense the main points: strategies for investigating politicians, including organizing research, reviewing public records, and conducting interviews.

Keywords should be up to five terms related to the content but excluding conference names or authors. Relevant terms are "investigative reporting," "political backgrounding," "public records," "interview techniques," and "research organization."

Putting it all together, I structure each key with appropriate values, ensuring everything is in English and properly quoted as per JSON standards.
