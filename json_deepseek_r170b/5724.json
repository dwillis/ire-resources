Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about protecting oneself from trolling or doxxing. The user provided specific tips from Alex Harris at the Miami Herald after the Parkland shooting.

First, I'll parse the input details. The title is clear: "How to protect yourself from trolling (or doxxing)". The author is Alex Harris with an email and affiliation. Since the conference isn't specified in the text, it's marked as "Not Listed". The year is also not given, so that stays as "Not Listed".

Next, for the description, I need a concise summary of the tips. It should mention social media privacy, personal info removal, documenting evidence, and seeking support.

Keywords are limited to five. I'll choose relevant terms like trolling, doxxing, online harassment, social media safety, and journalist safety.

I'll structure all this into the required JSON format with the correct keys and ensure all values are properly enclosed in quotes.
