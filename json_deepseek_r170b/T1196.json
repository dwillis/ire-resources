Alright, I'm trying to create this JSON object based on the user's query. Let me break down what they need.

First, the id is T1196. That's straightforward.

Next, authors should be a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. The text doesn't mention any specific authors, so each author entry will have null for name, email, and affiliation.

Conference needs to be one of "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Since the input text is from 2000 and I don't see any conference mentioned, it should be "Not Listed".

Year is also straightforward. The text refers to the year 2000, so that goes in the year field.

Title is a bit tricky. The user didn't provide one, but looking at the content, it's about police handling of rape cases and investigative tips. So I'll craft a title like "Investigating Police Handling of Rape Cases".

Description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary. It should mention the investigation into police handling of rape cases and provide practical advice for journalists.

Keywords are up to five terms. From the content, relevant keywords would be "police", "rape cases", "investigative journalism", "crime reporting", and "data analysis".

I need to make sure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. No markdown or special formatting, just plain JSON.
