Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let's break this down step by step.

First, looking at the input, the conference is labeled as "National Conference - Phoenix 2017". That tells me it's an IRE event held in 2017. So, the 'conference' key should be "IRE" and the 'year' will be 2017.

Next, the title of the tipsheet is "Digging with Documents", which seems straightforward. 

For the authors, there's Vicky Nguyen listed as a Senior Investigative Reporter/Anchor at NBC Bay Area. Her email is vicky@nbcbayarea.com and her Twitter handle is @VickyNguyenTV. Since her affiliation is clearly stated as NBC Bay Area, I'll include that.

The description needs to be a concise summary of the tipsheet. The main points are using video and audio as documents, enlisting help from others when needed, holding powerful people accountable with physical documents, and utilizing social media footprints for research. So, summarizing this into 1-2 sentences should capture how these strategies aid investigative journalism.

Now, keywords. The important terms here are "document analysis", "video evidence", "social media investigation", "public records", and "investigative reporting". I'll make sure to include no more than five relevant keywords, excluding any that are part of the conference or author names.

Putting it all together, I structure each key accordingly. The id is given as 5186. Each author entry includes name, email, and affiliation. Since there's only one author mentioned, the authors array will have just one object.

I also need to ensure that all values are in English and enclosed in quotes. If any information isn't provided, like another author or specific details, I'll leave those fields as null where applicable.

Finally, double-checking everything to make sure it aligns with the user's instructions and that there are no made-up names or incorrect affiliations.
