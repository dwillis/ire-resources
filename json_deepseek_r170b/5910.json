Okay, so I need to create a JSON object from the given tipsheet about tracking dark money. The user provided specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, the id is given as 5910. That's straightforward.

Next, authors are listed with name, email, and affiliation. There are three authors: Michael Beckel, Anna Massoglia, and Robin Fields. Each has an email and affiliation mentioned right after their names. I'll make sure to list each as separate objects within the authors array.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE 2019", so the conference key will be "IRE" and the year will be 2019.

For the title, the main heading is about tracking dark money tips from IRE 2019. So I'll use that as the title.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The text provides resources for investigating dark money in politics, so the description should reflect that it's a guide with tools and methods.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords would include "dark money", "politics", "investigative reporting", "nonprofits", and "campaign finance".

I'll structure all these into the JSON object as specified, ensuring that each key is correctly named and values are properly formatted.
