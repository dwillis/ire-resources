Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. Let me start by understanding what they provided.

The input includes details from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The title is "Scrape Twitter or Die Tryin’" presented by three authors: Daniel Lathrop, Jacob Harris, and Alasdair Dant. Their affiliations are The Dallas Morning News, The New York Times, and The Guardian respectively.

The user wants a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 3637. 

For the authors array, each entry should have name, email, and affiliation. Since emails aren't provided, they'll be null. Affiliations are clear from the text.

The conference is IRE, but looking at the content, it mentions #NICAR12, which suggests it's a NICAR conference. So I need to set "conference": "NICAR".

The year isn't explicitly stated, so it should be "Not Listed". The title is straightforward: "Scrape Twitter or Die Tryin’".

The description needs to be 1-2 sentences summarizing the tipsheet. It focuses on tools and methods for scraping Twitter data using resources like DataSift, code snippets, and the Miso Project.

Keywords should include relevant terms without including the conference or authors. So, "Twitter", "data scraping", "journalism tools", "Miso Project", and "social media analysis" fit well.

Putting it all together, I structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring each key is correctly populated with the right data.
