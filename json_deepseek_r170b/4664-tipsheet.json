Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from the NICAR '16 conference. Let's break down what each part requires.

First, the id should be "tipsheet". Got that.

Next, authors: There are two listed here, Robert Gebeloff and Tom Johnson. Their emails are provided. For affiliation, since they're from the New York Times and jtjohnson.com respectively, I'll use those as affiliations. So each author entry will have name, email, and affiliation filled in with the appropriate info.

Conference is clearly NICAR, so that's straightforward. The year is 2016 because it's NICAR '16.

The title needs to be a concise summary of the tipsheet content. It focuses on web scraping tools, so I'll go with something like "Web Scraping Tools and Techniques".

Description should be a short summary. Maybe: "Overview of various tools and methods for extracting data from websites without programming."

Keywords are next. They need to be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords would be web scraping, data extraction, online tools, Chrome extensions, Firefox plugins.

Putting it all together in JSON format, making sure each key is properly quoted and values follow the guidelines.
