Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided a detailed structure with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, I'll look at each section of the input to extract the necessary information. 

The title is clearly "On the Beat: Healthcare". The author's name is Chris Weaver, and his contact info shows he's affiliated with The Wall Street Journal (WSJ). His email is provided as christopher.weaver@wsj.com, and his Twitter handle is @cdweaver.

The conference is mentioned as part of an IRE event since the materials link goes to bit.ly/1cDyySH, which is typical for IRE conferences. The year isn't explicitly stated in the text, so I'll set it to "Not Listed".

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet discusses using Medicare data to investigate spending on urine drug tests, so I'll mention that along with the methodologies and sources provided.

Keywords should be relevant and limited to five. They include Medicare data, healthcare spending, urine drug testing, investigative journalism, and data-driven reporting.

Now, structuring all this into a JSON object with appropriate keys and ensuring correct formatting.
