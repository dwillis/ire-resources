Alright, I'm trying to help create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from David Herzog's presentation at the NICAR conference. Let me break down what needs to be done step by step.

First, I'll identify each required key for the JSON object: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as "herzog_mappingthenews". Next, under authors, there's a list where each author should have name, email, and affiliation. From the input, David Herzog is listed with his email and affiliation to Missouri School of Journalism, so that part seems straightforward.

The conference is clearly NICAR since it mentions "#NICAR12" in the resources section. The year isn't explicitly stated, but looking at NICAR events, 2012 makes sense because of the hashtag #NICAR12, so I'll put "2012" for the year.

For the title, it's "Mapping the News". Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The presentation discusses using GIS in journalism to uncover insights through mapping data. So, something like explaining how mapping extends CAR and helps visualize stories would fit.

Keywords should include terms from the content: GIS, Mapping, Data Journalism, Investigative Reporting, CAR (Computer-Assisted Reporting). I'll list these as they are relevant and within the five-term limit.

I need to make sure all values are in English and properly quoted. Since the conference is NICAR, that's one of the allowed options. No other authors are mentioned, so the authors array will only have David Herzog's details.

Putting it all together, I structure each key with its corresponding value, ensuring correct formatting without any markdown as per instructions.
