Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user specified that the response should only be this JSON object without any additional explanation or formatting.

First, I'll parse through the given text to extract the necessary information for each key in the JSON structure: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The ID is straightforward— it's 3948 as provided. The conference is clearly stated as "IRE" since it's from an IRE event in San Antonio on June 20, 2013, so the year is 2013. The title of the tipsheet is "SO, YOU’VE BEEN SUED".

Next, for the authors, there are four speakers listed at the end of the document with their names, email addresses, and affiliations. I'll need to create an array of objects where each object has name, email, and affiliation. Each detail must be accurately captured from the text.

The description should be a concise summary of one or two sentences. The main focus is about how journalists can protect themselves legally when faced with lawsuits, so I'll craft it to reflect that.

For keywords, I need up to five relevant terms excluding the conference name and authors. Looking through the content, terms like "legal protection," "libel," "slander," "defamation," and "anti-SLAPP statutes" are appropriate as they cover the key topics discussed.

I should ensure all values are in English since the source text is in English, and enclose all keys and string values in double quotes. Also, if any information isn't available (like some emails or affiliations), I'll set those fields to null. However, in this case, all authors have their details provided.

Finally, I'll structure everything into a JSON format, making sure it's valid and correctly formatted without any markdown or extra text.
