Okay, I need to help create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, the id is set to 2926 as specified. 

Next, for authors, there are two panelists: Steve Eckert and Renee Ferguson. Their names are provided, but no emails or affiliations beyond their news organizations. So I'll list them with null emails and their respective news orgs as affiliations.

The conference is clearly IRE 2007, so the conference key will be "IRE" and year 2007.

Title should capture the main topic, which seems to be about writing and presenting investigative stories.

For description, it needs a concise summary. The tipsheet covers narrative techniques and storytelling principles, so that's what I'll mention.

Keywords should exclude the conference and authors but include relevant terms like storytelling, investigative journalism, narrative techniques, active voice, and suspense. That makes five keywords, which is within the limit.

I need to structure all this into a JSON object with proper formatting, ensuring all keys are in quotes and values are correctly assigned. I'll avoid any markdown and keep it clean.
