Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet. Let's break down the requirements step by step.

First, the id should be 3497 as given. Next, looking at the authors section. The text mentions "Tipsheet #3497" but doesn't list any specific author names. So each author entry in the list should have name set to null, email and affiliation also null since there's no information provided.

The conference is either IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed. The tipsheet says it's from Tipsheet #3497 presented at an event, but without a clear conference name. It doesn't explicitly mention IRE or NICAR, so I'll go with "Not Listed".

For the year, the input doesn't specify when the event took place. So year is "Not Listed" as well.

The title should be a brief headline. The first line says "Tipsheet #3497", but that's more of an identifier than a title. Looking further down, there's a mention of "Investigative Reporters and Editors" which is the organization, but not the title. Maybe the title can be derived from the content, something like "Investigative Journalism Tipsheet".

The description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. The tipsheet provides tips on investigative reporting methods, sources, and tools. So I'll summarize that it offers advice and resources for journalists.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Relevant keywords here could be "investigative journalism", "reporting tips", "journalism tools", "sources", and "research methods".

Now, putting all this together into a JSON object with proper structure.

```json
{
  "id": "3497",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigative Journalism Tipsheet",
  "description": "A tipsheet offering advice and resources for investigative journalists on methods, sources, and tools.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative journalism",
    "reporting tips",
    "journalism tools",
    "sources",
    "research methods"
  ]
}
```
