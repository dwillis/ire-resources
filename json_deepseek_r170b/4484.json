Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. The input provided is from an IRE conference tipsheet by Cheryl W. Thompson. 

First, let me parse the details. The conference is IRE 2015 in Philadelphia, so the year is 2015 and conference is "IRE". The title of the tipsheet is about strategies for covering criminal justice.

Looking at the author section: Cheryl W. Thompson's name, email, and affiliation are all present. So the authors array will have one object with her details filled out.

The description needs to be a concise summary. I'll focus on the key points she made: developing sources, looking for crime trends, ridealongs, and reviewing documents like budgets and audits.

For keywords, I need up to five terms related to the content. Criminal justice reporting, police accountability, investigative journalism, source building, and crime trends fit well.

I must ensure all keys are in quotes and values correctly formatted. Also, avoid any markdown as per instructions.
