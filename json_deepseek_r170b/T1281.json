Okay, so I need to create a JSON object from the given input with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. Let's break this down step by step.

First, looking at the input provided, it seems like each entry is a different story or investigation with details about the authors and their affiliations. For example, the first one mentions "IRE 200" but I don't see a specific year listed anywhere in the text. The conference isn't explicitly mentioned either; it's just part of the initial input.

The task specifies that the id should be T1281, which is straightforward. Now, for the authors, each entry has names and sometimes emails or affiliations. For instance, "Tony Kovaleski" from KPRC-TV in Houston. But some entries might not have all details, so I'll need to leave those fields as null if they're missing.

The description needs to be a concise summary in simple language. I'll have to read each entry and paraphrase the main point without getting too detailed. Keywords should be up to five terms that capture the essence of each story, excluding the conference name and authors.

I also notice that some entries mention the same people, like "Tony Kovaleski" appearing multiple times with different stories. I'll need to create separate author objects for each instance but make sure they're correctly associated with their respective titles and descriptions.

Another thing is handling cases where there's no email or affiliation provided. In those cases, I should set those fields to null. Also, if a news organization is mentioned without an explicit author name, I can use that as the affiliation for authors whose names are listed.

Since the conference isn't specified beyond "IRE" and "NICAR," but in this case, it's just labeled as "IRE 200," which seems like it might be a typo or shorthand. But since the user didn't specify, I'll go with "Not Listed" for the conference unless told otherwise.

The year is also tricky because it's not clearly mentioned. Each entry doesn't have a date, so I'll set the year to "Not Listed" as per instructions.

Finally, compiling all this into a JSON structure requires careful attention to syntax and ensuring that each key is correctly formatted with quotes around string values and proper comma placement.

  "id": "T1281",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "IRE"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "IRE 200",
  "description": "A collection of investigative reports from IRE 200, covering various topics such as charity misconduct, telemarketing scams, and issues within the VA system.",
  "keywords": ["charity", "telemarketing scam", "VA system", "golf club scam", "Feed the Children"]
}
```
