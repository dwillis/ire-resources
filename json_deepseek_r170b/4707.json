Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The user provided a detailed document outline with various sections like automation services, email alerting services, bot hosting, etc.

First, I'll parse through each section to extract relevant information. The title of the tipsheet is "The Bot Emporium." The author listed is Justin Myers, and his Twitter handle is provided. Since there's no email or affiliation mentioned, those will be null in the JSON.

Next, the conference is NICAR 2016, as indicated by the hashtag #nicar16 and the mention of sessions at that event. So, the conference key will be "NICAR" and the year is 2016.

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet covers tools and resources for building bots and automation in newsrooms, so I'll phrase it to reflect that.

Keywords should include terms like "Automation," "Bots," "Newsroom Tools," "Journalism Technology," and "NICAR16." These capture the essence without including the conference or author names.

I need to structure all this into a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The ID is given as 4707, so that's straightforward.

Finally, I'll ensure that each value is correctly formatted, using null where information isn't available and keeping the language simple.

  "id": 4707,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Justin Myers",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": 2016,
  "title": "The Bot Emporium",
  "description": "A tipsheet from the NICAR 2016 conference covering tools and resources for building bots and automation in newsrooms.",
  "keywords": [
    "Automation",
    "Bots",
    "Newsroom Tools",
    "Journalism Technology",
    "NICAR16"
  ]
