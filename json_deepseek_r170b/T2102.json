Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given query. The user wants this for an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet from June 2004 in Atlanta.

First, the id is T2102 as specified. Next, authors are listed with name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the input, I see Chris Waddle, Christopher H. Schmitt, and Pete Weitzel mentioned. Their emails and affiliations are provided, so I can fill those in without issues.

The conference is clearly IRE, held in Atlanta, GA, so that's straightforward. The year is 2004 since it's stated as June 2004. 

For the title, the main heading is "ATTACKS ON FREEDOM OF INFORMATION AND HOW TO FIGHT BACK," which I'll use exactly.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet provides resources and guidance on using FOIA and similar state laws, so I'll phrase it simply.

Keywords should include Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), government transparency, access to information, journalism resources, and open government. These are relevant without including the conference or authors.

I need to ensure all keys are in quotes and values are properly formatted. No markdown, just a clean JSON structure.
