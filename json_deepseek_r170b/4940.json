Okay, so I need to help this user by creating a JSON object based on their provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through the details step by step.

First, the id is given as 4940, that's straightforward. Next, authors: Diana B. Henriques and Michelle Leder are listed. I notice Michelle is affiliated with footnoted.com, so her affiliation is clear. Diana doesn't have an explicit affiliation mentioned here, so I'll leave it null. Both have their emails provided in the text.

The conference is IRE, which is one of the specified options. The year is 2017 as per the workshop date. The title is "Understanding Financial Documents," and the description needs to be a concise summary. I'll go with something like how to analyze SEC filings for investigative journalism.

For keywords, I'll pick relevant terms from the content: SEC Filings, 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, Proxy Statement. These are all key documents discussed in the tipsheet and fit within five items.

I should ensure that all keys and values are enclosed in quotes, and everything is in English as per instructions. I'll structure it properly without any markdown.
