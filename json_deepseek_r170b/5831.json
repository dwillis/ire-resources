Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON.

First, I'll start by identifying each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

The id is given as 5831. So that's straightforward.

Next, for the authors section, I see Tyson Weister listed with his affiliation as the Center for Enterprise Dissemination (CED) at the U.S. Census Bureau. There's no email provided, so I'll leave that null.

Conference should be "IRE" since this is from an IRE event.

The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the text, so it remains "Not Listed".

The title of the tipsheet is "Life After FactFinder: The Future of data.census.gov".

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet discusses the replacement of American FactFinder with a new platform, data.census.gov, highlighting features like improved search and navigation. So the description should capture that in 1-2 sentences.

Keywords are next. I'll extract relevant terms: "Census Bureau", "data.census.gov", "American FactFinder", "API access", and "data dissemination". These are all central to the content.

Putting it all together, ensuring each field is correctly formatted with quotes and proper structure.
