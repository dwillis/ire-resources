Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to create the JSON object from the given input based on the user's instructions. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the user provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference in June 2003. The author is Natalya Shulyakovskaya, affiliated with The Orange County Register, and her contact information is included.

I need to structure this into a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

1. **id**: It should be "T1936" as specified.
2. **authors**: This is a list of objects. Each author has name, email, and affiliation. The user mentioned not to make up names and to use the news organization as affiliation if available. Here, Natalya's name is provided along with her email and affiliation (The Orange County Register), so that goes into the authors array.
3. **conference**: The tipsheet mentions IRE/June 2003, so conference is "IRE".
4. **year**: Clearly listed as 2003.
5. **title**: It's given as "International Data".
6. **description**: Needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about Russian governmental databases used by the author and their applications and limitations. So I'll craft a 1-2 sentence summary capturing that essence.
7. **keywords**: Up to five terms, excluding conference and authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords could be "Russian databases", "governmental data", "investigative reporting", "company registration", "export-import data".

I have to ensure all values are in English unless the original isn't, but here everything is in English. Also, all keys and string values must be enclosed in quotes.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part carefully, making sure not to include any extra information beyond what's specified.
