Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to create this JSON object based on the user's query. They provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user wants me to extract specific information and structure it into a JSON format with certain keys.

First, I need to identify the id, which is given as 5599. That part is straightforward. Next, the authors section should be a list where each author has a name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the text, Brendan Keefe is listed as the Chief Investigator at 11Alive Atlanta. His contact information includes an email and phone number, so I'll include the email but set the phone number to null since it's not required.

The conference is clearly labeled as IRE, so that goes into the conference key. The year isn't mentioned anywhere in the provided text, so I'll default to "Not Listed". For the title, I see "SHOW ME DON’T TELL ME!" which seems to be the main heading, and then a subtitle about turning data into TV gold. Combining these gives me a clear title.

The description needs to summarize the content in 1-2 sentences. The tipsheet focuses on using data and documents effectively in storytelling for television and online platforms. So I'll write something concise that captures that essence.

Keywords are next, up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Terms like "data journalism," "tv investigative reporting," "document analysis," "visual storytelling," and "investigative techniques" seem relevant here.

Putting it all together, I structure each part into the JSON format as specified, making sure all keys and values are in quotes and properly formatted.
