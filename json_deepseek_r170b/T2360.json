Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The user provided specific instructions, so I'll have to carefully parse each part.

First, the id is given as T2360. That's straightforward.

Next are the authors. Looking at the text, Janet Lundblad from the Los Angeles Times is mentioned. There's also a book by Richard S. Johnson and Debra Johnson Knox, but since they're authors of a book, not the tipsheet itself, I think only Janet should be listed as the author here. Her email and affiliation aren't provided, so those will be null.

The conference location is Los Angeles, California, on March 18, 2005. So the conference key is NICAR because it's the NICAR National Conference.

The title of the tipsheet is "Finding Military Personnel and Their Survivors," which I'll use as the title in the JSON.

For the description, I need a concise summary. The text talks about resources for locating military personnel using Social Security numbers, directories, archives, websites, and tips like spreadsheets. So I'll summarize that it's about resources and methods to find military individuals and survivors.

Keywords are next. They should be no more than five terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, suitable keywords could be "military personnel," "locator services," "public records," "investigative research," and "Social Security numbers."

Putting it all together, I'll structure each key as per instructions. I have to make sure all values are in English and enclosed in quotes.
