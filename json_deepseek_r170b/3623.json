Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let's break down the requirements step by step.

First, the id is specified as 3623, so that's straightforward. The authors section should be a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the input, there's a section about Ben Welsh who works for the Data Desk at latimes.com. His Twitter handle is @palewire, but no email is provided. So his entry will have name: "Ben Welsh", email: null, and affiliation: "Los Angeles Times".

Next, the conference is IRE since it's from an IRE conference tipsheet. The year isn't explicitly mentioned, so I'll set it to "Not Listed". 

The title should be the main theme of the tipsheet. The input starts with "Locating the story" and "The latest in online maps", so combining those makes sense for the title.

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet discusses alternatives to Google Maps, including using OpenStreetMap, HTML5, and tools like TileMill and Leaflet. It also mentions Fusion Tables and examples from WNYC. So a brief summary would cover escaping Google Maps costs by using these alternatives.

Keywords are up to five terms. From the content, relevant keywords include "Google Maps", "OpenStreetMap", "HTML5", "TileMill", and "Leaflet".

Putting it all together, I structure each part accordingly, ensuring that strings are properly quoted and the JSON syntax is correct.

```json
{
  "id": 3623,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Ben Welsh",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Los Angeles Times"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Locating the Story: The Latest in Online Maps",
  "description": "This tipsheet discusses alternatives to Google Maps, including OpenStreetMap, HTML5 maps, and tools like TileMill and Leaflet. It also covers Fusion Tables and examples of map usage from WNYC.",
  "keywords": [
    "Google Maps",
    "OpenStreetMap",
    "HTML5",
    "TileMill",
    "Leaflet"
  ]
}
```
