Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with certain keys like id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. 

First, let me parse through the document. The tipsheet is about customizing Chartbuilder for news organizations, presented by Lindsey Cook from US News & World Report at NICAR16 in 2016. That gives me the conference as "NICAR" and the year as 2016.

Next, the title should reflect the main topic, which is customizing Chartbuilder. The description needs to be a concise summary of what the tipsheet coversâ€”essentially how to tailor Chartbuilder for news orgs by adjusting fonts, colors, adding logos, etc., so it fits their brand.

For authors, Lindsey Cook is listed with her affiliation as US News & World Report. There's no email provided, so that field can be null. 

Keywords should include terms like "Chartbuilder", "customization", "branding", and maybe "news design" since those are central to the tipsheet.

I need to make sure all keys are in quotes and the structure follows proper JSON syntax. Also, each value should be a string unless it's an array or null. The authors should be an array of objects with name, email, and affiliation.

Putting this together step by step, ensuring I don't miss any fields and that everything is correctly formatted.
