Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's input following their specific instructions. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the input provided, it seems to be a detailed document about intelligence and security, including various sections like terrorist organizations, where to find profiles, support websites, and examples of stories. The user wants this converted into a JSON object with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The id should be T1963. Since the input doesn't mention any authors, the authors list will have elements with name null and email and affiliation as null.

Next, the conference key needs to be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". I don't see any indication of a conference in the text, so it should default to "Not Listed".

The year isn't provided anywhere in the input, so that will also be "Not Listed".

For the title, I need something that captures the essence. The document seems to focus on intelligence and security, so I'll go with "Intelligence and Security: Resources and Profiles".

The description should be a concise summary. Since the text covers resources for journalists on terrorist organizations and intelligence agencies, I can write it as a guide for journalists.

Now, keywords. They need to be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking through the content, relevant keywords are "Intelligence", "Security", "Terrorism", "Journalism Resources", and "Extremist Groups".

Putting this all together, I'll structure the JSON accordingly with each key properly enclosed in quotes and the correct data types.

```json
{
  "id": "T1963",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Intelligence and Security: Resources and Profiles",
  "description": "A guide for journalists covering intelligence, security, and terrorism, including resources, profiles of terrorist organizations, and story ideas.",
  "keywords": [
    "Intelligence",
    "Security",
    "Terrorism",
    "Journalism Resources",
    "Extremist Groups"
  ]
}
```
