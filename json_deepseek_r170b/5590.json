Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down each step carefully.

First, looking at the structure required: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is 5590 as specified. 

For the authors section, it's a list of elements with name, email, and affiliation. I need to extract this from the tipsheet. At the end of the document, thereâ€™s a contact: Sophie Cocke from Honolulu Star-Advertiser with her email scocke@staradvertiser.com. So that will be one author entry.

Next, the conference is clearly stated as IRE since it's from an Investigative Reporters and Editors event. The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the text, so I'll default to "Not Listed".

The title of the tipsheet is "Tip Sheet for prying loose public records". 

For the description, I need a concise 1-2 sentence summary. The main points are strategies to obtain public records, dealing with costs and delays, and using resources like UIPA.org.

Keywords should be up to five relevant terms: Public Records, Government Transparency, Journalism, Open Records Law, Hawaii.

I'll structure all these into the JSON format as specified.

```json

  "id": 5590,

    {
      "name": "Sophie Cocke",
      "email": "scocke@staradvertiser.com",
      "affiliation": "Honolulu Star-Advertiser"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Tip Sheet for prying loose public records",
  "description": "Strategies and resources for journalists to effectively request and obtain public records, including dealing with costs, delays, and using tools like UIPA.org.",
  "keywords": ["Public Records", "Government Transparency", "Journalism", "Open Records Law", "Hawaii"]
}
```
