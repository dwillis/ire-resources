Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given query and the input provided. Let me go through this step by step.

First, the user wants a JSON with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. Each key has its own requirements.

Looking at the input, it's a detailed presentation about creating map graphics for video, presented at an event. The speaker is Michael Corey from the Center for Investigative Reporting, and his email is mcorey@cironline.org. His affiliation is clear as CIR.

The conference isn't explicitly mentioned in the text provided, but given that it's from a journalism context and mentions IRE in the example JSON, I'll assume the conference is "IRE".

The year is 2012, as seen in the sample output provided by the user (IRE_CAR_2012).

For the title, the presentation seems to focus on "Map Graphics for Video," so that's straightforward.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The presentation covers using GIS data in video graphics, so I'll phrase it to reflect that.

Keywords should include terms like mapping, GIS, After Effects, etc., up to five terms.

Putting this all together, I need to structure each part correctly, ensuring no made-up names and proper formatting.

```json
{
  "id": "IRE_CAR_2012_Map_graphics_for_video",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2012,
  "title": "Map Graphics for Video",
  "description": "A presentation on creating map graphics for video using GIS data and design tools like Adobe After Effects.",
  "keywords": [
    "mapping",
    "GIS",
    "After Effects",
    "video graphics"
  ]
}
```
