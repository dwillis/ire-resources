Alright, I need to help the user by creating a JSON object based on their query. They provided detailed information from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet about immigration data. The user wants this transformed into a specific JSON structure with keys like id, authors, conference, etc.

First, I'll identify each required field:

1. **id**: Given as 5415.
2. **authors**: They mentioned Angilee Shah with her email and affiliation to PRI's Global Nation. Since only one author is listed, the array will have one object.
3. **conference**: It's specified as "IRE" since it's from the IRE conference.
4. **year**: The event took place in 2018, so year is 2018.
5. **title**: The title is "Finding the Story: Immigration data".
6. **description**: Needs to be a concise summary of the session. It focused on using immigration datasets for journalism stories despite challenges in accessing the data under different administrations.
7. **keywords**: Relevant terms like "immigration", "data journalism", "transparency", "public records", and "government accountability".

I should ensure all values are correctly formatted, especially the authors' details. Also, make sure that the description is clear and within 1-2 sentences as per instructions.

Now, I'll structure this information into a JSON object, making sure to use proper syntax with quotes around keys and string values.
