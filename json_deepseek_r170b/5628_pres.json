Okay, so I'm trying to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from the IRE Conference 2018. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id needs to be "5628_pres". That's straightforward.

Next, authors. There are three presenters: Jamie Grey, Jake Bleiberg, and Kristin Hussey. Each should have a name, email, and affiliation. 

- For Jamie Grey, the email is jgrey@raycommedia.com and the affiliation is Raycom Media.
- Jake Bleiberg's email is jbleiberg@bangordailynews.com, affiliated with Bangor Daily News.
- Kristin Hussey's email is khussey1@gmail.com, but her affiliation isn't explicitly mentioned next to her name. However, under "Our Contact Info," she's listed as a Freelance Journalist in Connecticut. So I should use that as her affiliation.

Conference is clearly stated as IRE Conference 2018, so the conference key will be "IRE" and the year is 2018.

The title of the tipsheet is "One Journalist, Multiple Hats".

For the description, it's a one to two-sentence summary. The tipsheet covers how journalists can handle multiple roles, including reporting, photography, and data management while working alone. So I'll summarize that concisely.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking through the content, relevant keywords are "investigative journalism", "freelance reporting", "mobile journalism tools", "data stockpiling", and "fact-checking".

I think that covers all the necessary parts without missing anything.
