Alright, I need to create a JSON object from the provided tipsheet. The user has specific instructions on what keys to include: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, the id is given as 4814. That's straightforward.

Next, for authors, there's Eric Flack listed with his email and affiliation at WAVE 3 News. I'll structure this as an array of objects, each with name, email, and affiliation. Since only one author is present, it will be a single-element array.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE 2016, so the conference key is "IRE" and the year is 2016.

The title is provided as "Investigating Your Local School System". 

For the description, I need to summarize the tipsheet in 1-2 sentences. The main points are about using FERPA correctly, looking beyond classrooms for stories like athletics, and national trends impacting local systems. So the summary should capture these ideas concisely.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Relevant keywords from the content include "FERPA", "school system investigation", "student privacy", "education reporting", and "local journalism".

Putting it all together, I'll structure each key appropriately with their values, ensuring correct data types and formatting.
