Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, the id is straightforward; it's given as 4215. Next, authors: looking at the text, there are mentions of Duff Wilson in the context of a guide they provided. So I'll list Duff Wilson as an author. Since no email or affiliation is mentioned for him, those fields will be null.

The conference is clearly stated to be IRE. The year isn't explicitly mentioned anywhere in the text, so it should default to "Not Listed".

For the title, the tipsheet starts with a question about digging up information on people, so a suitable title would be "Digging Up Information on People: Techniques and Resources."

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet offers techniques for finding people, verifying info, and uncovering online presence, so I'll phrase it as a 1-2 sentence overview of that.

Keywords should be relevant and limited to five. From the content, "investigative reporting," "people search," "public records," "online research," and "backgrounding" seem appropriate.

I have to ensure all keys are in English and properly quoted. I'll structure each part accordingly without adding any made-up information.
