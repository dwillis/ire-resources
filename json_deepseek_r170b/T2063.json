Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The input provided includes details from Mark Katches of The Orange County Register regarding their investigation into lead contamination in Mexican candy.

First, I'll extract the relevant information. The ID is given as T2063, so that goes straight in. For authors, there's only one person mentioned: Mark Katches with his email and affiliation to The Orange County Register. Since it's an IRE conference, the conference key will be "IRE". The year isn't provided, so I'll set it to "Not Listed".

The title of the tipsheet is "Testing as an Investigative Technique". Now, for the description, I need a concise summary in 1-2 sentences. It should mention their investigation into Mexican candy lead levels and the testing methods they used.

Next, keywords are important. I'll pick relevant terms like "lead contamination", "Mexican candy", "product testing", "investigative journalism", and "public health". These capture the essence without including the conference or authors.

I need to make sure all keys are in quotes and that the structure follows proper JSON formatting. No markdown, just plain text with correct syntax. I should avoid any additional explanations or markdown elements as per the user's request.

Finally, I'll double-check each field to ensure accuracy: ID, authors' details, conference type, year, title, description, and keywords all properly encapsulated within a JSON structure.
