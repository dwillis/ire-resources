Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given me specific instructions about what each key should contain.

First, the id is straightforward: it's 5621 as per their request.

Next, for authors, they have listed Ziva Branstetter, Adam Playford, and Tyler Dukes with their affiliations and Twitter handles. I need to structure this as a list of objects, each containing name, email, and affiliation. Emails aren't provided, so those will be null. Affiliations are clear from the text: Reveal, Tampa Bay Times, and WRAL.

The conference is IRE since that's mentioned at the top. The year isn't specified in the input, so it'll be "Not Listed".

For the title, the main focus seems to be on avoiding failures in investigations. So a suitable title would be "Avoiding Common Failures in Investigative Reporting."

Description needs to be concise: maybe something about preventing mistakes through preparation and fact-checking.

Keywords should capture the essence without listing the authors or conference. Terms like investigation, fact checking, credibility, data errors, transparency make sense here.

Putting it all together, I structure each part carefully, ensuring no made-up names are used and everything is in English as required.
