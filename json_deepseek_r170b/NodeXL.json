Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided a detailed document about using NodeXL for network analysis at NICAR 2013 in Louisville.

First, I'll start by identifying each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. 

The 'id' is straightforward; it's given as "NodeXL". 

Next, the 'authors' section needs to be a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. In the document, only one author is mentioned: Peter A. Gloor from the MIT Sloan School of Management. So I'll include him with his details.

The 'conference' is clearly stated as NICAR, so that's easy. The year is 2013 since it was held in March of that year.

For the title, it should reflect the content accurately. The document focuses on network analysis using NodeXL at the NICAR conference, so a suitable title would be "Hands-On Network Analysis with NodeXL".

The description needs to be a concise summary. I'll mention that the tipsheet covers practical steps for analyzing social media and political networks using NodeXL.

Keywords should include relevant terms without repeating the obvious ones like the tool name or the conference. So I'll go with 'network analysis', 'social media', and 'political networks'.

Putting it all together, I structure each part correctly, ensuring proper formatting and enclosing strings in quotes.
