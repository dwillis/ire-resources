Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given input using specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The user provided detailed instructions, so let's break it down step by step.

First, the id is set to 2990 as per the instruction. 

Next, looking at the input, Scott A. Zamost is listed with his email and affiliation. So, authors will be a list containing one object with name "Scott A. Zamost", email "scott.zamost@nbc.com", and affiliation "WTVJ-TV/NBC 6". No other authors are mentioned, so the list has only one entry.

The conference isn't explicitly mentioned in the input text provided. The user's example shows it as "IRE", but since there's no clear reference here, I think it should be set to "Not Listed".

For the year, again, the input doesn't specify when the event took place. So, year is also "Not Listed".

The title of the tipsheet is clearly given as "The Time Squeeze: Getting On Air and Getting There Fast". That's straightforward.

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary in 1-2 sentences. The input talks about techniques for producing shorter investigative pieces while maintaining strong focus, so I'll capture that essence without getting too detailed.

Keywords are next. From the content, relevant terms include "investigative journalism", "time management", "storytelling", "multi-part series", and "character development". These cover the main points discussed.

I need to ensure all keys are strings and properly quoted. Also, avoid making up any data; if it's not present, leave it as null or "Not Listed".

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with each key filled appropriately based on the above analysis.

```json
{
  "id": 2990,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Scott A. Zamost",
      "email": "scott.zamost@nbc.com",
      "affiliation": "WTVJ-TV/NBC 6"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "The Time Squeeze: Getting On Air and Getting There Fast",
  "description": "A tipsheet on techniques for producing shorter investigative pieces while maintaining strong focus and storytelling.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative journalism",
    "time management",
    "storytelling"
  ]
}
```
