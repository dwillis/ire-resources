Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id is specified as "4088_Part_4". So that's straightforward.

Looking at the authors section, Nikole Hannah-Jones is listed with her email and Twitter handle. Since she's affiliated with ProPublica, I'll note that as her affiliation. There are no other authors mentioned, so the list will have only one entry.

The conference is clearly stated as the 2014 IRE Computer-Assisted Reporting Conference, so the conference key will be "IRE" and the year is 2014. The title of the tipsheet is "Investigating Racial Inequality".

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet covers various aspects of racial inequality using data analysis, legal frameworks, and case studies. So the description should reflect that it's about investigating racial inequality through data and legal context.

Keywords are next. The main topics covered include racial inequality, segregation, fair housing, disparate impact theory, and residential segregation. I'll list these as keywords, making sure not to exceed five terms.

I need to structure all of this into a JSON object with the specified keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. Ensuring that each value is correctly formatted, especially the authors array which contains objects with name, email, and affiliation.

Double-checking that all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, making sure that the JSON syntax is correct to avoid any errors.
