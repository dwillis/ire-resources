Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, I'll start by identifying each piece of information needed for these keys. The id is straightforwardâ€”it's 5740 as per the user's request. Next, looking at the authors section, I need to extract names, emails, and affiliations. From the text, I can see Tina Rosenberg, Perla Trevizo, Meg Kissinger are the speakers. Their emails and affiliations are provided, so I'll include those.

The conference is mentioned as part of IRE, so that's set. The year isn't explicitly stated in the text, so I'll default to "Not Listed". The title of the tipsheet is clearly given as "Adding solutions journalism to make your investigation stronger".

For the description, I need a concise summary of what this session covers. It's about integrating solutions journalism into investigative reporting to enhance accountability and provide practical examples from case studies.

Keywords should be relevant terms related to the topic but excluding the conference name and authors' names. So, "solutions journalism", "investigative reporting", "accountability", "case studies" fit well here.

I also need to ensure that all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Each key and value must follow the specified structure without any markdown formatting as per the user's request.
