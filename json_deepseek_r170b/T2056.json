Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, I'll look for the ID. The example shows it's T2056, so that's straightforward.

Next, the authors section should be a list of objects each containing name, email, and affiliation. In the input, John Archibald is listed as the database editor from The Birmingham News with his contact info. So I'll include him in the authors array with his details. There are no other authors mentioned, so that's it.

The conference is clearly stated as 2004 IRE National Conference, so the value here is "IRE".

For the year, it's given as 2004, so that goes into the year field.

The title of the tipsheet is "Behind the Criminal Justice Veil".

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about using data and statistics to investigate beyond typical crime stories, focusing on systemic issues in the criminal justice system. So I'll craft a 1-2 sentence summary capturing that essence.

Keywords should be no more than five terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords could be "crime reporting", "criminal justice", "data journalism", "police accountability", and "investigative techniques".

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly quoted. No markdown or extra text, just a clean JSON object.

Double-checking each field:
- id: T2056
- authors: Only John Archibald with his email and affiliation.
- conference: IRE
- year: 2004
- title: Correct as provided.
- description: Clear and concise summary.
- keywords: Five relevant terms.

I think that covers everything the user asked for. Time to put it all together in JSON format.
