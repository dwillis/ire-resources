Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The id should be 5433 as specified. 

Looking at the input, Jodi Upton is listed as the Knight Chair at Syracuse University, so she's definitely one of the authors. There are no other names provided, so I'll only include her in the authors list with her affiliation and leave email null since it's not given.

The conference mentioned is NICAR 2018 in Chicago, so the conference key will be "NICAR" and the year is 2018. 

For the title, the main topic seems to be who's investigating college sports, so I'll use that as the title.

In the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about NCAA infractions and a bribery scandal involving multiple schools, along with financial data on athletics revenues and coaching salaries. So I can write something like: "Overview of NCAA investigations into college sports infractions, including data on school penalties and financial aspects of athletic programs."

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. The key points here are NCAA infractions, bribery scandal, college sports, athletics revenues, and coaching salaries. That makes five relevant keywords.

Putting it all together, I structure the JSON with the specified keys, ensuring all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes.
