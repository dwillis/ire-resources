Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. Let me start by understanding exactly what they're asking for. They want an object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, the id is given as 5073, so that's straightforward. Next, the authors should be a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. I notice in the text there are several tip sheets mentioned with names like Jacob Fenton, Jeremey Singer Vine, Tyler Dukes, Cheryl Phillips, Manuel Aristaran, Jeremy B Merril, Mike Tigas, Jeff Porter, Kevin Schaul, John Perry, Chris Milholland. However, for each of these, I need to see if they have emails or affiliations listed.

Looking through the text, I don't see any email addresses provided, so those will be null. Affiliations might be tricky too because only some are mentioned alongside their names. For example, Manuel Aristaran is affiliated with a news organization, but others like Jacob Fenton are from journalism backgrounds without specific organizations listed. Since the user instructed to use the news organization as affiliation if none is provided next to the name, I'll apply that where possible.

The conference key needs to be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". All the tip sheets mentioned are from IRE resources, so the conference should be "IRE".

For the year, I need to check if any of these tip sheets have a clear event year. The URLs provided don't show years, and there's no mention in the text, so I'll set it as "Not Listed".

The title is the name of each tip sheet, which are listed in the text. Each has its own title, like "Parsing Prickly PDFs" by Jacob Fenton and Jeremey Singer Vine.

The description must be a concise summary of each tip sheet's content. I'll need to write that based on the context given. For example, one is about parsing PDFs with Python, another discusses extracting data from PDFs, etc.

Keywords should be no more than five terms related to each topic, excluding the conference and authors. So terms like "PDF", "data extraction", "Python", "journalism tools" would fit.

Now, I'll structure this information into a JSON object as per the instructions. Each author entry will have name, email (null), and affiliation if possible. Since no emails are provided, they remain null. Affiliations are only added where a news organization is mentioned.

I think that's all. Let me put it together step by step to ensure I don't miss any details.
