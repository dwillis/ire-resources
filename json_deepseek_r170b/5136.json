Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the tipsheet provided. The user has given specific instructions, so I'll go through each part step by step.

First, the id is fixed at 5136. Got it.

Next, authors. There's only one author listed: Michael Vasquez with a Twitter handle @MrMikeVasquez. Since there’s no email or affiliation mentioned, those will be null.

The conference isn't explicitly stated in the text. It mentions IRE conferences in the initial part, so the conference should be "IRE".

For the year, looking at the content, it doesn’t specify when the event took place. So I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

The title is clear: "Navigating Roadblocks in Higher Education Records".

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary of 1-2 sentences. The tipsheet talks about overcoming resistance from public universities and using various strategies like FOIA requests and sources. I'll condense that into a simple summary.

Keywords should be up to five terms related to the content. I'll pick "FERPA", "FOIA", "public records", "higher education", and "investigative reporting".

Putting it all together, ensuring each key is properly quoted and values are correctly formatted.
