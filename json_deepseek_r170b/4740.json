Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. I'm dealing with three spreadsheets from 2013 and 2014 that contain data on states and counties, specifically focusing on Medicare Advantage (MA) penetration rates. The goal is to add a column in the 2014 sheet that pulls in the MA participation rate from 2013 using VLOOKUP.

First, I need to prepare the spreadsheets for merging. The user mentioned renaming the tabs to "2013" and "2014" because Excel might have issues with spaces in tab names. So, I'll go ahead and rename them accordingly.

Next, there's a step about unmerging cells. Merged cells can cause problems when sorting or using functions like VLOOKUP, so I need to highlight all rows in each sheet and click "Unmerge Cells" under the Home tab. This ensures that every cell is individual and sortable without issues.

After that, I have to delete Row 1 on both sheets because we want the headers to start at the top. This makes it easier to work with the data and avoids any confusion with blank or extra rows.

Now, creating a unique ID field is crucial for VLOOKUP to work correctly. The existing "State and County FIPS" column has some entries with ".", which likely represent state or national averages. Since these aren't unique identifiers, I need another way to uniquely identify each row. The solution suggested is to create a new column called "New state and county fips." 

In this new column, I'll use an IF statement: =IF(D2=".", B2&" "&C2, D2). This formula checks if the value in cell D2 (which contains the FIPS code) is ".", indicating a non-unique entry. If it is, the formula concatenates cells B2 and C2 (which I assume are State and County names or codes) to create a unique identifier. Otherwise, it just uses the existing FIPS code.

I'll apply this formula down the entire column in both sheets and then copy and paste them as values to remove the formulas, leaving only the unique IDs.

Once that's done, I'm ready to set up the VLOOKUP function. In the 2014 sheet, next to the "MA Participation Rate" column (column H), I'll add a new column labeled "MA Participation Rate 2013." 

In cell I2 of this new column, I'll enter the formula: =VLOOKUP(A2, 2013!A$1:I$J3192,8,FALSE). Here's what each part does:
- A2 is the unique ID in the 2014 sheet.
- 2013!A$1:I$J3192 refers to the range of data in the 2013 sheet. The dollar signs ensure that when I copy the formula down, it doesn't change references relative to the row.
- 8 specifies that I want to pull data from the eighth column in the 2013 sheet, which corresponds to the MA Participation Rate.
- FALSE ensures an exact match for the VLOOKUP.

I'll copy this formula down through all rows in the 2014 sheet. This should populate the new column with the corresponding MA rates from 2013, allowing a direct comparison between the two years without switching tabs.

Potential issues I might face include:
1. Mismatched data types or formats in the unique ID columns causing VLOOKUP to not find matches.
2. Incorrect column indexing if the headers or data structure changes.
3. Errors if there are duplicate entries in the unique IDs, which would cause incorrect lookups.

To troubleshoot, I'd check that all unique IDs match exactly between sheets, ensure that the column numbers in the VLOOKUP formula are accurate, and verify that each step in preparing the spreadsheets was done correctly.

Overall, this process should neatly integrate the historical data into the current sheet for a clear year-over-year comparison.
