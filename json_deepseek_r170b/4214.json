Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given syllabus from Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism for Duff Wilson's Investigative Skills course in April 2014. The JSON should have specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, the id is straightforward; it's provided as 4214.

Next, I need to look at the authors section. In the syllabus, Duff Wilson is listed with his email and affiliation. His name is Duff Wilson, email is duffwilson@gmail.com, and the affiliation is Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. So that should be correctly formatted as an object within the authors array.

The conference key needs to be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Since this syllabus doesn't mention any conference, I'll set it to "Not Listed".

Year is given as April 2014, so that's clear.

Title should be the title of the document. In this case, it's "Investigative Skills" from the syllabus.

Description needs a brief summary. The syllabus covers the fundamentals of investigative reporting, including FOIA and other skills, so I'll write something like: "A course syllabus covering the basics of investigative journalism."

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking through the content, relevant keywords could be FOIA, Investigative Reporting, Journalism Education.

Putting it all together, each part is filled out based on the information provided.

Here's a JSON object created from the syllabus:

```json
{
  "id": 4214,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Duff Wilson",
      "email": "duffwilson@gmail.com",
      "affiliation": "Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": 2014,
  "title": "Investigative Skills",
  "description": "A course syllabus covering the basics of investigative journalism.",
  "keywords": ["FOIA", "Investigative Reporting", "Journalism Education"]
}
```
