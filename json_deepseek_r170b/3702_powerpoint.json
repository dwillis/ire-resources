Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's instructions. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id should be "3702_powerpoint". That’s straightforward.

Next, looking for authors. The main author listed is Daniel Connolly from The Commercial Appeal. His email and contact info are provided, so I can include that. There are other contributors mentioned: Amos Maki, Roland Klose, Grant Smith, and Michael Erskine. However, the user says not to make up any names and leave them as null if none are listed. Since these contributors don't have emails or affiliations beyond The Commercial Appeal, I'll include their names with affiliation as "The Commercial Appeal" but set email to null.

For the conference, it's an IRE event, so that’s clear.

The year isn’t mentioned in the text, so I’ll set it to "Not Listed".

The title is provided: "Finding the holes in economic impact studies".

Now, the description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet focuses on questioning economic impact studies by looking at who funded them, the multipliers used, and comparing subsidies to job creation.

Keywords should include up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Relevant terms are "economic impact", "subsidies", "job creation", "multipliers", and "transparency".

Putting it all together, I structure each key accordingly, ensuring correct data types and nesting for the authors array.
