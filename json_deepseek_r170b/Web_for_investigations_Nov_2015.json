Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down what's needed.

First, the structure should have specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. 

Looking at the content, the id is given as "Web_for_investigations_Nov_2015". The author listed is Doug Haddix. I don't see an email or affiliation for him, so those will be null.

The conference is clearly IRE since that's part of the tipsheet title. The year isn't explicitly mentioned, but from the context and the filename, it seems to be November 2015, so I'll use "2015".

For the title, it's "Web for Investigations". 

The description needs a concise summary. The tipsheet covers various web search techniques, tools like Google Search, social media searches on Twitter and Facebook, deep web resources such as Pipl and Biznar, mapping tools like BatchGeo, and productivity apps like IFTTT.

Keywords should include up to five relevant terms: "web search", "investigative journalism", "Google Search", "social media", "deep web".

I need to make sure everything is in English and enclosed in quotes. Also, no made-up namesâ€”Doug Haddix's email and affiliation stay null since they aren't provided.

Putting it all together should give me the correct JSON structure as specified.
