Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on this tipsheet from an IRE conference. Let me see what information I have here.

The tipsheet number is 2567. The author's name is Tommy Kaas. His email isn't provided, but his affiliation is Dicar, which stands for Danish International Center for Analytical Reporting.

The conference is IRE, so that's straightforward. The year isn't mentioned anywhere in the text, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

The title of the tipsheet is "Excel macro Web scraping." For the description, I need a concise summary. It's about using Excel macros to scrape data from web pages with statistical info on Danish parishes.

Keywords should be relevant and up to five. I can use "Web scraping," "Excel macros," "Data journalism," "Statistical data," and "Automated reporting."

I'll structure all this into the JSON format as specified.

```json
{
  "id": 2567,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Tommy Kaas",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Danish International Center for Analytical Reporting"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Excel macro Web scraping",
  "description": "A guide on using Excel macros to scrape statistical data from web pages, specifically focusing on Danish parish data.",
  "keywords": [
    "Web scraping",
    "Excel macros",
    "Data journalism",
    "Statistical data",
    "Automated reporting"
  ]
}
```
