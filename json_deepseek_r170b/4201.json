Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, looking at the user's query, they provided a tipsheet titled "Mining documents to build your investigation" presented by Jim Neff. My task is to extract specific information into predefined JSON keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

Starting with the 'id', it should be 4201 as specified. The 'authors' section needs a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. In the provided text, Jim Neff is listed along with his contact information. His name is given, so I'll set that. His email is jneff@seattletimes.com, and since he's affiliated with The Seattle Times, that will be his affiliation.

Next, the 'conference' is clearly stated as IRE, so I'll note that down. The year of the event is June 27, 2014, which is explicitly mentioned, so 'year' will be 2014.

For the 'title', it's straightforward: "Mining documents to build your investigation".

The 'description' needs to be a concise summary in simple language. The tipsheet emphasizes using archives and specific tools for investigative journalism. I'll craft a sentence that captures this essence without getting too detailed.

Lastly, 'keywords' should include relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, appropriate keywords are "document mining", "investigative journalism", "archival research", "government records", and "public access". These capture the main topics discussed.

I need to ensure all keys and values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, since the year is clearly provided, it's not marked as "Not Listed".

Putting it all together, I structure each part according to the guidelines, making sure not to include any extra information beyond what's specified.
