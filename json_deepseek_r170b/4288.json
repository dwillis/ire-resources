Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. Let me first parse through the information provided.

The tipsheet is from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The title is "From Words to Pictures: Text Analysis and Visualization" by Nicholas Diakopoulos. 

Looking at the authors, only Nicholas Diakopoulos is mentioned. His email is nad@umd.edu and he's affiliated with the University of Maryland's Computational Journalism Lab.

The description should be a concise summary. It focuses on text analysis methods like counts, comparisons, and visualization tools for journalists.

For keywords, I'll extract relevant terms: "Text Analysis", "Visualization Tools", "Journalism", "Data Visualization", "Computational Journalism".

Since the conference is IRE, that's straightforward. The year isn't listed, so it remains "Not Listed". 

I need to ensure all keys are correctly formatted and values enclosed in quotes. No markdown should be present.
