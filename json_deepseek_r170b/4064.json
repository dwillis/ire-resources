Alright, I need to help the user by creating a JSON object based on their query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet regarding scraping PDFs with Tabula. 

First, I'll parse through the provided text. It starts with "Scraping PDFs with Tabula" and mentions several presenters: Manuel Aristarán (@manuelaristaran), Jeremy B. Merrill (@jeremybmerrill from The New York Times), and Mike Tigas (@mtigas from ProPublica). The conference is IRE, but the year isn't specified.

Next, I need to extract the authors. Each author should have a name, email, and affiliation. Since emails aren't provided, they'll be null. Affiliations are based on mentions: Manuel doesn't have one listed, so it's null. Jeremy is affiliated with The New York Times, and Mike with ProPublica.

The title of the tipsheet is clearly "Scraping PDFs with Tabula." For the description, I need a concise summary. The text discusses why PDFs are problematic for data extraction and introduces Tabula as a solution tool. It also explains two algorithms—original and spreadsheet—and notes that scanned PDFs might require OCR.

The conference is listed as "IRE" since it's an IRE event. Year isn't mentioned, so it remains "Not Listed." Keywords should be up to five relevant terms: "Tabula," "PDF scraping," "data journalism tools," "scanned PDFs," and "OCR software."

I'll structure the JSON with id 4064, list of authors with their details, conference info, a brief description, and keywords. Ensuring all keys are in quotes and values are correctly formatted without making up any information.
