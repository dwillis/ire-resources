Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me start by identifying each required key.

First, the id is given as T1927. Next, for authors, there's only Dr. Mark Hunter listed, with his affiliation at INSEAD. Since no email or other authors are provided, I'll set email to null and leave name as "Mark Hunter".

The conference is the Global Journalism Conference in Copenhagen 2003, so the conference key will be "Not Listed" since it's not an IRE or NICAR event.

The year is clearly stated as 2003. The title of the tipsheet is about understanding and covering extreme right political movements.

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet advises journalists to approach these movements by examining their culture, structure, and public communications rather than just seeing them as hateful groups. It also provides strategies for reporting on them effectively.

Keywords should include terms like "extreme right", "political movements", "journalism", "investigative reporting", and "culture". I'll limit it to five relevant terms.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Double-checking each key to make sure everything is correctly formatted without any markdown.
