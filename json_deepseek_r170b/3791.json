Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has specified several keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, I'll assign the id as 3791 since that's provided. Next, the conference is clearly stated as IRE 2012, so conference will be "IRE" and year will be 2012.

Looking at the authors, there are four names: Ben Poston, Jennifer LaFleur, Sam Sommers, and Sandy Close. Their affiliations are Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, ProPublica, Tufts University, and New America Media respectively. Each author object should include name, email, and affiliation. However, emails aren't provided in the input, so they'll be null.

The title of the tipsheet is "Investigating Racial Disparities." For the description, I need a concise summary. The content discusses methodologies for investigating racial disparities using data analysis, mapping, and statistical methods across various topics like city services and traffic stops. So, the description could be: "A session on methodologies for investigating racial disparities using data analysis, mapping, and statistical approaches."

Keywords should be no more than five terms excluding conference and authors. Relevant keywords from the content are "racial disparities," "data analysis," "mapping," "statistical methods," and "investigative reporting."

Now, I'll structure all these elements into a JSON object with appropriate enclosures and formatting.
