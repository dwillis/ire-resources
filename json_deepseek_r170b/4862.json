Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on this tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id is given as 4862, that's straightforward. Now, for the authors section, there's only one author mentioned: Christopher Schnaars from USA TODAY. His email is provided, so I'll include that. The affiliation should be USA TODAY since that's his employer. 

Next, the conference is IRE because it's an IRE tipsheet. The year isn't explicitly stated in the text, so I have to go with "Not Listed". 

The title of the tipsheet is "Cracking the Political Piggy Bank", which makes sense as a headline for the content. For the description, I need a concise summary. Looking at the topics covered: analyzing FEC data, using Excel, avoiding common pitfalls, and specific resources like Sunlight Foundation data and Open Secrets. So I'll summarize that into one or two sentences.

Keywords should be no more than five terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, terms like "political finance", "FEC data", "campaign contributions", "data analysis", and "Excel" are relevant. 

I need to ensure all keys are in English and properly quoted. I'll structure it accordingly without making up any names or affiliations where they aren't provided.
