Alright, I need to figure out how to create the JSON object based on the user's query. Let me break down their instructions step by step.

First, they want an id of 3576. That seems straightforward. Next, authors should be a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. In the input text, I see "chris@webbmediagroup.com" mentioned several times. The name isn't explicitly provided, so according to the instructions, I'll set it as null.

Looking for the conference, the keywords include NICAR, so I should set conference to "NICAR". If there was no mention of a conference or if it wasn't clear, I would have used "Not Listed".

For the year, the input doesn't specify when the event took place. So, following instructions, year will be "Not Listed".

The title needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary. The main topic seems to be online search strategies and tools for journalists, so I'll craft that into a concise title.

Description should also be brief, summarizing the content in simple terms. It looks like the presentation covers various tools and methods for effective online research.

Keywords are next. They want up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the text, keywords like "online search", "journalism tools", "investigative reporting" seem relevant.

Putting it all together, I structure each key accordingly, ensuring that all values are in English and properly quoted as per JSON standards.

  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Online Search Strategies and Tools for Investigative Journalism",
  "description": "A presentation covering online search techniques, tools, and strategies relevant to investigative journalism.",
