Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided input. Let me start by carefully reading through the input to extract the necessary information.

First, the id should be 3680. That's straightforward.

Looking for authors: The text doesn't mention any specific names. It talks about news organizations like "The New York Times" and others, but without individual author names. So, I'll set the authors list with a single element where name is null. Since there are no emails or affiliations provided for individuals, those will be null as well.

Next, the conference: The input mentions "IRE", so that's the conference name.

For the year: The text doesn't specify the event's year, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

The title isn't explicitly given. The closest is a mention of a session about data journalism tools and resources, so I'll craft a title around that.

Description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. The text discusses data journalism tools like Tabula, OpenRefine, and others used at news organizations, so the description will reflect that.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. I'll include data journalism, tools, resources, software, and applications.

Putting it all together, I structure each key with appropriate values, ensuring everything is in English and properly quoted.

```json

  "id": 3680,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Session on Data Journalism Tools and Resources",
  "description": "A discussion about various tools used in data journalism, such as Tabula and OpenRefine, to extract and analyze data from public records and documents.",
  "keywords": [
    "data journalism",
    "tools",
    "resources",
    "software",
    "applications"
  ]
}
```
