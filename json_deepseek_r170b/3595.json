Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, let's break down the input. The tipsheet is titled "Census on a tight timeline" by Adam Playford of the Palm Beach Post. It discusses how they handled a tight deadline for reporting census data using tools like Google Fusion Tables and jQuery libraries.

Now, looking at the required keys:

- id: Should be 3595.
- authors: A list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. Here, only Adam Playford is mentioned, so others are null. Affiliation is Palm Beach Post since that's his employer.
- conference: It's an IRE conference as per the user's example.
- year: The input doesn't specify the year, so it should be "Not Listed".
- title: Directly from the tipsheet, "Census on a tight timeline".
- description: Needs to be 1-2 sentences. It should summarize their approach and tools used under time constraints.
- keywords: Up to five terms excluding conference and authors. So terms like Google Fusion Tables, jQuery, GIS, data mapping, deadline reporting.

I need to ensure all keys are in quotes and values as per instructions. The description must be concise, capturing the essence without being too detailed.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part step by step, making sure not to miss any details or add extra information beyond what's provided.
