Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me break down what they've asked for.

First, the structure should include specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 5228. 

Looking at the authors section, there are four speakers listed with their names, emails, and affiliations. I'll need to extract each of these details. For example, Nate Morabito's email is provided, and his affiliation is WJHL-TV. Similarly, Susan Richardson is affiliated with The Chicago Reporter, Rose Ciotta with EdSource, and Thomas Peele with the Mercury News and East Bay Times.

The conference is IRE, so that's straightforward. The year isn't mentioned in the text, so it should be "Not Listed". 

For the title, the tipsheet is titled "Smart strategies for small newsrooms". The description needs to be a concise summary. I'll note that it provides practical advice on collaboration, resource management, and efficient reporting.

Keywords should be relevant and limited to five terms. From the content, the main points are about small newsrooms, resources, collaborations, investigative journalism, and efficiency. These make good keywords.

I also need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Each author entry should have name, email, and affiliation, with any missing fields set to null. However, since each speaker's information is provided, I can fill those in without issues.

Finally, I'll structure the JSON object accordingly, making sure it's valid and follows the specified format.
