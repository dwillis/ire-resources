Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I'll identify the required keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 4331.

Looking at the input, the author's name is Ellen Gabler. Her email is egabler@jrn.com and her affiliation is Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. So under authors, I'll have a list with one object containing these details.

The conference listed is NICAR 2015 - Atlanta, so the conference key should be "NICAR". The year is clearly 2015.

For the title, it's "Tell me a story I won’t forget".

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet emphasizes telling a hard-hitting data story that’s not boring by using narrative techniques and including both good and bad examples. So I'll write something like: "Tips for making data-driven investigative stories engaging by using storytelling techniques, finding strong examples, and being transparent about data limitations."

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Relevant keywords here are "investigative journalism", "data storytelling", "narrative techniques", "transparency in reporting", and "storytelling".

Putting it all together, I'll structure each key with appropriate values, ensuring that everything is in English and enclosed in quotes as per JSON standards.
