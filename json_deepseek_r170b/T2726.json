Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down the steps.

First, identify the required fields: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as T2726.

Next, look at the authors. There are two: Peter Overby from NPR and Jonathan D. Salant from Bloomberg News. Each should have name, email, and affiliation. Their emails are provided, so I'll include those. Affiliations are their news organizations since they're listed next to their names.

The conference is either IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed. Since this is an IRE tipsheet, it's IRE.

Year isn't explicitly mentioned here, so it remains "Not Listed".

Title is straightforward: "50 Campaign Finance Stories in 50 Minutes".

Description needs a concise summary. The tipsheet provides various story ideas related to campaign finance, including fundraising, expenses, PACs, and personal financial disclosures. So the description could be about practical ways to investigate campaign finances.

Keywords should include up to five relevant terms. Looking at the content, "campaign finance", "fundraising", "PACs", "financial disclosure", and "lobbyists" are key topics.

Now, structure all this into a JSON object with proper syntax.
