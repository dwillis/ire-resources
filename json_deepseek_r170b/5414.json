Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to create this JSON object based on the given instructions. The user provided a chunk of text that seems like notes from some conference or presentation about using data in criminal justice reporting. My task is to extract specific information and structure it into a JSON with certain keys.

First, let's break down the requirements:

1. **id**: Should be 5414.
2. **authors**: A list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. I shouldn't make up names; if none are listed, leave name as null. Email and affiliation can be null too. If a news org is mentioned, use that as affiliation.
3. **conference**: Must be "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". I need to check the text for clues about which conference this is from.
4. **year**: Same as conference; if not clear, mark as "Not Listed".
5. **title**: The title of the presentation or talk.
6. **description**: A 1-2 sentence summary in simple language.
7. **keywords**: Up to five terms, excluding conference and authors.

Looking at the provided text:

- There's a mention of a Middle Ages history professor advising about data reliability. That might not help with the author.
- The text discusses using OBTS (Offender-Based Tracking System) and DOC data for investigative journalism, particularly in Florida.
- It lists states using OBTS systems but doesn't name any authors or specific conferences explicitly.

I notice that towards the end, there's a section on "Getting your hands on it" which includes a request template. The user wrote that they had to ask for data for research purposes, mentioning converting identifiers to unique codes. But no author names are provided here.

Given this, I can infer:

- **id**: 5414 is straightforward.
- **authors**: Since no specific authors are named in the text, each entry will have name as null, email and affiliation also null.
- **conference**: The text doesn't mention IRE or NICAR specifically. IRE stands for Investigative Reporters and Editors, which seems relevant because this is about investigative journalism. However, without explicit mention, it's safer to go with "Not Listed".
- **year**: No specific year is given in the text, so "Not Listed".
- **title**: The main topic is using OBTS and DOC data for criminal justice reporting.
- **description**: Summarize that the presentation discusses using OBTS and DOC data to investigate criminal justice, highlighting challenges and benefits, leading to policy changes.
- **keywords**: From the content, keywords could be "criminal justice", "data journalism", "OBTS", "sentencing equity", "investigative reporting".

I also need to make sure that all keys and values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. The authors list should have elements even if they're null.

Double-checking for any possible author names: The text doesn't provide any, so authors remain with nulls.
