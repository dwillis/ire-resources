Alright, let's break down this user query step by step. They want me to create a JSON object based on specific guidelines from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The input provided includes details about a session titled "Investigating for radio + podcasting" led by Neena Satija.

First, I need to extract the necessary information. The ID is given as 4946. Next, there's one author, Neena Satija, with her email and affiliation from RevealNews.org. So, the authors array will have one object with her name, email, and affiliation.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE", so that goes into the conference field. The year isn't mentioned in the input, so I'll default it to "Not Listed". 

For the title, it's straightforward: "Investigating for radio + podcasting". The description needs to be a concise summary of the session's focus. It should mention using audio for storytelling and its benefits for journalists.

Now, keywords. They should be relevant and no more than five. From the content, appropriate keywords are "audio journalism", "radio reporting", "podcasting", "investigative reporting", and "storytelling techniques".

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, there's a note to avoid making up any names and handle cases where info might be missing by setting them to null if necessary.

Putting it all together, the JSON structure should have each key with the correct data as per the instructions. I'll double-check to make sure everything aligns with what the user asked for.
