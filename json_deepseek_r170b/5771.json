Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, the id is given as 5771, so that's straightforward. 

Next, for authors, the tipsheet mentions Emilia DÃ­az-Struck from @icijorg. Since there are no other authors listed, the list will have only one entry. Her email and affiliation aren't provided, but since she's associated with ICIJ, I'll use that as her affiliation.

The conference is NICAR 2019, so the year is 2019. The title of the tipsheet is "Machine Learning and Investigative Reporting."

For the description, it needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet discusses using machine learning in investigative journalism, particularly for analyzing large datasets like financial records and medical device reports. It also highlights challenges like data quality and collaboration between reporters and programmers.

Keywords should include machine learning, investigative reporting, ICIJ, NICAR 2019, and data analysis. These are the main topics covered without including the conference or authors as per instructions.

I need to ensure all keys are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Each value is also in English since the original text was in English. 

Now, putting it all together into a JSON structure with the specified keys and values.
