Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given input, following specific instructions. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the user provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The main speakers are James Drew and Mike Wilkinson, both from The Blade. Their contact emails are listed, so I can include those. The title of the session is "Mercaderes de información e influencia: Rastreando lobistas, consultores y personas que recaudan fondos," which translates to something about tracking lobbyists and fundraisers.

I need to structure this into a JSON object with keys id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 2884, so that's straightforward. 

For the authors, each should have name, email, and affiliation. James Drew's affiliation isn't explicitly stated next to his name but since both work for The Blade, I can use that as their affiliation. Their emails are provided, so those go in too.

The conference is clearly IRE, so that's set. The year isn't mentioned anywhere in the text, so it should be "Not Listed".

The title needs to be in English as per instructions, even though the original is in Spanish. So I'll translate it to something like "Information Merchants and Influence: Tracking Lobbyists, Consultants, and Fundraisers."

For the description, a 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. It should explain that the session covers using public records to track lobbyists, fundraisers, etc., and mentions specific resources.

Keywords are up to five terms. I'll pick relevant ones like "lobbyists," "campaign finance," "public records," "fundraisers," and "investigative reporting."

I need to make sure all values are in English unless the original is different, which it isn't here except for the title. All keys must be enclosed in quotes.

Putting it all together, I structure each part carefully, ensuring no made-up data, especially for authors' names, which should be null if not provided—but they are listed here.
