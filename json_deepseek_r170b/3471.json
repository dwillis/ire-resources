Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE). Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the id is straightforward: it's 3471 as specified. Next, looking for authors. The only name mentioned is Jacob Harris, but there's no email or affiliation provided in the text. So his details will be name: "Jacob Harris", email: null, and affiliation: null since nothing else is given.

The conference is IRE because that's where the tipsheet is from. The year is clearly stated as 2011, so that's easy. The title of the tipsheet is "MGRS Explained".

For the description, I need a concise summary in simple language. The tipsheet explains how to decode Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) coordinates used in military reports, providing examples and accuracy details.

Keywords should be relevant and up to five. MGRS is key since it's the main topic. CAR 2011 refers to the conference, but waitâ€”no, the keywords should exclude the conference name itself. So maybe "CAR" isn't a keyword here. Instead, I'll focus on terms like MGRS, decoding, military reports, geocoordinates, and precision.

Putting it all together, ensuring each field is correctly formatted and values are enclosed in quotes. Double-checking that no made-up information is included and everything aligns with the user's instructions.
