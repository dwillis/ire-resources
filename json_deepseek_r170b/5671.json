Okay, so I'm trying to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down what's needed.

First, I need to extract information like the ID, authors, conference name, year, title, description, and keywords. The ID is given as 5671, so that's straightforward.

Looking at the authors section, the tipsheet mentions Denise Malan with her email denise@ire.org and affiliation with IRE. There's also a mention of Kate Howard who provided some resources, but no contact info for her. So I'll include both authors with the available details.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE" since it's from Investigative Reporters and Editors. The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the text, so I'll set that to "Not Listed".

For the title, I'll use a relevant one like "Web Searching and Research Tips for Journalists". The description should be a concise summary of what the tipsheet coversâ€”something about strategies and tools for effective online research.

Keywords are important. From the content, terms like "web searching", "research strategies", "investigative journalism", "backgrounding sources", and "online tools" seem appropriate and within the limit of five.

Putting it all together, I structure each part carefully to ensure accuracy and completeness based on the provided information.
