Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The input provided includes details about a research guide by Larry Lopez from Strategic Research, presented at an IRE event in 2007.

First, I'll start by identifying each required key for the JSON object: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

1. **id**: The user specified that it should be 2923.
2. **authors**: This is a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. From the input, Larry Lopez is the author with his email and affiliation provided. There's also mention of Bruce Maston, but without an email or affiliation, so I'll include him with nulls where necessary.
3. **conference**: The text mentions it's part of an IRE conference, so this key will be "IRE".
4. **year**: Clearly listed as 2007 in the input.
5. **title**: The title given is "Research Guide on Medical and Expert Testimony".
6. **description**: Needs to be a concise summary. I'll mention that it's a guide for journalists and researchers covering expert testimony and medical malpractice.
7. **keywords**: Extract relevant terms like expert testimony, Daubert standards, medical records, etc., but limit them to five.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, make sure not to invent any information and handle nulls where data isn't available.

Now, structuring this into the JSON format as per the user's specifications.
