Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The user provided specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, I'll start with the "id" which is straightforward: "_IRE_presentation". 

Next, for "authors", the user mentioned that if no names are listed, I should leave it null. In the input, there's a contact section mentioning Marisa Kwiatkowski, including her email and social media handles. So, her name is available, and she's affiliated with IndyStar as indicated by her email domain. Therefore, I'll include her details in the authors array.

The "conference" key should be set to "IRE" since it's an IRE conference tipsheet.

For the "year", the input doesn't specify a particular year, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

The "title" is given at the top of the document: "Tackling sexual harassment and misconduct".

Now, the "description" needs to be a concise 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet covers investigative practices for handling sensitive cases, including locating survivors, interviewing techniques, maintaining confidentiality, organizing information, and fact-checking. So, I'll craft a brief description that encapsulates these points.

Regarding "keywords", I should pick up to five relevant terms from the content. Key themes include sexual harassment, misconduct investigations, survivor interviews, confidentiality, and journalism practices. These will serve as appropriate keywords.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, no keys or values should be made up beyond what's provided.

Putting it all together, I structure the JSON with each key filled according to these considerations.
