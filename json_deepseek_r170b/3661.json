Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through the document step by step.

First, the id is given as 3661. That's straightforward.

Looking for authors: The tipsheet mentions Peter Aldhous, who is the San Francisco Bureau Chief at BuzzFeed News. His email is provided as peter@peteraldhous.com. So I'll list him with his name, email, and affiliation.

The conference is NICAR 2012 in St Louis. So the conference key should be "NICAR" and the year is 2012.

The title of the session isn't explicitly mentioned, but since it's about using NodeXL for network analysis, I'll go with "Using NodeXL for Network Analysis".

For the description, I need a concise summary. It's about applying NodeXL to analyze social media networks, focusing on metrics and visualizations. So I'll phrase that into one or two sentences.

Keywords should include NodeXL, network analysis, social media, visualization, and metricsâ€”keeping it to five terms as specified.

Putting it all together, the JSON structure will have id, authors (as an array with Peter's details), conference, year, title, description, and keywords. Ensuring all values are in English and properly quoted.
