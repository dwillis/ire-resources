Alright, I need to help the user by creating a JSON object from their provided tipsheet. Let me read through the details they've given.

First, the ID should be 4209 as specified. Next, I'll look at the authors section. There are three speakers: Greg Borowski, Lawan Hamilton, and George Papajohn. Each has an email and affiliation listed, so I can include those directly. 

The conference is clearly stated as the 2014 IRE Conference, so the conference key will be "IRE" and the year is 2014. The title of the session is provided, which I'll use exactly.

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about building successful watchdog teams through collaboration and inclusivity, highlighting both the benefits and challenges. I'll condense that into one or two sentences.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking at the content, "Watchdog reporting," "Teamwork," "Inclusive journalism," "Investigative journalism," and "Newsroom collaboration" seem appropriate.

I need to ensure all keys are in quotes and the structure is correct. No markdown, just a plain JSON object. Let me assemble each part step by step to make sure I don't miss anything.
