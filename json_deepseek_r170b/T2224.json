Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. The input provided includes details about an investigative report from Maurice Tamman of the Atlanta Journal Constitution regarding the use of Census data.

First, I'll extract the necessary information. The id is given as T2224. For authors, there's only one author mentioned: Maurice Tamman. His email and affiliation are provided, so I can fill those in. 

Next, the conference isn't explicitly stated, but looking at the content, it seems related to investigative journalism, which often falls under IRE or NICAR. Since it's about data and Census, I'll go with "NICAR" as the conference type.

The year isn't provided, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed". 

For the title, the main topic is using Census data for investigative stories, especially transitioning from the long form to the American Community Survey. So the title should reflect that change and its impact on journalism.

In the description, I need a concise summary. The key points are the shift to annual surveys replacing the long form, providing more current data but with limitations like higher margins of error in smaller areas.

Keywords should be relevant terms excluding conference names. "Census data", "American Community Survey", "Investigative journalism", "Data analysis", and "Demographic trends" seem appropriate.

I'll structure all these elements into the JSON format as specified, ensuring each key is correctly filled with the extracted information.
