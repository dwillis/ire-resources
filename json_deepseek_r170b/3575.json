Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. Let me read through their instructions carefully.

First, they provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference in Orlando, Florida, from 2011. The main speaker is David Donald from The Center for Public Integrity, and there's a mention of Maurice Tamman as his partner. 

The JSON object needs to have specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id should be 3575. For the authors section, each author should have name, email, and affiliation. I shouldn't make up names; if none are listed, leave it as null.

Looking at the text, David Donald is clearly mentioned with his contact info: ddonald@publicintegrity.org. Maurice Tamman's name appears, but without an email or affiliation, so I'll list him with nulls for those fields.

The conference is IRE, and the year is 2011 since it's specified in the header. The title isn't explicitly stated, but the main topic seems to be about accessing CMS data, so I'll go with "Accessing CMS Data for Investigative Reporting."

For the description, it should be a brief summary. The tipsheet talks about legal battles and data handling, so I can say something like: "A tipsheet detailing efforts to obtain and analyze Medicare claims data, including legal challenges and data management strategies." Keeping it under two sentences.

Keywords need to be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Relevant terms here are CMS Data, FOIA, Medicare Claims, Data Analysis, and Legal Challenges.

Putting it all together, I structure each part accordingly. Making sure all keys and values are in quotes as per JSON standards.
