Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's input with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The user has provided an example response, so I'll refer to that for guidance.

First, the id is given as 5717, which I'll include directly.

Next, the authors array. In the user's example, there are two author objects with name, email, and affiliation. However, looking at the input text, I don't see any names listed. So according to the instructions, I should leave the name null if none is provided. Email and affiliation can also be null. Since there's no news organization mentioned next to an author name, both authors in the example have null for all fields except email and affiliation are null.

Moving on to conference. The user specified that it should be "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". In this case, since the input doesn't mention a specific conference, I'll default to "Not Listed".

For the year, the instructions say to use the event's year if clearly identified; otherwise, set it as "Not Listed". The input text doesn't provide a year, so I'll go with "Not Listed".

The title needs to be taken from the text. In the example, it was about reporting on sexual violence, so I'll create a concise title like "Reporting and Investigating Sexual Violence Cases".

Description must be a 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. The input text talks about methods for journalists investigating sexual assault cases, overcoming record barriers, using legal exemptions, and understanding due process. So the description should capture that essence concisely.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the example, relevant keywords might be "sexual violence", "investigative journalism", "Title IX", "FERPA", "due process". I'll make sure they're in English and no more than five.

Putting it all together, I structure each key appropriately, ensuring correct syntax with quotes around keys and string values. Numeric id is without quotes, but since the example had it as a number, Iâ€™ll follow that.

I need to ensure there are no markdown elements and that everything is properly enclosed in quotes where necessary. Also, verify that all fields adhere to the user's instructions, especially handling nulls correctly for authors.
