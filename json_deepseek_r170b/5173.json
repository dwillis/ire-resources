Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user gave specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, the id is given as 5173, so that's straightforward. Next, for authors, I see Eric Wieffering listed with his title and contact info. Since there are no other authors mentioned, I'll create a list with just him. His name is provided, email is null because it's not in the text, and affiliation should be the news organization he's from, which looks like the Star Tribune.

The conference is definitely "IRE" as per the user's example. The year isn't specified here, so I'll set it to "Not Listed". The title of the tipsheet is clear: "Going Deep on Breaking News".

For the description, I need a 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. It should capture how newsrooms can balance daily coverage with deeper investigations during breaking news.

Keywords should be up to five terms related to the content. From the text, "Breaking News", "Enterprise Journalism", "Investigative Reporting", "Newsroom Management" seem appropriate.

I think that covers all the required keys. Now I'll structure it into JSON format as per the instructions.

```json

  "id": 5173,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Eric Wieffering",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Star Tribune"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Going Deep on Breaking News",
  "description": "This tipsheet discusses strategies for balancing daily breaking news coverage with deeper investigative reporting, focusing on the first days and weeks after a major event.",
  "keywords": [
    "Breaking News",
    "Enterprise Journalism",
    "Investigative Reporting",
    "Newsroom Management"
  ]
}
```
