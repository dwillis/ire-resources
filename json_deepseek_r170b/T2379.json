Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Debbie Wolfe. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the ID is given as T2379. That's straightforward. 

Next, authors. The document mentions Debbie Wolfe, and her email and affiliation are provided. So I'll list her with her name, email, and affiliation as "St. Petersburg (Fla.) Times".

The conference isn't explicitly mentioned here. It just says it's from Investigative Reporters and Editors conferences. Since IRE is one of the options, I'll go with that.

The year in the document is revised Nov. 21, 2003, so the year should be 2003.

The title is "Recipe for Success for Newsroom Technology Training".

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet provides guidance on structuring technology training for journalists, covering content outline, skill progression, and engagement methods. So I'll write that it offers a structured approach to planning effective tech training sessions.

Keywords should be relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking through the content, "technology training", "newsroom", "journalists", "skill development", and "engagement strategies" seem appropriate.

Now, putting it all together in JSON format with proper syntax.

  ],
  "conference": "IRE",

  "description": "This tipsheet offers guidance on structuring technology training sessions for journalists, including content outlines and engagement strategies.",
