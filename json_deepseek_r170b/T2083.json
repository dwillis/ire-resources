Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each requirement step by step.

First, I'll identify the id as "T2083" since that's specified.

Looking at the authors section, there's Chris Halsne listed with his email and affiliation as KIRO-TV in Seattle. So, the authors array will have one object with name: "Chris Halsne", email: "chalsne@kirotv.com", and affiliation: "KIRO-TV".

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's straightforward.

The year is given as Atlanta 2004, so I'll set year to 2004.

For the title, it's "Hidden Cameras and Wireless Transmitters".

Next, the description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet discusses the benefits, shortfalls, and legal considerations of using hidden cameras with wireless transmitters. So, I'll craft a sentence that captures this essence without getting too detailed.

Keywords are next. From the content, relevant terms are "hidden cameras", "wireless transmitters", "investigative reporting", "legal considerations", and "surveillance equipment". I'll make sure not to exceed five keywords.

I need to ensure all keys are in quotes and values are appropriately formatted. No markdown should be present, just a clean JSON structure.

Finally, I'll review the JSON to make sure it meets all specified requirements: correct id, authors with proper attributes, accurate conference info, concise description, relevant keywords, etc.
