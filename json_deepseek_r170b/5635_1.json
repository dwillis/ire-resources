Alright, so I'm trying to create a JSON object based on the provided instructions. Let me start by understanding what's needed.

First, the id should be "5635_1". That seems straightforward.

Next, authors is a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. The input text doesn't mention any specific authors, so I'll leave the name as null. Email and affiliation can also be null since there's no information provided about them.

The conference key should be one of "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Looking at the text, it talks about the Census Bureauâ€™s County Flows Mapper and migration data, which are common topics at NICAR (National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting) conferences. So I'll set this to "NICAR".

For the year, since there's no specific event year mentioned in the input, I'll set it to "Not Listed".

The title isn't explicitly provided, but from the context, a suitable title could be something like "Analyzing Migration Data with County Flows Mapper". 

The description needs to be a concise summary. The text discusses using tools like County Flows Mapper for analyzing migration data between counties, so I'll summarize that.

Keywords should be up to five terms related to the content but excluding the conference and authors. Relevant keywords here would be "migration data", "County Flows Mapper", "geographical mobility", "census data", and "data analysis".

Putting it all together, each part of the JSON object is filled out based on the input and the instructions provided.

    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Analyzing Migration Data with County Flows Mapper",
  "description": "The text describes how to analyze migration data using tools like the County Flows Mapper and geographical mobility tables from the Census Bureau.",
  "keywords": [
    "migration data",
    "County Flows Mapper",
    "geographical mobility",
    "census data",
