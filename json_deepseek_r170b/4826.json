Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has provided specific instructions, so I should follow them carefully.

First, the ID is fixed at 4826. That's straightforward.

Next, looking for authors. The text mentions "Nils Mulvad" as the speaker, but no other names are listed. So, the authors list will have one element with name set to "Nils Mulvad", email and affiliation as null because there's no info provided about them in the tipsheet.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE since it's from an IRE event in 2016, so that key is "IRE".

The year is given as June 2016, New Orleans, so year should be 2016.

For the title, I need to summarize the content. The main focus is on extracting PDFs to Excel, so a suitable title would be "PDF Extraction to Excel".

The description needs to be a concise summary. It mentions tools like Cometdocs, Ilovepdf, and Investintech for converting PDFs to Excel. So, the description can state that it compares these tools for handling different PDFs.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Relevant keywords here are "PDF extraction", "Excel conversion", "Cometdocs", "Ilovepdf", and "Investintech".

Putting it all together, I structure each part accordingly, ensuring all keys and values are in quotes and the JSON is correctly formatted.
