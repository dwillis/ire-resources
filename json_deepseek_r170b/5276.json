Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given input about Karl Idsvoog's tipsheet from an IRE conference. Let me start by identifying each required key.

First, the id is straightforward: it should be 5276 as specified. Next, authors. The text mentions Karl Idsvoog and his email and affiliation. So in the authors list, I'll have one object with name "Karl Idsvoog", email "kidsvoog@kent.edu", and affiliation "Kent State University" since that's his employer.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE 2017, so the conference key will be "IRE". The year is 2017, so that goes into the year field. 

For the title, it's given as "Production Tips for Skype/Facetime Interviews – IRE 2017", which I can use directly.

The description needs to be a concise summary. Looking at the content, it's about tips for conducting better video interviews using Skype or FaceTime, covering technical aspects like lighting and audio. So a good summary would mention that.

Keywords should include terms related to the content but exclude the conference and author names. Relevant keywords are "Skype", "Facetime", "interviews", "multimedia journalism", "video production".

Putting it all together, I structure each key with appropriate values ensuring correct data types and formatting. Making sure strings are in quotes and arrays are properly comma-separated.
