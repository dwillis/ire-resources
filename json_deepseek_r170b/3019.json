Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions about the structure of the JSON with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, the id is straightforward—it's given as 3019. Next, I look at the authors section. In the text, Ronald Campbell from The Orange County Register is listed with his contact info. Since there are no other authors mentioned, the list will have only one entry. His name is Ronald Campbell, email is rcampbell@ocregister.com, and affiliation is The Orange County Register.

The conference key needs to be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Looking at the content, it's from an IRE conference tipsheet, so that's clear—it should be "IRE".

For the year, the user mentioned if it's not clearly stated, use "Not Listed". The provided text doesn't specify a year, so I'll set year to "Not Listed".

The title is already given as "Money & Politics", which seems appropriate. 

Now, the description needs to be a concise 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. The tipsheet discusses various websites for tracking campaign finance and lobbying at both federal and state levels. So, I'll phrase it to reflect that.

Keywords are next—up to five terms excluding conference or authors. Looking through the content, relevant keywords would include "campaign finance", "lobbying", "websites", "politics", and "transparency". These capture the main topics covered.

I should also make sure all values are in English and keys are properly enclosed in quotes. No markdown is needed, just a plain JSON structure.
