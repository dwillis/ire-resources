Okay, I need to create a JSON object from the user's input based on their specific instructions. Let me go through this step by step.

First, the ID should be T591. That part is straightforward. Next, looking at the authors section. The input doesn't list any authors' names, so each author entry in the array will have name as null. Since there are no emails or affiliations mentioned either, those fields will also be null for all entries.

Moving on to the conference key. The user provided options: "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". I don't see any mention of a conference in the input text, so it should default to "Not Listed".

For the year, again, there's no specific event year mentioned, so it will be "Not Listed" as well.

The title needs to be based on the main subject. The input is about investigative resources related to conflict and arms trade, so a suitable title would be something like "Investigative Resources on Conflict and Arms Trade".

Now, the description should be a concise summary in simple language. Looking at the content, it's about various organizations, books, and their roles in studying conflicts, arms trade, etc. So I'll summarize that into one or two sentences.

Lastly, the keywords. I need up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the text, relevant keywords would be "Investigative Journalism", "Conflict Research", "Arms Trade", "Small Arms", and "Peace Studies".

Putting it all together, ensuring each part aligns with the instructions and formatting correctly as JSON.

  "title": "Investigative Resources on Conflict and Arms Trade",
  "description": "A collection of investigative resources, organizations, and literature focusing on global conflicts, arms trade, small arms proliferation, and peace research.",
