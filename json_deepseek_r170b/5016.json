Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on how each key should be filled out. Let me break down the steps.

First, the id is straightforwardâ€”5016 as specified.

Next, authors. Looking at the document, I see Steve Myers mentioned with his affiliation as The Lens and his Twitter handle @myersnews. Since there are no other authors listed, the authors array will have one object. His name is Steve Myers, email is null because it's not provided, and affiliation is "The Lens".

Conference is either IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed. The bit.ly link includes 'nicar17', which indicates this was from the 2017 NICAR conference. So, conference should be "NICAR" and year is 2017.

Title is clearly "Social media sleuthing".

Description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers various techniques for verifying sources on social media during breaking news, general backgrounding, and investigative research. It includes tools like Twitter Collections and Facebook Graph searches. So I'll summarize that in one or two sentences.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords are "social media", "investigative reporting", "source verification", "online research tools", and "backgrounding".

Putting it all together, ensuring each key is properly enclosed in quotes and values are correctly formatted. No markdown, just a plain JSON object.
