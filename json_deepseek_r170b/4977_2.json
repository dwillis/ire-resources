Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided input from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, let's break down the input. It starts with "Jenny Ye, Data Director @thepapaya" which suggests she is one of the authors. Then there's information about a Twitter bot called @nailbiterbot that alerts users about close March Madness games. The criteria for what makes a game a nailbiter are detailed, along with steps to create the bot using live score data and scripts.

Looking further down, there are mentions of other projects like finding ice cream spots via text, a sledding map, temperature in Harlem, and sonifying data. There's also a job listing for a Data and Interactive Journalism Editor at WNYC, which indicates WNYC is the affiliation. Story links are provided, pointing to Twitter and various WNYC projects.

Now, mapping this to the JSON keys:

- **id**: The user specified it should be "4977_2".
- **authors**: There's Jenny Ye listed, but her email isn't provided. Affiliation is likely WNYC since they're hiring and linked in the stories.
- **conference**: Since it's from an IRE conference tipsheet, this should be "IRE".
- **year**: The input doesn't mention a specific year, so it'll be "Not Listed".
- **title**: Should capture the main topic, which is creating the @nailbiterbot for March Madness.
- **description**: A concise summary of the project and its purpose.
- **keywords**: Relevant terms excluding conference and authors. From the content, "March Madness", "Twitter bot", "live scores", "data journalism", "close games" fit well.

I need to ensure all these elements are correctly formatted in JSON with proper quotation marks and structure. Also, since Jenny's email isn't provided, it remains null.
