Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from the 2010 CAR Conference in Phoenix, Arizona. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON.

First, I'll note that the id should be 3337 as specified. Next, looking at the authors section, Rob Oâ€™Dell is mentioned along with his affiliation, the Arizona Daily Star. Since there's no email provided, it will remain null.

The conference is clearly stated as the 2010 CAR Conference in Phoenix, Arizona. The year is 2010, so that's straightforward. The title of the tipsheet is "Watchdogging Government Spending."

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet provides strategies for journalists to uncover government spending data, so the description should reflect that it offers practical advice and techniques.

Keywords are limited to five terms. From the content, relevant keywords would be "government spending," "investigative journalism," "data analysis," "FOIA," and "transparency."

I also need to ensure all keys and values are in English and enclosed in quotes. The conference type isn't explicitly IRE or NICAR; it's a CAR conference, so the conference field will be "Not Listed."
