Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided input. The user gave me specific instructions about what each key should contain. Let's break this down step by step.

First, looking at the structure: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as T1595. 

Next, for authors, it says to make a list of elements with name, email, and affiliation. I shouldn't make up any names; if none are listed, leave name null. Email and affiliation can be null too. If the text mentions a news organization, use that as affiliation.

In the input, I see references like Kurt Eichenwald from The New York Times. So, his entry would have name: "Kurt Eichenwald", email: null, affiliation: "The New York Times".

Then there are other authors mentioned without names, so their entries will have name: null, email: null, and if they're from an organization like SEC or FTC, that can be the affiliation. Wait, actually, the user said to use the news organization as affiliation only if the author's name is listed. Since these others don't have names, maybe it's better not to assign affiliations unless explicitly tied to a name.

Wait, no—the instruction says if the text includes the name of a news organization, use that as affiliation for authors without an explicit one. Hmm, I think it's safer to only include affiliation when the author's name is present alongside the organization.

So Kurt Eichenwald has The New York Times as his affiliation because he's named and affiliated with them. Others are just mentioned by their titles or roles, so maybe they don't get an affiliation unless specified.

Now, moving on to conference: it should be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". I'm not sure which conference this is from. The input doesn't mention the conference name, so I'll set it to "Not Listed".

Year: similarly, there's no specific year given in the text, so I'll put "Not Listed" as well.

Title: the user provided a title already, "Investigative Reporting Resources", which seems appropriate.

Description: needs to be 1-2 sentences summarizing the input. The text lists various resources for investigating companies and individuals, including regulatory websites, SEC actions, etc. So I can write something like "A collection of investigative reporting resources including regulatory websites, enforcement actions, and tools for tracking company and executive behavior."

Keywords: up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking through the content, relevant keywords might be "investigative journalism", "regulatory actions", "SEC", "enforcement records", "insider trading".

Putting it all together:

id is T1595.

authors list includes:
- Kurt Eichenwald with affiliation.
- Others without names but perhaps from organizations? Wait, no—the user said if the text includes a news organization name and an author's name, then use it. Since other authors are not named, their entries would have null for name, email, and maybe affiliation.

Wait, in the input, after Kurt Eichenwald, there are mentions of other reporters or sources? Not really; the rest seems to be about resources rather than authors. So perhaps only Kurt Eichenwald is listed as an author with his details, and others aren't named, so they don't get their own entries.

But wait, the user's example includes multiple authors, including some with nulls. Maybe I should include all possible authors mentioned. Let me check:

In the input, it's mostly about resources and mentions Kurt Eichenwald as an author from The New York Times. There are no other named authors, so perhaps only he is included.

Wait, but in the user's example, they have multiple authors with some nulls. Maybe I need to include all possible entries where there might be an author mentioned or not. But since only Kurt Eichenwald is a named author, others would just have name: null.

Alternatively, maybe the text doesn't mention other authors beyond the ones from organizations like SEC or FTC, but those are institutions, not individual authors. So perhaps only Kurt Eichenwald is the author to include.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Maybe it's better to stick with what's explicitly mentioned. Since the input includes Kurt Eichenwald and mentions other reporters in a general sense without names, I should only include him as an author.

But wait, looking back at the user's example response, they included multiple authors with nulls for some. So perhaps we need to list all possible individual contributors, but since none are named beyond Kurt, maybe he's the only one.

Alternatively, if there are mentions of "reporters" in general without names, maybe we can include them as name: null entries, but I'm not sure if that's necessary. The user said not to make up names, so perhaps it's better to only include Kurt Eichenwald and leave others out unless specified.

Now, the JSON structure:

- id: "T1595"
- authors: [
  {
    "name": "Kurt Eichenwald",
    "email": null,
    "affiliation": "The New York Times"
  },
  {
    "name": null,
    "email": null,
    "affiliation": null
  }
]
Wait, but why include an author with all nulls? That doesn't make sense. Maybe the user intended that if there are multiple authors mentioned, each gets an entry, even if some details are null.

But in this case, since only Kurt Eichenwald is a named author, perhaps he's the only one to include. Alternatively, maybe the other resources imply other authors, but without names, it's unclear.

I think it's safer to include all possible authors mentioned by name. So just Kurt Eichenwald in this case.

Moving on:

- conference: "Not Listed"
- year: "Not Listed"
- title: same as provided
- description: 1-2 sentences summarizing the content.
- keywords: five relevant terms.

I think that's it. Now, putting all together into a JSON object.
