Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) tipsheet. The input provided includes details about appropriations bills, associated reports, clerks, hearings, press contacts, and some websites.

First, I'll start by identifying each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The id is given as T1864, so that's straightforward.

For the authors, the text mentions David Rogers from WSJ. So, the authors list should include him with his affiliation as The Wall Street Journal. Since there are no other authors mentioned, the list has only one entry.

Conference is IRE because the user specified it's an IRE conference tipsheet.

The year isn't explicitly provided in the text, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

The title should reflect the main topic, which is about appropriations bills and how they're structured. So, something like "Understanding Appropriations Bills: A Reporterâ€™s Guide" makes sense.

For the description, it needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet explains the structure of federal funding through 13 annual bills, each with its own reports and details on earmarks. Also, it mentions the importance of reading both bills and reports for comprehensive reporting.

Keywords should capture the main elements without including the conference or authors. So, terms like "appropriations bills", "federal budget", "congressional reporting", "earmarks", and "government spending" are appropriate.

I'll make sure all values are in English, as per instructions, and enclose keys and values in quotes. Since no other authors are listed, the rest of the authors array will be empty.

Now, putting it all together, I structure each key with its corresponding value, ensuring that arrays like authors and keywords are correctly formatted.
