Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's input. The input includes details about an event or presentation by Margot Williams at NICAR in 2019 titled "Research Tools & Tips." 

First, let's break down what each part of the JSON should include.

The id is given as 5814, so that's straightforward. Next, authors should be a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. The only author mentioned here is Margot Williams, her email is provided (margot.williams@nytimes.com), and she's affiliated with The New York Times.

The conference is NICAR, which stands for the National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting, so that fits under the "conference" key. The year is 2019 since that's when NICAR 2019 took place.

For the title, it's clearly "Research Tools & Tips." 

The description needs to be a concise summary of what this presentation covers. From the input, I can see that Margot Williams presented various research tools and techniques useful for investigative journalism, including OSINT resources, document collections, and web tools. So, summarizing that into one or two sentences would work.

Keywords should be no more than five terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking through the content, relevant keywords could be "research tools," "investigative journalism," "OSINT," "NICAR 2019," but since NICAR is already the conference, maybe I can replace that with something else like "document collections" or "web tools." Wait, the user mentioned not to include the conference and authors in keywords. So, perhaps "research tools," "investigative journalism techniques," "OSINT resources," "document collections," and "web tools."

Putting it all together, each part maps neatly into the JSON structure as specified.
