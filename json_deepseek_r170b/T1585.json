Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tip sheet from an IRE conference. Let's break down the problem.

First, looking at the input, it's about tracking corporate lobbying by Bob Young from Public Citizen’s Congress Watch. The event is an IRE Regional Conference in Washington D.C., January 26, 2002.

The id is T1585 as specified. Next, for authors, there's only one person mentioned: Bob Young. His email and affiliation are provided, so the authors array will have one object with his details.

Conference is clearly "IRE". Year is given as 2002, so that's straightforward.

Title is "Tracking Corporate Lobbying." The description needs to be a concise summary. I'll mention how the tip sheet helps journalists track corporate influence through lobbying reports and mentions some challenges in the disclosure system.

Keywords should include terms like "corporate lobbying," "lobbying disclosure," "revolving door lobbyists," "Public Citizen," and "Congress Watch."

I need to ensure all keys are in quotes, and values are properly formatted. No markdown, just plain JSON.
