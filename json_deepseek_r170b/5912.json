Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the id: it's given as 5912, so that goes in straightforwardly.

Next are the authors. There are three speakers mentioned: Josh Hinkle, Darla Cameron, and Gabriel Dance. Their affiliations are KXAN, Texas Tribune, and New York Times respectively. I don't see any emails listed for them, so those fields will be null. So each author object will have their name, affiliation, and email as null.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE since the tipsheet mentions it's from an IRE conference. The year isn't provided in the text, so I'll set that to "Not Listed".

For the title, the main headings are "Making Data Investigations" and "Shine On Multiple Platforms". Combining these into one concise title makes sense: "Making Data Investigations Shine On Multiple Platforms".

The description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet talks about presenting data across different platforms like video, podcast, web, etc., so I'll summarize that it covers strategies for effectively presenting data investigations on various media.

Keywords should capture the main topics without including the conference or authors. So terms like "data presentation", "multimedia storytelling", and "platform-specific editing" fit well. Adding "user experience" and "data visualization" as they're relevant to the content.

Putting it all together, I structure each key with appropriate values ensuring correct data types and formatting.
