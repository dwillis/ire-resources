Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given input about an investigative reporting tipsheet from IRE conferences. Let me break down what's needed.

First, the user has provided a Spanish document outlining tips for conducting international investigations by Oscar Corral at the 2007 IRE conference in Phoenix, AZ. They want this information transformed into a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The ID is given as 3021, so that's straightforward. 

For the authors, it needs to be a list where each element has name, email, and affiliation. The example provided only mentions Oscar Corral without an email or affiliation, so I'll set those to null.

Conference should be "IRE" since it's from their annual conference.

Year is clearly 2007 as mentioned in the text.

Title is given as "Haciendo investigaciones internacionales / Conducting International Investigations". Since the JSON requires English unless the original is different, but the title is bilingual, I'll keep both parts as they are.

Description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers preparing for international investigations, including research, local assistance, language skills, government contacts, document requests, and cultural considerations. So the description can succinctly mention these points.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords could be "international investigations", "investigative reporting", "research techniques", "government contacts", "cultural considerations".

Now, I'll structure all this into a JSON object ensuring proper syntax with quotation marks around keys and string values, and correct data types for lists and nulls.

  "id": 3021,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Oscar Corral",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2007,
  "title": "Haciendo investigaciones internacionales / Conducting International Investigations",
  "description": "This tipsheet provides guidance on conducting international investigations, covering preparation, research techniques, local assistance, language skills, government contacts, document requests, and cultural considerations.",
  "keywords": [
    "international investigations",
    "investigative reporting",
    "research techniques",
    "government contacts",
