Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conferences. The user has specific instructions for each key.

First, the id is given as 5182, so that's straightforward.

Next, authors are listed with name, email, and affiliation. The text mentions Rich Read, Teddy Nykiel, Alex Richards, and Drex Heikes from NerdWallet. I'll include all of them, noting their emails if provided.

Conference is clearly IRE since it was presented at #IRE17 in Phoenix.

Year is 2017 as the event took place in June that year.

The title should capture the main topic: investigating student loan debt relief scams.

For description, a concise summary: Exposing companies exploiting borrowers with illegal fees and practices, plus resources for journalists to investigate further.

Keywords need to be relevant and up to five. I'll choose "student loans", "debt relief scams", "investigative reporting", "consumer protection", and "financial fraud".

Now, structuring all this into the required JSON format without any markdown.
