Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. They provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me parse through the information step by step.

First, I'll identify the id as "T2331" since that's specified in the input. Next, for authors, there are two names mentioned: Jeff Harris and Matt Goldberg. Their affiliations are KPIX-TV – San Francisco and KNBC-TV – Los Angeles, respectively. No emails are provided, so those fields will be null.

The conference is clearly IRE, as indicated by "IRE Computer-Assisted Reporting Conference". The year is 2005 since the event took place in March of that year. The title of the tipsheet is "Using CAR for Quick Investigations".

Now, for the description, it needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet provides resources and tools for journalists using computer-assisted reporting, so I'll phrase it to reflect that.

Keywords should include relevant terms like "CAR", "investigations", "data search", "public records", and "journalism tools". These capture the essence of the content without overlapping with conference or author names.

I need to ensure all fields are in English and properly quoted. Also, any missing information like emails will remain null as per instructions.
