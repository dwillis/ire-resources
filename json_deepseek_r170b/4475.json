Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conferences. The user provided detailed instructions with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, looking at the input text, there's no explicit mention of the conference name or year. So I'll set "conference" to "Not Listed" and "year" to "Not Listed".

Next, for the "authors" array, each author should have a name, email, and affiliation. The input includes names like Michael Surcombe from BBC Wales, Ashleyanne Krigbaum from KALW, Kenny Malone from WLRN-Miami Herald News, Joe Rosenberg from Snap Judgment, and Elizabeth Bowie from CBC. Their emails aren't provided, so I'll set those to null. Affiliations are clear from the text.

The "title" is given as "Tips from the audio trenches".

For the "description", it should be a 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. The tipsheet discusses using transcripts and auto-transcripts for efficiency and content creation, so I'll craft a concise description covering that.

"Keywords" need to be up to five terms. From the text, relevant keywords are "audio", "transcripts", "journalism tools", "transcription software", and "media production".

Putting it all together, I structure each part carefully, ensuring no made-up names or incorrect affiliations. Finally, I format everything into a JSON object as per the user's specifications.
