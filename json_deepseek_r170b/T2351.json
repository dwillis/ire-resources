Alright, let me try to figure this out. So, the user has provided some detailed input about creating a JSON object from a tipsheet by IRE conferences. They want a response that's only a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, I need to parse the given text. The tipsheet is titled "Ten questions editors should ask on computer-assisted reporting" by David Boardman from The Seattle Times and Richard Galant from Newsday. 

Looking at the structure, the id is T2351 as specified. For authors, each should have name, email, and affiliation. Since emails aren't provided, I'll leave them null. Affiliations are clearly mentioned: The Seattle Times and Newsday.

The conference isn't explicitly stated, but given that it's from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE), the conference key should be "IRE". The year isn't listed in the text, so it will be "Not Listed".

For the title, I'll use the exact title provided. The description needs to be a concise summary. It should mention that these are questions editors should consider when deciding whether to use CAR and how to implement it effectively.

Keywords should include terms like computer-assisted reporting, data analysis, journalism, and investigative reporting, but limited to five. I'll avoid including the conference name or authors as keywords.

I need to make sure all keys and values are in English and enclosed in quotes. Also, no markdown should be used since the response is only JSON.

Double-checking everything: id is correct, authors have their affiliations, conference is set to "IRE", year is defaulting correctly, title is accurate, description is concise, and keywords are relevant without exceeding five terms.

I think that covers all the requirements. Time to structure this into a proper JSON object.

```json
{
  "id": "T2351",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "David Boardman",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Seattle Times"
    },
    {
      "name": "Richard Galant",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Newsday"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Ten questions editors should ask on computer-assisted reporting",
  "description": "A tipsheet outlining key questions editors should consider when deciding whether to use computer-assisted reporting (CAR) and how to implement it effectively.",
  "keywords": ["computer-assisted reporting", "data analysis", "journalism", "investigative reporting"]
}
```
