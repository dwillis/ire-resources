Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user has provided some detailed information from what looks like an IRE conference tipsheet about Excel and Access User Defined Functions by Phil Harbord. They want me to generate a JSON object based on specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, the id is given as 3223, so that's straightforward. Next, for the authors, I see Phil Harbord listed with contact info. His email is pharbord@rogers.com and affiliation is Bosloe/CBC. I'll structure this into an array of objects with name, email, and affiliation.

The conference is NICAR, which I need to capitalize as per the example. The year isn't explicitly mentioned here, so I'll set it to "Not Listed". 

For the title, it's clearly stated as "NICAR - Excel / Access User Defined Functions". 

The description needs to be a concise summary of 1-2 sentences. The tipsheet introduces VBA for creating custom functions in Excel and Access, highlighting their use in data manipulation without teaching full VBA programming.

Keywords should include terms like VBA, Excel, Access, User Defined Functions, and Visual Basic. I'll list up to five relevant ones excluding the conference name and authors.

I also need to ensure all values are enclosed in quotes and in English unless specified otherwise. Since there's no year provided, I stick with "Not Listed".

Putting it all together, the JSON should accurately reflect each part of the tipsheet without adding any made-up information.
