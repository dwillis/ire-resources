Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The user provided specific instructions, so I'll go through each step carefully.

First, the ID is given as 3564, which I should include exactly. Next, the authors section requires a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the input, there are no author names mentioned, so I'll set name to null for both entries since only two are expected based on the example.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE" in the title, so that's straightforward. The year isn't explicitly provided in the text, but looking at the footers, all slides are dated 6/29/2011, which I'll use as the year.

For the title, the main heading is "Uncovering Waste and Fraud in Local Government and Public Authorities," with a subtitle about 7 easy steps. I'll combine these into one string for clarity.

The description needs to be concise, summarizing the content. The tipsheet provides steps on investigating local government waste and fraud using public records, legal strategies, and narrative techniques. That's a good summary in two sentences.

Keywords should be up to five relevant terms excluding conference and authors. From the content, appropriate keywords are "public records," "fraud," "local government," "investigative reporting," and "transparency."

I also need to ensure all keys are enclosed in quotes and values are in English as per instructions. No made-up names or affiliations should be added if not present.

Putting it all together, I structure the JSON with these elements, ensuring correct syntax without any markdown formatting.

    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
