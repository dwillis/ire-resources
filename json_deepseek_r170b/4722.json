Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let's break down what each key requires.

First, the id is given as 4722, so that's straightforward.

Next, authors: The document mentions María Ines Zamudio with her Twitter handle @mizamudio. There's no email or affiliation listed, just a name and Twitter handle. So I'll set name to "María Ines Zamudio", email and affiliation to null since they aren't provided.

Conference is IRE because the tipsheet is from an IRE conference.

The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the text, so it should be "Not Listed".

For the title, the main heading is "FOIA Blues", which seems appropriate.

Description needs a 1-2 sentence summary. The document provides tips on filing FOIAs, dealing with denials, and resources for journalists. So I'll summarize that it's about strategies and resources for effectively using Freedom of Information Act requests.

Keywords should be up to five terms related to the content: "FOIA", "Transparency", "Investigative Journalism", "Government Records", "Open Records Laws".

I think that covers all the keys without making up any information. Now, let me structure this into JSON.

```json
{
  "id": 4722,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "#FOIA blues",
  "description": "Tipsheet on filing FOIAs, dealing with denials and resources for journalists.",
  "keywords": ["FOIA", "Transparency", "Investigative Journalism", "Government Records", "Open Records Laws"]
}
```
