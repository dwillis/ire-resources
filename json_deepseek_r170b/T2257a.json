Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided slides from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me go through each slide step by step.

First, the title of the presentation is "The Crime Beat: The Data & Stats of Injustice" by David A. Milliron from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. His contact info is dmilliron@ajc.com or 404-526-5348. So for the authors section, I'll include his name, email, and affiliation as The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

The conference is IRE since it's mentioned in the input as an IRE conference tipsheet. The year isn't specified here, so I'll put "Not Listed". 

For the description, I need a concise summary. Looking at the slides, they cover sources of crime data, types of records kept by agencies, how to access and use that data, creating databases, and specific examples from the AJC's work. So the description could be about using public records and data analysis for crime reporting.

Keywords should include terms like "crime reporting", "public records", "data analysis", etc., but limited to five. I'll pick the most relevant ones.

Putting it all together, each part of the JSON object is filled out based on the information from the slides.
