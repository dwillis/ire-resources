Okay, so I need to help create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with certain keys like id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, I should identify each of these elements from the text. The ID is given as T2110. The author's name is Mary Ellen Klas, who is affiliated with The Miami Herald. Her email isn't provided, so that will be null. 

The conference is clearly stated as the IRE Annual Conference, held in Atlanta, GA, on June 18, 2004. So the year is 2004, and the location is Atlanta. 

The title of the tipsheet is "Government Contracts." The description needs to be a concise summary of what the tipsheet covers. From the content, it's about investigating government contracts by following money trails, checking procurement rules, minority contractors, political connections, and asking key questions.

For keywords, I need up to five relevant terms excluding the conference name and authors. Looking at the content, suitable keywords would be "government contracts," "procurement," "minority contractors," "political contributors," and "contract oversight."

I should structure all of this into a JSON object with the specified keys, ensuring that values are correctly formatted and enclosed in quotes. I'll make sure not to include any markdown or extra text outside the JSON.
