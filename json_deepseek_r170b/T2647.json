Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has provided specific instructions, so I should follow them carefully.

First, the id is T2647, as specified. Next, looking at the authors section, there's only one author mentioned: Danielle Cervantes. Her email is danielle.cervantes@uniontrib.com, and her affiliation is The San Diego Union-Tribune. So I'll structure the authors array with these details.

The conference isn't explicitly mentioned in the text, but since it's from IRE, I can set the conference key to "IRE". The year isn't provided, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

For the title, the tipsheet is titled "Excel for Beginners: Geek Glossary", which I'll include. The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers Excel basics like cell references, functions, formulas, and specific calculations, so I can write that it explains fundamental concepts for using Excel in investigative reporting.

Keywords should be no more than five terms related to the content but excluding the conference and authors. Looking at the material, relevant keywords are "Excel", "formulas", "functions", "data analysis", and "spreadsheets".

Putting it all together, I'll structure each key accordingly, ensuring proper formatting and enclosure within quotes as per JSON standards.
