Okay, so I have to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through this step by step.

First, looking at the input, it's in Spanish, but I need to produce everything in English unless the original is different. The id is given as 2864, so that's straightforward.

Next, authors: there's a name listed, Noemí Ramírez, who is the Jefa de Documentación at El Mundo. Her email and phone number are provided, but for the JSON, I only need her name, email, and affiliation. So the authors array will have one object with her details.

The conference mentioned is "Conferencia de Periodismo Global" in Copenhagen from April 26-29, 2001. Since it's not an IRE or NICAR event, the conference key should be "Not Listed". The year is clearly 2001, so that goes into the year field.

The title of the tipsheet seems to be "Cómo investigar a personas de frontera a frontera," which translates to "How to Investigate People Across Borders." I'll use that as the title.

For the description, it needs to be a concise summary. The document talks about tracking people, developing leads, using alert services, and provides various resources for journalists. So the description should mention these elements in 1-2 sentences.

Keywords are next. Looking through the content, relevant terms include "investigative journalism," "tracking individuals," "journalist tools," "international reporting," and "research methods." I'll limit it to five keywords as instructed.

Putting it all together, making sure each key is properly enclosed in quotes and the structure follows the JSON format.
