Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. Let me break down their requirements step by step.

First, the user provided a tipsheet from an IRE conference in Phoenix, AZ in 2007. The title is "The Art and Science of Follow Ups" by Bob Segall from WTHR Indianapolis.

I have to structure this into JSON with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The ID should be 2950 as given. For the authors, it's a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. Since only Bob Segall is mentioned without an email, his entry will have name as "Bob Segall", email null, and affiliation as "WTHR Indianapolis". Others are null because there are no additional authors.

The conference is clearly IRE, so that's straightforward. The year is 2007 since it's specified in the text.

For the title, it's exactly as provided: "The Art and Science of Follow Ups".

The description needs to be a concise summary. I'll mention that the session focuses on the importance of follow-up stories, strategies for planning them, and techniques to maintain visibility. Keeping it under two sentences is key.

Keywords should be up to five terms related to the content but excluding conference and authors. So, "follow-ups", "investigative reporting", "story planning", "journalism techniques", and "media strategies" fit well.

I need to make sure all keys are enclosed in quotes and that there's no extra information beyond what's provided. Also, since email isn't listed, it remains null, and similarly for other authors which aren't present here.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON accordingly.

```json
{
  "id": 2950,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Bob Segall",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "WTHR Indianapolis"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2007,
  "title": "The Art and Science of Follow Ups",
  "description": "This session focuses on the importance of follow-up stories in investigative journalism, providing strategies for planning and executing effective follow-ups to maintain visibility and impact.",
  "keywords": [
    "follow-ups",
    "investigative reporting",
    "story planning",
    "journalism techniques",
    "media strategies"
  ]
}
```
