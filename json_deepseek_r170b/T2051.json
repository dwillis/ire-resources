Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each requirement step by step.

First, the id is given as T2051. The authors section should be a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the text, Carolyn Edds is mentioned as the IRE Research Director who developed the presentation. There's no other author listed, so the authors array will have one object with her details. Her email isn't provided, so it remains null.

Next, the conference is clearly stated as IRE since the tipsheet was presented at their annual event. The year is specified as 2004 from the dates March 11-14, 2004. 

The title should be concise. The original text mentions it's a hands-on class about Internet searching for reporters and researchers, so I'll use that as the title.

For the description, I need to summarize the content in one or two sentences. It includes various search techniques using Google, alternative tools like Switchboard, and access to public records. So, summarizing that it provides tips on advanced web searches and public record resources makes sense.

Keywords should be up to five terms, excluding conference names and authors. The main topics are internet searching, public records, investigative reporting, online research, and search techniques. These cover the essential elements without overlap.

I also need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. No other languages are involved here, so that's straightforward.

Putting it all together, I structure each key accordingly, making sure there are no markdown formats as per the user's request. Each part of the JSON is carefully populated based on the provided text.
