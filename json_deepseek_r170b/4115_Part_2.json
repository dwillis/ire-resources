Alright, I'm trying to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, the structure needs specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as "4115_Part_2". I should make sure to include that exactly.

Looking at the content provided, it seems like it's from NICAR 2014, so the conference is NICAR and the year is 2014. That makes sense because there are mentions of Boston Bombings and Edward Snowden, which were big stories around that time.

For the title, "Investigative Reporting Tips" seems appropriate since the tipsheet covers various investigative techniques like using social media and public records. 

Now, the authors section is a bit tricky. The user mentioned not to make up names and leave them as null if none are listed. Scanning through the provided content, I don't see any author names, so each entry in the authors list will have name set to null, along with email and affiliation.

The description should be a concise summary of 1-2 sentences. The tipsheet talks about using social networks, tools like Topsy and Scribd, and strategies for tracking down sources during breaking news. So I'll condense that into two simple sentences.

Keywords are next. They need to be no more than five terms. From the content, "investigative journalism", "social media", "public records", "breaking news", and "source tracking" seem relevant. I should avoid including the conference name or authors here.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with each key properly quoted and ensure that all values are in English as per the instructions. Double-checking to make sure no keys or values have typos is important for validity.

I think that's everything. Time to draft the JSON.
