Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Margot Williams at the NICAR 2014 conference. Let me break down the requirements step by step.

First, the structure should include id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is given as 4091, so that's straightforward.

Looking for the author information: Margot Williams is listed at the end with her email mwilliams@icij.org and affiliation ICIJ. So the authors array will have one object with name "Margot Williams", email "mwilliams@icij.org", and affiliation "ICIJ".

The conference is clearly stated as NICAR 2014, so conference is "NICAR" and year is 2014.

For the title, it's labeled as "NICAR 2014 Research Links". That seems appropriate to use as the title.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers various resources for investigative journalists, including data journalism tools, research databases, FOIA resources, etc. So I'll phrase that into a clear sentence or two.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Reviewing the content, relevant keywords could be "investigative journalism", "research tools", "data journalism", "FOIA resources", and "journalism resources".

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly quoted. No made-up names; since only Margot Williams is listed, that's the only author.

Putting it all together, I structure each key with the correct values, ensuring the JSON syntax is accurate.
