Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's input about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The id should be "3764" as given. 

First, looking at the authors section. There's Michael J. Berens from The Seattle Times with his email provided. So I'll list him under authors with his details.

The conference is clearly labeled as "IRE â€“ Boston 2012", so the conference key will be "IRE". The year is 2012 since it's specified in the text.

For the title, "Finding the Story" seems appropriate based on the content. 

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. It should mention that the tipsheet provides strategies for reporters to find and develop investigative stories, covering stages like scouting, research, and pitching.

Keywords are next. I'll extract relevant terms from the text: "investigative reporting", "story development", "public records", "research strategies", and "pitching".

I need to ensure all keys are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, since no other authors are mentioned, Michael J. Berens is the only one listed.

Putting it all together, I structure each part carefully to meet the user's specifications.
