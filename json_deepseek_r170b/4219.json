Okay, I need to create a JSON object from the given tipsheet. The user provided specific instructions on how to structure it with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, the id is set as 4219. Then, for the authors, there's Martha Mendoza listed with her email and affiliation as Associated Press Writer. So I'll create an array of author objects with her details.

The conference mentioned is the 2014 IRE Conference, so that goes into the conference field. The year is clearly 2014, so no problem there. 

Next, the title should be "Freedom of Information on Both Sides of the Border". 

For the description, it needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers both US and Mexico FOIA processes, so I'll mention that along with some key points about agencies and requests.

Keywords are up to five terms. From the content, relevant keywords include FOIA, immigration, border issues, transparency, and cross-border reporting.

I need to make sure all values are in English unless specified otherwise, but everything here is in English. Also, each key and value should be enclosed in quotes as per JSON standards.

Let me structure it step by step:

- Start with id: 4219
- Authors array with one object containing name, email, affiliation
- Conference: "IRE"
- Year: 2014
- Title: "Freedom of Information on Both Sides of the Border"
- Description: A concise summary about using FOIA in US and Mexico for investigative reporting.
- Keywords: selected relevant terms

I think that covers all the requirements. Now, I'll assemble it into a proper JSON format ensuring correct syntax with commas and brackets.

```json

    {
      "name": "Martha Mendoza",

    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2014,
  "title": "Freedom of Information on Both Sides of the Border",
  "description": "This tipsheet provides guidance for using Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests in both the United States and Mexico, including specific agencies to target and tips for making effective requests.",
  "keywords": ["FOIA", "immigration", "border issues", "transparency", "cross-border reporting"]
}
