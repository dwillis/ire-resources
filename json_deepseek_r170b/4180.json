Okay, so I have to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an IRE Conference. Let me read through the query carefully.

First, the user wants a response that's only a JSON object describing the tipsheet. The tip sheet is about conducting on-camera interviews, specifically dealing with politicians and government employees.

I need to structure the JSON with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The id should be 4180 as provided. 

Looking at the authors section, it's a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. The tipsheet mentions Mike Deeson with his contact info. So I'll include him as an author with his name, email, and affiliation as WTSP since that's the domain in his email.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE Conference 2014, so conference is "IRE" and year is 2014.

For title, it's "Digging Deeper with On-Camera Interviews".

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet focuses on strategies for conducting scheduled and unscheduled interviews, emphasizing preparation and handling difficult subjects. So I'll write that it offers techniques for both types of interviews and how to handle challenging situations.

Keywords should be up to five terms related to the content but excluding conference and authors. From the text, relevant keywords are: "on-camera interviews", "unscheduled interviews", "PIOs", "public officials", and "investigative reporting".

I have to make sure all values are in English, keys are quoted, and the structure is correct.

Let me put it all together ensuring each part aligns with the requirements.
