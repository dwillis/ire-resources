Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has provided specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, let's break down the input. The title of the session is "Alcohol and Journalism: How I Started Drinking Less, Sleeping More and Being Less of a General Shitshow (and How You Can Too, If You Want)." The speaker is Rachel Alexander from The Spokesman-Review, and her Twitter handle is @rachelwalexande. 

The content discusses why journalists tend to drink, suggests being mindful of drinking habits, and provides resources for those who want to cut down on alcohol. It also includes a link to an alcohol tracking sheet and NIH recommendations.

Now, according to the instructions, I need to form a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

1. **id**: The user specified it should be "5442_1".
2. **authors**: A list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. Since only Rachel Alexander is mentioned, I'll include her. Her name is given, but there's no email provided, so that will be null. Her affiliation is The Spokesman-Review.
3. **conference**: It's an IRE conference, as indicated by the context.
4. **year**: The input doesn't specify the year, so it should be "Not Listed".
5. **title**: Copied directly from the session title provided.
6. **description**: Needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. It should capture that journalists often drink and the talk offers ways to cut down.
7. **keywords**: Up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Relevant keywords could be "alcohol use", "journalism culture", "mindfulness", "health", "behavior change".

Putting it all together, I structure each key with appropriate values, ensuring that strings are in quotes and proper formatting is maintained.
