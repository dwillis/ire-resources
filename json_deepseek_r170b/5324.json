Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. They provided a detailed tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference titled "THE INVESTIGATIVE INTERVIEW" by Tony Pipitone of NBC 6-Miami.

First, let's identify each required key:

- **id**: Given as 5324.
- **authors**: A list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. Since only Tony Pipitone is mentioned, his email isn't provided, so it'll be null. Affiliation is NBC 6-Miami.
- **conference**: Clearly IRE since the tipsheet mentions IRE conferences.
- **year**: Not specified in the text, so "Not Listed".
- **title**: The title is "THE INVESTIGATIVE INTERVIEW".
- **description**: A concise summary. The tipsheet focuses on strategies for effective investigative interviews, including preparation and handling difficult subjects.
- **keywords**: Up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Relevant keywords are "investigative journalism", "interview techniques", "accountability", "media", "public employees".

Now, I'll structure all these into a JSON object, ensuring each value is correctly formatted and enclosed in quotes.
