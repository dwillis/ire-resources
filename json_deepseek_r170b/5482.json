Okay, I need to create a JSON object from the given input based on specific instructions. Let me break down what's required.

First, the id should be 5482. That's straightforward.

Next, authors are listed with name, email, and affiliation. The input shows Paul Overberg from The Wall Street Journal, and his email is poverberg2@gmail.com. So I can fill that in without any issues.

The conference is either IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed. Looking at the input, it's from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference, so I'll set conference to "IRE". The year isn't explicitly mentioned, so I'll leave it as "Not Listed".

For the title, the input has "Demographics: Beyond Census", which is perfect.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers various demographic data sources like NHGIS, CDC Wonder, Social Security beneficiaries, etc., so I'll summarize that it provides resources for exploring detailed demographic statistics beyond the standard census data.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. So I'll list: "demographics", "NHGIS", "CDC Wonder", "Social Security beneficiaries", "IRS migration".

Putting it all together, each key needs to be in quotes, and the JSON structure must be correct with proper commas and brackets.

```json
{
  "id": 5482,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Paul Overberg",
      "email": "poverberg2@gmail.com",
      "affiliation": "The Wall Street Journal"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Demographics: Beyond Census",
  "description": "A tipsheet covering various demographic data sources such as NHGIS, CDC Wonder, and Social Security beneficiaries to explore detailed statistics beyond the standard census data.",
  "keywords": [
    "demographics",
    "NHGIS",
    "CDC Wonder",
    "Social Security beneficiaries",
    "IRS migration"
  ]
}
```
