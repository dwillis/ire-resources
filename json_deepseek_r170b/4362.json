Alright, I need to create a JSON object from the provided tipsheet about pivot tables. The user specified several keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. 

First, the id is given as 4362, so that's straightforward.

Next, for authors, I see Jonathan Stoneman listed with his email but no explicit affiliation mentioned. Since there's no news organization or other entity provided, I'll set affiliation to null.

The conference is NICAR, as it's a NICAR Tipsheet, so that goes under conference. The year isn't clearly stated in the text, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

The title is clearly "PIVOT TABLES – NICAR Tipsheet". 

For the description, I need a concise summary. It should mention what pivot tables are and their main uses, like manipulating data, sorting, filtering, etc.

Keywords should include terms relevant to the content but exclude conference and authors. So I'll choose "pivot tables", "Excel", "data analysis", "sorting", and "filtering" as they fit well.

Putting it all together, ensuring each key is correctly formatted with quotes and proper structure.

    {
      "name": null,
      "email": "jonathan.stoneman@gmail.com",
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "PIVOT TABLES – NICAR Tipsheet",
  "description": "A guide on using pivot tables in Excel for data manipulation, including sorting, filtering, and summarizing data effectively.",
  "keywords": [
    "pivot tables",
    "Excel",
    "data analysis",
    "sorting",
    "filtering"
  ]
}
