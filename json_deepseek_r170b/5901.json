Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, let's identify each part step by step.

1. **id**: It should be 5901 as per the instruction.
2. **authors**: This is a list of objects, each containing name, email, and affiliation. I see two speakers mentioned: Charles Ornstein from ProPublica and Amanda Latimore, PhD from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. So, both will be included in the authors array.

   - For Charles Ornstein:
     - Name: "Charles Ornstein"
     - Email: Not provided in the text, so it'll be null.
     - Affiliation: ProPublica (since it's listed next to his name).

   - For Amanda Latimore:
     - Name: "Amanda Latimore, PhD"
     - Email: alatimore@jhu.edu is mentioned under her contact info.
     - Affiliation: Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

3. **conference**: The text mentions it's from an IRE conference, so the value will be "IRE".

4. **year**: The year isn't explicitly stated in the provided text, so according to instructions, it should be "Not Listed".

5. **title**: The title given is "Using Publicly Available Data for Investigative Reporting", which seems appropriate.

6. **description**: This needs to be a concise 1-2 sentence summary of the tipsheet. The tipsheet focuses on using public data in investigative journalism, particularly regarding opioid issues, so I can craft it as: "A guide on utilizing publicly available data sources for investigating opioid-related topics and policies."

7. **keywords**: These should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords could be "opioid data", "public health", "investigative reporting", "Medicare", "Medicaid". These capture the essence without including the conference or author names.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each key with appropriate values as per the instructions. Ensuring that emails and affiliations are correctly placed under each author.
