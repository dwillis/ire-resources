Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided input. Let's break down what's required.

First, the user has given me some specific instructions about what keys to include: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is fixed at 4155, which seems straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors section. I see three email addresses with affiliations mentioned right after them: Richard T. from IRE Conference, Brandi Grissom from Texas Tribune, and Eric Nalder from IRE Conference. So each author should have their name extracted from the email, email address included, and affiliation as listed.

The conference key needs to be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Since both Richard T. and Eric Nalder are from IRE Conference, and Brandi Grissom is from Texas Tribune, which doesn't correspond directly to a conference but might still fall under "IRE" if that's the main event. However, the instructions say to choose between those three options based on the event. Since it's not explicitly stated as NICAR or another, I'll go with "IRE".

For the year, there's no specific mention in the provided text, so according to instructions, it should be "Not Listed".

The title is given at the top of the input: "Reporting on Death Penalty".

Description needs a 1-2 sentence summary. The document provides tips and resources for journalists reporting on capital punishment cases, including legal challenges, victim impact, and execution protocols.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords would be "death penalty", "journalism", "investigative reporting", "capital punishment", and "execution".

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part step by step ensuring no made-up names and proper handling of nulls where necessary.
