Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tip sheet from the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the id is given as 5894, so that's straightforward. Next, looking at the authors section: there are three names with emails and affiliations listed. Miles Moffeit has an email and affiliation, Sarah Smith as well, and Anjali Kamat too. I'll list each author with their name, email, and affiliation.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE 2019, so the conference key will be "IRE" and the year is 2019. The title of the tip sheet is about navigating trauma in abuse investigations, so I'll summarize that for the title field.

For the description, it needs to be a concise summary. The tip sheet focuses on understanding victim psychology and building trust with survivors through TLCâ€”transparency, listening, compassion. It also covers interview techniques and self-care for journalists. So I'll craft a 1-2 sentence summary that captures these elements.

Keywords should include trauma, abuse investigations, PTSD, survivor interviewing, and investigative journalism. These terms are central to the content without including the conference or authors.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Each key is also in quotes as per JSON standards. I'll structure everything accordingly, making sure there are no made-up names and that affiliations are correctly pulled from the provided emails if possible.
