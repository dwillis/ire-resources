Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about a tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors conferences. The user provided some detailed notes from what seems like a conference session titled "How To Follow The Money" at IRE 2016.

First, I'll break down the requirements:

1. **id**: Should be 4865 as specified.
2. **authors**: A list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. If no names are listed, leave name null. Affiliation can be a news org if mentioned.
3. **conference**: It's either IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed. In this case, it's clearly IRE 2016.
4. **year**: The year is given as 2016, so that's straightforward.
5. **title**: The title of the tipsheet, which seems to be "How To Follow The Money".
6. **description**: A concise summary in 1-2 sentences. It should explain what the session is about in simple terms.
7. **keywords**: Up to five relevant terms excluding conference and authors.

Looking at the content provided:

- The session focuses on using resources from FollowTheMoney.org, which is affiliated with the National Institute On Money In State Politics (NIMSP).
- Tools and techniques discussed include tracking contributions, independent spending, lobbying expenditures, and connecting legislative data.
- Denise Roth Barber is mentioned as Managing Director with her contact info. Since she's part of NIMSP, that will be her affiliation.

Now, putting it all together:

- **id**: 4865
- **authors**: Only Denise Roth Barber is listed. Her email and affiliation are provided.
- **conference**: IRE
- **year**: 2016
- **title**: "How To Follow The Money"
- **description**: Should capture the essence, like using tools from FollowTheMoney.org to track money in politics.
- **keywords**: campaign finance, lobbying data, political contributions, etc.

I need to ensure all fields are correctly formatted and enclosed in quotes. Also, make sure not to include any extra info beyond what's necessary. 

Double-checking if there are other authors: No, only Denise is mentioned. So the authors list will have one entry with her details.
