Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on this tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, the id is given as 3466, which is straightforward. Next, for authors, I see that there are no specific names mentioned in the text. So, I'll set authors to an empty array since we can't make up any names.

The conference is clearly IRE because the tipsheet includes their copyright information multiple times. The year listed is 2011, so I'll include that as well.

The title should be "Valet parking your Django app," which is at the top of the document. For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet compares Djangy and ep.io for deploying Django apps, highlighting their pros, cons, setup, updates, and troubleshooting steps. So, I'll write that it's a comparison guide focusing on these aspects.

Keywords should be no more than five terms. From the content, relevant keywords are "Django," "Djangy," "ep.io," "deployment," and "cloud hosting." These capture the main topics discussed.

I also need to make sure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Since there's no mention of authors or other specific details beyond what's provided, I'll leave those fields as null or empty where necessary.

```json
{
  "id": "3466",
  "authors": [],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2011",
  "title": "Valet parking your Django app",
  "description": "A guide comparing Djangy and ep.io for deploying Django applications, including setup steps, pros, cons, updates, and troubleshooting tips.",
  "keywords": ["Django", "Djangy", "ep.io", "deployment", "cloud hosting"]
}
```
