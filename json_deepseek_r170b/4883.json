Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet by Topher Sanders. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, the structure of the JSON should have specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is given as 4883. 

Looking at the content, the author is clearly Topher Sanders from ProPublica. His email and Twitter handle are provided, but since the user mentioned not to make up any names and to leave fields null if not present, I'll fill in his name, email, and set affiliation to ProPublica.

The conference is IRE 2016 in New Orleans, so the year should be 2016. The title of the tipsheet seems to be "Uncovering Stories on the Criminal Justice Beat."

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet covers various strategies like requesting legal settlements, data from state attorneys, and using public records. So I'll craft a 1-2 sentence summary highlighting these points.

Keywords should be up to five relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. I'll pick "criminal justice," "police settlements," "public records," "investigative reporting," and "data journalism."

I also need to ensure all values are in English, keys are enclosed in quotes, and no markdown is used. Let me structure this properly without any extra formatting.
