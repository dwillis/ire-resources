Okay, so I'm trying to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on how each part should be structured.

First, I need to extract the necessary information from the input text. The ID is T2644 as specified. Next, the authors section requires a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. The tipsheet mentions Nancy Amons from WSMV Nashville, along with her contact info: 615-353-2284 and namons@wsmv.com. So I'll include that.

The conference is IRE since it's from an IRE event. The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the text provided, so according to the instructions, it should be "Not Listed". The title of the tipsheet is given as "2006 CAR for Broadcast: Using Health Care Data".

For the description, it needs to be a concise 1-2 sentence summary. I'll focus on how data analysis exposed issues in TennCare, mentioning prescription abuse and transportation costs.

Keywords should be up to five terms related to the content, excluding conference and authors. So I'll include "health care", "data journalism", "Medicaid", "prescription drug abuse", and "government accountability".

I need to make sure all values are enclosed in quotes and that the structure follows JSON syntax correctly without any markdown formatting.

Let me double-check each part:

- ID: T2644
- Authors: Only Nancy Amons with her details.
- Conference: IRE
- Year: Not Listed
- Title: Correctly extracted.
- Description: Concise summary.
- Keywords: Five relevant terms.

I think that covers all the requirements. Now, putting it all together into a JSON object as specified.
