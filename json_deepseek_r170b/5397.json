Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided input with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, I'll start by identifying each component from the user's instructions.

The ID is given as 5397. That's straightforward.

Next, looking for authors. The input text mentions several resources and guides but doesn't explicitly list any author names. Since no names are provided, the authors array will consist of null values for name, email, and affiliation.

For the conference, the user mentioned "NICAR18" at the beginning, so I'll set the conference key to "NICAR".

The year is "2018" because NICAR18 refers to the 2018 conference.

The title should be a concise summary of the document. The text covers various security tools and best practices for journalists, so I'll go with "Digital Security Resources and Tools for Journalists".

Now, the description needs to be a brief summary in simple language. It's about resources and guides on digital security, encryption, and secure communication methods for journalists.

Finally, keywords should be up to five relevant terms. From the text, "digital security", "encryption", "journalism", "secure communication", and "privacy" are appropriate.

I'll structure all these into a JSON object with proper syntax, ensuring all keys and string values are enclosed in double quotes.

```json
{
  "id": "5397",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2018",
  "title": "Digital Security Resources and Tools for Journalists",
  "description": "A collection of resources and guides on digital security, encryption, and secure communication methods for journalists.",
  "keywords": [
    "digital security",
    "encryption",
    "journalism",
    "secure communication",
    "privacy"
  ]
}
```
