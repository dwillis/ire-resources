Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. The input provided seems to be instructions for how to track political fundraisers and lobbying activities using FEC records and other sources.

First, I'll identify the required keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The id is given as 3099, so that's straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors. The text doesn't mention any specific names, so I'll set each author's name to null. Since there are no emails or affiliations provided either, those will be null as well.

For conference, since it's about investigative reporting techniques, I think "IRE" makes sense because IRE stands for Investigative Reporters and Editors, which fits the context of tracking political activities.

The year isn't specified in the text, so I'll mark that as "Not Listed".

Now, the title should be a concise summary. The main focus is on tracking fundraisers and lobbying using FEC records, so I'll use "Tracking Political Fundraisers and Lobbying Activities Using FEC Records".

The description needs to be 1-2 sentences in simple terms. It should summarize how FEC records help track political activities.

Keywords are next. I need up to five terms. Important concepts here are FEC records, lobbying, political contributions, campaign finance, and investigative journalism.

Putting it all together, ensuring each key is properly formatted with quotes and values as specified.
