Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an IRE conference. Let me start by understanding what each part of the query requires.

First, the id is given as 5260, so that's straightforward. Next, authors. The tipsheet mentions Matt Dempsey from the Houston Chronicle for IRE 2017. So, his name is Matt Dempsey, email and affiliation are not provided. Since the affiliation isn't listed next to his name but he's from the Houston Chronicle, I can use that as his affiliation.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE 2017, so the conference key will be "IRE" and the year is 2017. The title of the tipsheet is "Finding hidden hazards near you."

For the description, it should be a concise summary. The main idea is about identifying chemical hazards in local areas using various resources like Risk Management Plans, Tier II reports, EPA data, etc. So I'll craft a one-sentence summary that captures this.

Keywords need to be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking through the content, relevant keywords are "Risk Management Plan," "Tier II inventories," "EPA," "OSHA," and "LEPCs."

I should structure all of this into a JSON object with the specified keys: id, authors (as an array of objects), conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

Let me double-check each field to ensure accuracy. The authors section only has Matt Dempsey with affiliation as Houston Chronicle since that's the news organization mentioned. All other details are correctly captured.

I think that covers everything required by the query.

```json
{
  "id": 5260,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Matt Dempsey",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Houston Chronicle"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2017,
  "title": "Finding hidden hazards near you",
  "description": "A tipsheet on identifying chemical hazards in your area using Risk Management Plans, Tier II inventories, EPA data, OSHA inspections, and local emergency planning committees.",
  "keywords": [
    "Risk Management Plan",
    "Tier II inventories",
    "EPA",
    "OSHA",
    "LEPCs"
  ]
}
```
