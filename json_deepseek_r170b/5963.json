Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about social media search and verification tips from an IRE conference. The user provided a detailed structure with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, I'll assign the id as 5963 since that was specified. Next, for the authors section, Denise Malan is listed with her email denise@ire.org and affiliation IRE_NICAR. There's another Twitter handle @IRE_NICAR, but no name, so I'll set that author's name to null with the same email and affiliation.

The conference is either IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed. Since both authors are from IRE_NICAR, I'll go with "NICAR". The year isn't provided in the text, so it defaults to "Not Listed".

For the title, "Social Media Search & Verification" seems appropriate. The description needs a concise summary: maybe "Tips and tools for verifying social media accounts, photos, and videos during investigations." That covers the main points.

Keywords should be up to five terms. I'll choose "social media verification", "investigative journalism", "online search tools", "photo verification", and "video analysis" as they capture the essence without including the conference or authors.

I need to ensure all values are in English, keys are enclosed in quotes, and the JSON structure is correct. No made-up names, so null where necessary.
