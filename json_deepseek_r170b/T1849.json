Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given input. Let me first read through everything carefully.

The user provided a story tip titled “Orphaned” Radioactive Sources from an IRE conference in 2003. They specified that the response must be a JSON object with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is T1849.

Looking at the input, there's only one author mentioned, Douglas Pasternak. His details include name, email (dpasternak@usnews.com), and affiliation as Senior Editor at U.S. News & World Report. So the authors array will have one object with these attributes.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE Annual Conference in Washington, D.C., so the conference key should be "IRE". The year is 2003 since the event took place June 5-8, 2003.

For the title, it's “Orphaned” Radioactive Sources. The description needs to be a concise summary of 1-2 sentences. I'll mention that there are millions of radioactive sources in the U.S., many becoming orphaned, posing risks like economic damage and potential terrorist use.

Keywords should include relevant terms: "radioactive sources," "orphaned," "nuclear security," "terrorism," "public safety." These capture the essence without including conference or author names.

I must ensure all keys and values are in English and enclosed in quotes. No made-up data, so if any info isn't present, it's set to null. In this case, everything is provided except for other authors, so only one entry in authors.

Let me structure the JSON accordingly with these points.

```json
{
  "id": "T1849",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Douglas Pasternak",
      "email": "dpasternak@usnews.com",
      "affiliation": "Senior Editor, Investigative Team, U.S. News & World Report"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2003,
  "title": "“Orphaned” Radioactive Sources",
  "description": "An estimated 500,000 radioactive sources in the U.S. are no longer needed or wanted, posing risks of theft, misuse, and potential terrorist threats. These 'orphaned' sources often end up in junkyards, causing economic damage and security concerns.",
  "keywords": [
    "radioactive sources",
    "orphaned",
    "nuclear security",
    "terrorism",
    "public safety"
  ]
}
```
