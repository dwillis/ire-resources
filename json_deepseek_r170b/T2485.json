Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on this tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each requirement step by step.

First, the id should be T2485 as given. 

Next, for the authors list, there's only one author mentioned here: Eric Nalder. His email is listed as enalder@seattletimes.com, and his affiliation is The Seattle Times since that's the news organization he's with.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that goes in the conference field.

The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the provided text, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

For the title, the tipsheet doesn't have a specific title, so I'll use the default placeholder provided: "Investigative Reporting Tipsheet".

The description needs to be a concise summary of the content. The tipsheet is about how Eric Nalder investigated life raft safety on ferries following a tip, leading to significant policy changes. So, I can summarize that into one sentence.

Keywords should be relevant and not exceed five terms. From the context, "life rafts", "ferry safety", "investigative journalism", "policy change", and "NTSB" are all key elements mentioned in the tipsheet.

I'll make sure all keys and values are enclosed in quotes and that everything is in English since the original text is in English.

Let me put this all together now.
