Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's input following specific guidelines. Let me break down what needs to be done.

First, the structure should include id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is given as 5648.

Looking at the input, there are three presenters: Kameel Stanley, Alain Stephens, and Jacob Ryan. Each has a name, email, and affiliation. I'll list them under "authors" with their respective details.

The conference location is Orlando, but the user specified that the conference should be one of "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Since it's from an IRE event, I'll set conference to "IRE".

The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, based on my knowledge, IRE 2018 was held in Orlando. So, I can confidently set the year as 2018.

The title of the tipsheet is about doing investigations for radio and podcasts, so I'll phrase that clearly.

For the description, it needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet focuses on techniques for audio investigative journalism, so I'll mention that.

Keywords should include terms like investigation, radio, podcast, audio storytelling, FOIA, which are relevant but exclude conference and authors' names.

Putting it all together, ensuring correct formatting and that each field adheres to the guidelines.
