Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, the id is fixed at 4099, so that's straightforward.

Next, authors. Looking through the text, there's no explicit mention of any author names. So, the authors list will have an object with name set to null and email and affiliation also as null.

Conference: The tipsheet mentions it's from IRE conferences, so conference should be "IRE".

Year: The text doesn't specify a year, so it'll be "Not Listed".

Title: The main heading is about finding data outside one's home country. So the title will be "Finding Data from Other Countries".

Description: Needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet helps journalists find international data sources and techniques. I can summarize that in two sentences.

Keywords: Extracting relevant terms like data, international, sources, Google advanced search, FOIA. These are all central themes.

Putting it all together, each key is filled as per the instructions.

  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Finding Data from Other Countries",
  "description": "A tipsheet providing strategies for locating datasets outside one's home country, including using international organizations and Google search techniques.",
  "keywords": [
