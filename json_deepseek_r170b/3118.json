Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from the IRE Miami 2008 conference. The user has given specific instructions, so I have to make sure each key is correctly filled.

First, the id should be 3118 as specified. Next, the authors are Ken Armstrong and Jim Neff. Their emails and affiliations are listed, so I'll include those. The conference is clearly IRE Miami, and the year is 2008. 

For the title, "Shapeshifting" seems appropriate since that's the header in the tipsheet. The description needs to be a concise summary. I'll mention letting projects evolve from conception to delivery and highlight key points like not assuming the story and being open to change.

Keywords should include terms like investigative journalism, storytelling techniques, project development, editorial process, and reporter-editor collaboration. These capture the essence without repeating the conference or authors.

I need to structure all this into a JSON format with proper syntax, ensuring each value is enclosed in quotes and the overall structure is valid.
