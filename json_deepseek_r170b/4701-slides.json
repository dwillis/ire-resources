Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, looking at the content, it's about being a "Lonely Coder" in digital journalism. The authors listed are Scott Pham, Brent Jones, Alexandra Kanik, and Lindsey Cook. Their affiliations aren't explicitly mentioned, so I'll set those to null. 

The conference isn't directly named, but since it's related to NICAR (which is part of IRE), I'll go with "IRE" as the conference. The year isn't provided, so I'll mark that as "Not Listed".

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about resources and strategies for lone coders in newsrooms, so I'll summarize it as tools and techniques to help them succeed.

Keywords should be relevant but exclude the conference and authors. Terms like "data journalism", "digital tools", "coding", "resources", and "lone coders" fit well.

Putting it all together, I structure each part carefully to meet the user's specifications.
