Alright, I'm trying to help the user by creating a JSON object from their provided query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON, so I need to make sure each part is addressed correctly.

First, I'll identify the main sections: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 4856. For authors, there's Duff Wilson with an email and Reuters affiliation. Since Tracy Jan is mentioned without contact info, her details will be null except for her affiliation to Boston Globe.

Next, the conference is clearly IRE, held in 2016. The title of the tipsheet is "Helpless & Hooked: Drug-Dependent Newborns and Parents Who Need the Help Required by Law." 

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The main points are about underreporting of drug-dependent babies in Massachusetts, the methodology using ICD-9 codes, and the legal aspects like CAPTA. So, I'll craft that into a clear 1-2 sentence summary.

For keywords, I'll extract relevant terms: newborns, drug dependence, underreporting, child welfare, public records. These are all central to the topic without including the conference or authors.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly quoted. Also, since the year is specified as 2016, that's straightforward. 

Finally, I'll structure everything into a JSON object, making sure each key is present and correctly formatted. This should meet the user's requirements accurately.
