Alright, I'm trying to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conferences. The user has provided specific instructions on how to structure this JSON, so I need to make sure each key is correctly populated.

First, the id is straightforward—just 4399 as specified. Next, authors are listed with name, email, and affiliation. In the input, there's a mention of "@DougHaddix" and an email "Doug.Haddix@gmail.com". So, I can include Doug Haddix as the author. Since his affiliation isn't provided, it remains null.

For the conference key, the tipsheet is from an IRE event, so that's set to "IRE". The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the input, so I'll default to "Not Listed".

The title should capture the main focus of the tipsheet. Given it covers social media sleuthing techniques and tools for journalists, a suitable title would be "Social Media Sleuthing: Tips and Tools for Journalists".

Now, the description needs to be concise—1-2 sentences summarizing the content. It includes advanced search methods across platforms like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and geolocation tools. So, I'll phrase it to reflect that.

Keywords are limited to five terms, excluding conference and authors. The relevant terms here would be "social media", "investigative journalism", "advanced search", "geolocation tools", and "journalist resources". These encapsulate the main topics without overlap.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, any missing information like year or affiliation should be set as "Not Listed" or null where appropriate.

Putting it all together, I structure each key carefully, cross-referencing the input to make sure no details are missed and that everything aligns with the user's instructions.
