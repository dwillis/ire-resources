Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided document using specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The user has given me detailed instructions on how each key should be handled.

First, let's look for the ID. It seems like the main document is numbered as 5090, so I'll set "id": "5090".

Next, the authors section requires a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. The documents are from Kaas & Mulvad. Since no specific names are listed beyond the company, I should leave each author's name as null. Emails aren't provided either, so those will be null too. The affiliation is clearly "Kaas & Mulvad", so that's straightforward.

For the conference key, I need to determine if it's "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Looking through the text, there's no mention of a specific conference, so I'll set this to "Not Listed".

The year is another tricky part. The documents are from 2013 but since the user instruction says that if the event's year isn't clearly identified, use "Not Listed". Wait, in the first document snippet, it shows "1", which might correspond to a different year. I'm confused here. On closer inspection, the main content doesn't specify the year of an event, so perhaps I should set "year": "Not Listed".

The title should be derived from the content. The documents discuss finding and converting polygon data for Google Fusion Tables, so I'll craft a concise title like "Finding and Converting Polygon Data for Use in Google Fusion Tables".

Description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. The text explains how to convert shape files into KML using specific tools, so the description could mention that.

Keywords are next. They should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Relevant keywords might include "polygon data", "Google Fusion Tables", "shape files", "KML conversion", and "spatial data".

Putting it all together, I need to structure this into a JSON object with the specified keys and ensure all values are correctly formatted in English. Double-checking that all fields meet the user's criteria: no made-up names, proper affiliations where possible, correct handling of missing information, and concise descriptions.

I think I've covered each part as per the instructions. Time to assemble the JSON.

Here is the JSON object based on your request:

```json
{
  "id": "5090",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Kaas & Mulvad"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "2013",
  "title": "Finding and Converting Polygon Data for Use in Google Fusion Tables",
  "description": "This document explains how to find, convert, and use polygon data with Google Fusion Tables.",
  "keywords": ["polygon data", "Google Fusion Tables", "shape files", "KML conversion", "spatial data"]
}
```
