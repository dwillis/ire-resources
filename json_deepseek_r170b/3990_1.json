Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conferences. Let's break down each part of the query step by step.

First, the id should be "3990_1" as specified. The authors section is a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. In the input, the only author mentioned is Yang Wang with an email @yangyangyang and affiliation Houston Chronicle. So, I'll set that up accordingly, leaving email as null since it's not provided but the structure expects it.

Next, the conference key needs to be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". The tipsheet mentions it's from an IRE conference, so that's straightforward.

The year is "Not Listed" because there’s no specific year mentioned in the text. Moving on to the title, it should reflect the main topic, which is databases every newsroom should have, especially focusing on environmental and workplace safety data.

For the description, I need a concise 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet lists various datasets like environmental complaints, OSHA records, student loans, etc., so the description will highlight these key points in simple terms.

Keywords are limited to five relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking through the cases mentioned—environmental violations, OSHA inspections, student loans, municipal workers, accidents—I can extract those as keywords.

I must ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. I'll structure everything according to these requirements, making sure not to include any made-up information or extra details beyond what's provided.
