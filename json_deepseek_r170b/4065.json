Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each requirement step by step.

First, the `id` is given as 4065. That's straightforward.

Next, the `authors` section requires a list of objects with `name`, `email`, and `affiliation`. The tipsheet mentions Peter Eisler from USA TODAY, so I'll include him. His email isn't provided, so it will be null, and his affiliation is clearly USA TODAY. There are no other authors mentioned, so the list has only one entry.

The `conference` is specified as "IRE" since that's where the tipsheet originated.

Looking for the year, I scan through the text but don't see any specific year mentioned. So, I'll set it to "Not Listed".

For the `title`, it's clearly stated as "Investigating Health Care Providers: Data and Resources".

The `description` needs a concise summary. The tipsheet covers various resources for investigating healthcare providers like hospitals, nursing homes, etc., so I'll phrase that into a clear sentence.

Now, the `keywords`. I need up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords are "health care", "investigative journalism", "data resources", "hospitals", and "nursing homes".

I should make sure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes without any markdown formatting.

Putting it all together, I structure each key with its corresponding value, ensuring the JSON syntax is correct. I double-check that all required keys are present and that optional fields like `email` are set to null where necessary.

    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
