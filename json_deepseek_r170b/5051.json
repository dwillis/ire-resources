Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided a detailed outline with multiple sections about collaborating during reporting, sharing data, producing content, reconciling standards, coordinating distribution, and big picture considerations.

First, I should identify each key required for the JSON: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The id is given as 5051. Next, the authors are listed as Crina Boros, Sandhya Kambhampati, Jeff Kelly Lowenstein, and Ben Wieder. Since their emails and affiliations aren't provided, I'll set those to null.

The conference is clearly stated as an IRE event, so that's straightforward. The year isn't mentioned in the text, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

For the title, the main heading is "Collaborating with the Competition". 

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers collaboration strategies for journalists working together on projects, including communication, data sharing, content production, and distribution.

Now, keywords. From the sections, relevant terms are collaboration, journalism, investigative reporting, data sharing, and cross-border reporting. I'll limit it to these five, excluding the conference name and authors as instructed.

Putting it all together, each part should be enclosed in quotes and structured correctly without any markdown.
