Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, the ID is given as 4107, so that's straightforward. Next, the authors are Jon Keegan and Ken Schwencke. Their affiliations are The Wall Street Journal and The Los Angeles Times respectively, which I can extract from their introductions. Since there are no emails provided, those fields will be null.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE" since that's part of the user's context. The year isn't mentioned anywhere in the text, so it defaults to "Not Listed".

For the title, the main heading is "Intro to SDR (Software Defined Radio)", which seems appropriate. The description should summarize the tipsheet content. It's about building a police scanner using an RTL-SDR device and related software tools. So I'll condense that into one or two sentences.

Looking at keywords, they need to be no more than five terms. From the text, relevant terms include "Software Defined Radio (SDR)", "RTL-SDR", "police scanner", "ADS-B Aircraft data", and "AIS tracking". These cover the main topics discussed in the tipsheet.

I should ensure all keys are enclosed in quotes and values as well. Since there's no year listed, it remains as "Not Listed". Also, since authors' emails aren't provided, those fields stay null.

Putting it all together, I structure each key with its corresponding value, making sure everything is properly formatted in JSON.
