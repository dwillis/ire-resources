Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has provided specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, I'll identify the id which is given as 3137. That's straightforward.

Next, for authors, there's only one person listed: Corinna Zarek. Her email is czarek@rcfp.org and her affiliation is The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. So the authors array will have one object with name, email, and affiliation filled in.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE since it's part of the event title: 2008 IRE NATIONAL CONFERENCE.

The year is given as 2008, so that's easy to include.

For the title, the main heading seems to be "COURT ACCESS: FIGHTING FOR INFORMATION". That's clear and concise.

Now, the description needs to be a brief summary. The tipsheet talks about increasing secrecy in courts with issues like anonymous juries and sealed records. It also mentions resources from The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. So I'll craft a 1-2 sentence summary capturing that.

Keywords are next. They should be relevant and up to five terms. Looking at the content, "court access", "secrecy", "judicial transparency", "reporters rights", and "legal resources" seem appropriate. These exclude the conference name and author, as instructed.

I need to make sure all values are in English unless specified otherwise. Here, everything is in English, so that's fine.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each key accordingly, ensuring proper syntax with quotation marks around keys and string values.
