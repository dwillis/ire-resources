Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, looking at the input, the title mentions "Use Audio to Break Assumptions and Create Empathy" with speakers Kate Wells and Lindsey Smith from Michigan Radio/NPR. They discussed their podcast “Believed”. 

The id is given as 5911. For authors, I have two names: Kate Wells and Lindsey Smith. Their emails aren't provided, so they'll be null. The affiliation is Michigan Radio/NPR.

The conference is IRE since it's from an Investigative Reporters and Editors event. The year isn't explicitly stated but the speakers are 2019 Livingston Award winners, so I can infer the year as 2019.

The description needs to be a concise summary. It should mention how audio helps in investigative journalism by creating empathy and breaking assumptions, referencing their podcast on the criminal case.

Keywords should include terms like "audio journalism", "investigative reporting", "empathy", "narrative structure", and "sensitive sources". These are relevant without overlapping with conference or author names.

Putting it all together, I structure each key accordingly ensuring all values are in English and properly quoted.
