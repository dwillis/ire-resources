Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id is given as 3370, so that's straightforward.

Next, authors: The input mentions Robert Benincasa from NPR and Stephen Stock from CBS4 WFOR-TV Miami. Each author entry should have name, email, and affiliation. Emails are provided for both, so I'll include those. Affiliations are clearly stated, so I'll use them as is.

Conference: Since the text mentions it's from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE), the conference key should be "IRE".

Year: The input doesn't specify a year, so I'll set that to "Not Listed".

Title: The title provided in the example is "Useful Web Sites for Journalists". I'll stick with that.

Description: It needs to be a brief summary. The text lists various websites useful for journalists, so I can write something like, "A collection of useful web sites for journalists, including resources for investigations, public records, and data analysis."

Keywords: The user example uses ["Investigative journalism", "Web tools", "Public records", "Journalism resources"]. I'll keep those since they're relevant.

I need to ensure all keys are in quotes and the JSON is properly formatted. Also, make sure not to include any extra information beyond what's provided.
