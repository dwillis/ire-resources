Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) tipsheet. The user provided specific instructions on the structure and content.

First, I'll extract the necessary information from the input. The id is given as 5864. The author's name is Ellen Gabler. Since there's no email or affiliation mentioned, those fields will be null.

Next, the conference is clearly IRE. The year isn't provided in the text, so it defaults to "Not Listed". The title of the tipsheet is "Requesting records and data under open records law".

For the description, I need a concise summary. The main points are about effectively requesting specific documents and strategies to overcome obstacles. So, I'll phrase it as a 1-2 sentence overview.

Keywords should be up to five terms. Relevant ones from the content include "open records laws", "FOIA requests", "government transparency", "document requests", and "investigative reporting".

I need to ensure all keys are in quotes and values are correctly formatted. Since no year is mentioned, it stays as "Not Listed". I'll structure the JSON accordingly without any markdown.
