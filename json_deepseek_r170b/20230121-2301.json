Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Chris Bragg of The Buffalo News about speeding up FOIL requests in New York. Let me break down the requirements step by step.

First, the id should be 2301. That's straightforward.

Next, authors is a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. The input only mentions "Chris Bragg, The Buffalo News." So, I'll set his name as "Chris Bragg," email as null since it's not provided, and affiliation as "The Buffalo News."

For the conference, the options are IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed. Since the tipsheet doesn't specify which conference it's from, I'll go with "Not Listed." 

The year is also unclear, so that will be "Not Listed" as well.

The title should clearly reflect the tip. It mentions speeding up FOIL requests in New York, so the title would be something like "Tip on Speeding Up FOIL Requests in New York."

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The key point is using constructive denial appeals to expedite responses from agencies. I'll phrase it simply: "Learn how to use 'constructive denial' appeals under New York's FOIL law to speed up responses to records requests."

Keywords should include relevant terms without including the conference or authors. From the text, important keywords are FOIL requests, constructive denial, New York, public records, and open government.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part accordingly, ensuring all keys are in quotes and values match the specified requirements.
