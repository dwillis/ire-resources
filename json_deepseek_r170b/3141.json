Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through this step by step.

First, looking at the input, it's titled "International Networking" under "Investigative Reporting in Asia." The speaker is Sheila S. Coronel, who's the Director at Columbia University's Stabile Center for Investigative Journalism.

The description part needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary. The text talks about Asia's booming media market with countries like China and India leading in newspaper circulation despite global trends. It also mentions opportunities for investigative reporting across various media platforms and lists several examples of centers, websites, magazines, and programs involved in investigative journalism.

For the JSON keys: id is 3141 as specified. Authors should be a list. The speaker's name is Sheila S. Coronel; email and affiliation aren't provided, so they'll be null. Since she's from Columbia University, her affiliation is there.

Conference is "Not Listed" because it doesn't explicitly say IRE or NICAR. Year isn't mentioned, so also "Not Listed." Title is straightforward: "International Networking."

The description will summarize the media growth and investigative opportunities in Asia. Keywords should be no more than five terms related to the content: Investigative Reporting, Asia, Media, Journalism, Opportunities.

I need to make sure all values are in English and properly quoted. Let me structure this correctly.
