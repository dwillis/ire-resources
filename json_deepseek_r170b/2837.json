Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's input with specific keys. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id should be 2837, that's straightforward. Next, looking for authors. The text mentions "The Dallas Morning News" and "ProPublica" as news organizations, but there are no specific author names provided. So, I'll set each author's name to null, their email to null, and affiliation to the respective news organization.

Conference is either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". The text doesn't specify which conference it was presented at, so I'll go with "Not Listed".

The year isn't clearly mentioned either, so that will also be "Not Listed".

For the title, the user's example uses "Transportation Safety and Investigative Reporting Tips", which seems appropriate as a general title based on the content.

The description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary. The text provides tips and resources for reporters covering transportation safety, so I'll craft a concise summary around that.

Keywords should be up to five terms. From the content, "transportation safety", "investigative reporting", "FARS data", "crash analysis", and "journalism resources" seem relevant.

Putting it all together, ensuring each key is properly quoted and values are in English. I'll structure the JSON accordingly without making up any information that's not provided.

```json
{
  "id": 2837,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Dallas Morning News"
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "ProPublica"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Transportation Safety and Investigative Reporting Tips",
  "description": "This text provides tips and resources for reporters covering transportation safety, including the use of FARS data and crash analysis tools.",
  "keywords": [
    "transportation safety",
    "investigative reporting",
    "FARS data",
    "crash analysis",
    "journalism resources"
  ]
}
```
