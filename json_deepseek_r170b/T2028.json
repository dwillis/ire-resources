Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down each step.

First, the id is given as T2028, so that's straightforward.

Looking at the authors section: The presenter is Tom Witosky from the Des Moines Register. His email is twitosky@dmreg.com. I should list him with his name, email, and affiliation as "Des Moines Register." Since there are no other presenters mentioned, the authors list only includes Tom.

The conference is IRE because it's specified in the input. The year is 2004, clearly stated as CINCINNATI 2004.

For the title, the session is called "Sports and the Computer: All star teammates HEADFIRST CAR." I'll keep that exact wording but ensure it fits into a concise title format.

The description needs to be a brief summary. The tipsheet discusses using CAR (Computer-Assisted Reporting) in sports journalism through various databases like EADA reports, graduation rates, budgets, etc., to uncover deeper stories. So the description should capture that essence succinctly.

Keywords are next. I'll extract relevant terms: "CAR", "sports reporting", "databases", "EADA reports", and "graduation rates." These cover the main topics without including the conference or authors.

Putting it all together, each part is mapped to its respective key in JSON format. I have to ensure proper syntax with quotes and commas, and no markdown since the user requested just a JSON object.
