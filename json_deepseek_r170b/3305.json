Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from T. Christian Miller at the IRE 2009 conference. Let's break down each part step by step.

First, the id is given as 3305, so that's straightforward. Next, the authors section needs a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. The text mentions T. Christian Miller from ProPublica. Since there are no other authors listed, I'll include only him. His email isn't provided, so it remains null.

For the conference, since it's clearly stated as IRE 2009, that's set. The year is obviously 2009. The title of the tipsheet is "Writing the Investigative Story."

The description should be a concise summary. The main points are digitizing information for organization and using tools like Excel or OneNote. It also covers creating timelines, organizing quotes, and structuring the story. I'll condense that into one or two sentences.

Keywords need to be relevant and limited to five. From the content, "investigative reporting," "organization," "digitization," "timelines," and "storytelling" seem appropriate.

Putting it all together, each key is filled out with the extracted information, ensuring everything is in English and properly quoted.
