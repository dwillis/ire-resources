Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query and the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through this step by step.

First, the user specified that the response should be a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The ID is given as 5355, so I'll start there.

Looking at the tipsheet, I see three presenters: Alex Harwin, Jennifer LaFleur, and Kameel Stanley. Each has their name, email, and affiliation listed. So, for each author, I'll extract these details. If any information is missing, I'll set it to null, but in this case, all have emails and affiliations.

Next, the conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's straightforward. The year isn't explicitly mentioned, so I'll default to "Not Listed".

The title of the tipsheet is "Education Civil Rights Data: The good, the bad, the dirty", which I can use as is.

For the description, I need a concise summary in 1-2 sentences. The tipsheet discusses using federal and state data to uncover disparities in education civil rights, such as discipline practices affecting minority students. It also mentions the impact of their reporting on policy changes. So, my description will capture that essence succinctly.

Keywords are up to five terms. I'll choose "education", "civil rights", "data journalism", "school discipline", and "investigative reporting" since they encapsulate the main topics without including the conference or authors' names.

Putting it all together, each part of the JSON is filled out based on the extracted information from the tipsheet.
