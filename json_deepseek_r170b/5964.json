Okay, I'm trying to help this user create a JSON object based on their query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me break down what they need.

First, the user provided specific instructions, so I need to make sure I follow them closely. They want a response that's only a JSON object, nothing else. The structure includes id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

Looking at the content, the tipsheet is from IRE 2019, directed by Lois Norder, Mikel Schaefer, and Adam Playford. Their affiliations are given, so I'll include those as authors with their respective news organizations.

The id should be 5964 as specified. The title mentioned in the input is "Directing the high-stakes investigation." For the description, it needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about managing challenges like stressed reporters and scared sources, so I'll highlight that along with establishing expectations and processes.

Keywords are next. They should be no more than five terms excluding conference and authors. From the content, "high-stakes investigation," "project management," "reporter coaching," "source handling," and "editorial processes" seem relevant.

I need to ensure all values are in English unless specified otherwise. Since the original text is in English, that's straightforward. Also, make sure each key and value is enclosed in quotes as per JSON standards.

Double-checking for any missing info: The year is clearly IRE 2019, so the year field is set. All authors have affiliations listed, so their details are complete.

Putting it all together, I structure the JSON with each required key, ensuring proper formatting and that there are no markdown elements as per the user's request for only a JSON object.
