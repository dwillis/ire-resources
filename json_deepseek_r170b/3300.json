Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let's break down the requirements step by step.

First, the ID is given as 3300. That’s straightforward.

Next, authors. The document mentions Craig R. McCoy from The Philadelphia Inquirer. Since there's no other author listed, the authors array will have one element with his name and affiliation. Email isn't provided, so it'll be null.

Conference should be "IRE" because that's explicitly mentioned in the text.

The year is a bit tricky since the original text doesn’t specify when the conference took place. It mentions the new forms arriving starting November 2009, but without knowing the exact event date, I have to default to "Not Listed".

For the title, it should clearly state what the tipsheet covers. The main focus is on the revised IRS Form 990 for nonprofits, so I'll go with "Reporter’s fact sheet on new IRS nonprofit Form 990".

The description needs a concise summary. The key points are the major revision of Form 990 after 30 years, focusing on governance and disclosures about insiders. So, something like: "A guide to understanding the new IRS Form 990 requirements for nonprofits, including governance and insider dealings."

Keywords should be relevant and limited to five. Nonprofit governance, transparency, executive compensation, conflict of interest policies, and tax filings seem appropriate.

Putting it all together, I need to structure each part correctly, ensuring all fields are in quotes and the JSON is properly formatted.
