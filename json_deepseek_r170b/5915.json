Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. They provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference by Marilyn Thompson from ProPublica. 

First, I'll identify each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The ID is given as 5915, so that's straightforward. For the authors, there's only one person mentioned—Marilyn Thompson. Her email and affiliation are provided, so I'll include those in an object within the authors array.

Next, determining the conference. Since the tipsheet mentions it's from IRE conferences, the conference key will be "IRE". The year isn't specified in the text, so I'll set that to "Not Listed".

The title is clearly stated as "Pitching local project ideas: Five questions to ask". 

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet provides five questions for pitching local stories, focusing on relevance, reporter's expertise, pre-reporting, aligning with ProPublica’s mission, and adaptability. So the description will capture that in one or two sentences.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Relevant keywords here are "pitching", "local journalism", "project ideas", "journalism tips", and "ProPublica".

Putting it all together, I'll structure each key accordingly, ensuring all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes.
