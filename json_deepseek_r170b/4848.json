Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let's break down the user's requirements step by step.

First, the structure should include specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is given as 4848, so that's straightforward.

Looking at the content, Barbara Gray is listed as the author. Her affiliation is CUNY J-School. Thereâ€™s no email provided, so I'll leave that as null. Since only one author is mentioned, the authors list will have a single object with her details.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE JUNE 2016, so the conference key is "IRE" and the year is 2016.

The title of the tipsheet isn't explicitly given, but from the content, it's about research tools and techniques. So I'll name it "Research Tools and Techniques for Journalists."

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet covers various search methods, people finding resources, scholarly articles, and social media tools. I'll condense that into a 1-2 sentence overview.

Keywords should be no more than five, excluding conference and authors. Relevant terms here are "search techniques," "people finding," "scholarly research," "government reports," and "social media analysis."

I also need to ensure all keys and values are in English and enclosed in quotes. No markdown formatting, just plain JSON.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, making sure each field is correctly populated based on the provided information.
