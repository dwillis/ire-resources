Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let's break down what the user has given me.

First, looking at the content, there are several presenters mentioned: Chris Groskopf from Quartz, Ryann Jones from ProPublica, Stuart Thompson from WSJ, and Aaron Williams from The Washington Post. Their affiliations are clear next to their names along with their Twitter handles, but no emails provided. So for each author in the JSON, I'll list their name, set email as null since it's not given, and assign their affiliation based on the news organization they're from.

The conference seems to be NICAR because of the hashtag #nicarmethods used throughout the document. The year isn't explicitly mentioned, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

For the title, the main topic is about when and how data journalists disclose their methods. So a suitable title would be "When and How Data Journalists Disclose Their Methods". 

The description should be a concise summary of what the session covers. It discusses the balance between transparency in data analysis for public understanding without overwhelming readers with unnecessary complexity.

Looking at the keywords, terms like transparency, methodology disclosure, data journalism, complex analysis, and reader understanding are relevant. I'll make sure to limit them to five as per instructions.

I need to structure all this into a JSON object with the specified keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The ID is given as 4663. 

Let me double-check that I'm not including any made-up names and that affiliations are correctly assigned based on the text. Since emails aren't provided, they'll remain null.

Putting it all together, the JSON should accurately reflect the information from the tipsheet without adding or omitting any crucial details.
