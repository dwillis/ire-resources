Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given input. Let me start by carefully reading through the provided text.

The presentation is titled "Presentation as Storytelling Tool - NICAR14" from Speaker Deck. It was published on March 1, 2014, so the year should be 2014. The conference mentioned is NICAR14, which I know stands for the National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting conference. So, the conference key will be "NICAR".

Looking at the authors, there are three main speakers: Helene Sears from BBC Visual Journalism, Aron Pilhofer from The New York Times, and Alyson Hurt from NPR. Chrys Wu from The New York Times was the moderator. Since the prompt says not to make up any names, I'll list these four as authors.

For each author in the JSON, they have name, email, and affiliation. Emails aren't provided, so those will be null. Affiliations are clear from their titles: BBC Visual Journalism, The New York Times (twice), and NPR.

The description should be a 1-2 sentence summary. It talks about user-centric design for engaging the public with beautiful and informative stories, presented by these speakers at NICAR14.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the content, "user-centric design", "storytelling", "data visualization", "journalism", and "engagement" fit well.

Putting it all together, I structure each part step by step, ensuring all keys and values are in quotes as required.
