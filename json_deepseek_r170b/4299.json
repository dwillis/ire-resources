Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an IRE conference. Let me go through each key step by step.

First, the id should be 4299 as given. 

For authors, there are two reporters listed: Betsy McKay and Jennifer S. Forsyth. Betsy's email is provided, and her affiliation is the Wall Street Journal. Jennifer doesn't have an explicit affiliation mentioned next to her name, but since she's with the WSJ, I should use that as her affiliation too.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE Computer-Assisted Reporting Conference", so I'll abbreviate it to "IRE" in the JSON. The year is March 2015, so I'll write that as 2015.

The title of the tipsheet is "Tracking Diseases." 

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. It's about using data analysis and mapping to investigate disease outbreaks, especially focusing on funding and timelines during crises like Ebola. So I can phrase it as tracking diseases via data analysis and mapping for investigative reporting.

Keywords should include terms like "disease tracking," "data analysis," "funding," "mapping," and "Ebola." I'll limit it to five.

Putting it all together, I structure each part accordingly without adding any extra information. Make sure everything is in English and properly quoted.
