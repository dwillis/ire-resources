Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id should be 3110 as specified. That's straightforward.

Next are the authors. The text lists two people: Joshua Brown and Aaron Wische. Their emails are provided, joshb@ktvt.com and amwische@ktvt.com. Both work at KTVT-Dallas/Ft. Worth, so their affiliations should be that news organization.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE Miami 2008, so the conference key will be "IRE" and the year is 2008.

The title of the tipsheet is given as "Kicking up Your Production a Notch". 

For the description, I need to summarize the content. The tipsheet focuses on using Adobe Photoshop and After Effects for producing investigative reports with animations and effects like 3D layers and highlighting. It's about enhancing production value through these techniques.

Keywords should be no more than five terms excluding conference and authors. From the text, relevant keywords are "Adobe Photoshop", "After Effects", "animation", "document design", and "investigative reporting".

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with these values.

```json
{
  "id": 3110,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": "joshb@ktvt.com",
      "affiliation": "KTVT-Dallas/Ft. Worth"
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": "amwische@ktvt.com",
      "affiliation": "KTVT-Dallas/Ft. Worth"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2008,
  "title": "Kicking up Your Production a Notch",
  "description": "This tipsheet provides techniques for enhancing investigative reports using Adobe Photoshop and After Effects, focusing on document animation, highlighting effects, and 3D layering.",
  "keywords": [
    "Adobe Photoshop",
    "After Effects",
    "animation",
    "document design",
    "investigative reporting"
  ]
}
```
