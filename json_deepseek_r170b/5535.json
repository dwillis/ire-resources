Okay, so I need to help this user by creating a JSON object based on their query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. They provided specific instructions on how the JSON should look with certain keys like id, authors, conference, etc.

First, I'll start by identifying each key and what's required for it. The id is given as 5535, so that's straightforward. Next, the authors section is a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. In their example, Elizabeth Crisp is the only author listed with her email and affiliation from The Advocate.

The conference is specified as "IRE" since it's related to IRE conferences. The year isn't provided in the query, so according to instructions, I should set it to "Not Listed". The title seems clear: "Tips for covering the State Capitol".

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary of 1-2 sentences. Looking at their content, it's about strategies and tips for journalists reporting on state capitols. So my description will reflect that.

For keywords, I need up to five relevant terms excluding conference names or authors. The topics covered include Capitol coverage, government transparency, data management, legislative reporting, and investigative journalism. These seem appropriate.

I should ensure all values are in English as per the instructions, and make sure everything is properly enclosed in quotes with correct syntax. No markdown, just a plain JSON object.
