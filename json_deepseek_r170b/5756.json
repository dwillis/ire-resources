Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this user's query. They want me to create a JSON object based on a specific set of instructions from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The example they provided uses id 5756 with certain fields like authors, conference, year, etc.

First, I need to parse the input text correctly. It's about teaching oneself to code, presented by Scott Pham and C.J. Sinner at NICAR 2019. The user has specific keys they want in the JSON: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

Looking at the instructions, I should set the id to 5756. For authors, each should have name, email, and affiliation. Since emails aren't provided, they'll be null. Affiliations are the news organizations mentioned, so Scott is with BuzzFeed News and C.J. with Star Tribune.

The conference is NICAR, year is 2019, title seems to be "How to Teach Yourself to Code." The description needs a concise summaryâ€”maybe about overcoming challenges in learning code for journalism. Keywords could include coding, self-learning, journalism tools, etc., but limited to five.

I should make sure all values are in English and enclosed in quotes. Also, avoid making up any info; if it's not there, leave it as null or omit. Double-checking the example provided by the user to ensure consistency in structure.
