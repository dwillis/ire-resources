Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, the id is set to 3788 as per the instruction. Next, for authors, there are three names mentioned: Kimbriell Kelly, Jarrett Murphy, and Patricia Wen. Their affiliations are listed next to their names in the tipsheet, so I can include those. Emails aren't provided, so they'll be null.

The conference is clearly an IRE event since it's from Investigative Reporters and Editors. The year isn't mentioned anywhere in the text, so I'll set that to "Not Listed".

For the title, the main heading says "INVESTIGATING POVERTY" followed by a subtitle, which I can combine into one string.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about how to cover poverty by using data and selling stories to editors and audiences. So I'll summarize that in two sentences.

Keywords should include relevant terms without repeating the conference or authors. From the content, "poverty", "investigative reporting", "data journalism", "editorial pitching", and "public policy" seem appropriate.

I need to ensure all keys are in quotes and values are properly formatted. No markdown, just plain JSON.
