Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on some input with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is fixed as 2852. 

First, for the authors, each should have name, email, and affiliation. If there's no name listed, it stays null. Emails and affiliations can be null too, but if a news organization is mentioned, that becomes the affiliation unless specified otherwise.

Next, the conference must be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". I'll have to determine which one applies here. The year needs to be extracted; if it's not clear, mark it as "Not Listed".

The title should be a concise summary of the text. The description is a 1-2 sentence simple summary. Keywords are up to five terms, excluding conference and authors' names.

I also need to ensure all values are in English unless the original isn't, and everything must be enclosed in quotes.

Wait, but looking back at the input provided, it's about parsing addresses from Oklahoma City building permits. Hmm, that doesn't seem to match creating a JSON object for a conference or academic paper. Maybe I misread the task.

Let me check again: The user wants a JSON object with specific keys related to a conference or event. So perhaps the original input was more about an event description rather than addresses. But in the provided context, it's about addresses and building permits.

This is confusing. Maybe there was a mix-up. I'll need clarification on what exactly to base the JSON on. Since the user mentioned creating a JSON object with those keys, but the example given is about parsing addresses, perhaps they meant to provide different input. 

If I proceed, I should probably use placeholder data or indicate that more information is needed. But since the user wants this based on their input, which seems to be about addresses, maybe the JSON should relate to that? Or perhaps it's a separate task.

I'm a bit stuck here because the instructions don't align with the provided context. I'll need to ask for more details or clarify whether the JSON is related to parsing addresses or if there's another input intended.

To accurately create the desired JSON object, I would need the specific event or conference details rather than the address data. If you provide the relevant information about the event, including authors, conference name, year, and a description, I can then structure it into the correct JSON format with the specified keys.

If you meant to use the provided addresses as input, please clarify how they should be transformed into the JSON object's fields. Once I have the correct context or additional details, I'll be happy to assist further!
