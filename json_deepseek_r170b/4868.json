Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let's see what information I have here.

First, the speaker is David Armstrong from The Georgia News Lab at Georgia State University. His email is david.armstrong@georgianewslab.org, and his Twitter handle is @GeorgiaNewsLab. The title of the tipsheet is about doing controversial investigations from university-based outlets.

Looking at the structure I need to follow: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The id should be 4868 as per the example. For authors, it's a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. Since only David Armstrong is listed, his details go here. The conference is clearly IRE. The year is mentioned in the filename as 2016, so that's set.

The title is given as "Tips for Doing 'Controversial' Investigations from University Based Outlets." For the description, it should be a concise summary. Maybe something like: "Advice on conducting controversial investigations while working under a university affiliation."

Keywords are up to five terms, excluding conference and authors. From the content, I can extract terms like "investigative journalism," "university-based reporting," "controversial stories," "risk management," and "collaboration." That should cover it.

I also need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. No markdown, just plain JSON. So putting it all together without any mistakes.
