Alright, I'm trying to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conferences. The user wants specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, I'll look for the ID. It's given as 3938, so that's straightforward.

Next, the authors section needs to be a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. Lewis Kamb is listed, along with his email and affiliation from The News Tribune. There are no other authors mentioned, so I'll only include him.

For the conference key, since this tipsheet is about an IRE event, it should be "IRE".

The year isn't explicitly stated in the provided text. Without that info, I'll set it to "Not Listed".

The title of the tipsheet is clearly "Investigating Immigration Detention".

Now, the description needs a concise summary. The series examined detention centers, their expansion, and related issues. So, I'll craft a 1-2 sentence summary highlighting these aspects.

Keywords should be relevant and up to five terms. From the content, immigration detention, Northwest Detention Center, ICE contracts, investigative journalism, and Secure Communities are key topics. These will make good keywords.

Putting it all together, I ensure all values are in English, enclosed in quotes, and properly formatted as a JSON object.
