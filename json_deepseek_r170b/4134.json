Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, the user specified that the id should be 4134. So I'll start with "id": 4134.

Next, looking at the authors section. The speaker is Ellen Gabler from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Her email and Twitter handle are provided, so I can include those. The structure for each author in the list requires name, email, and affiliation. Since her affiliation is clearly stated as Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, that's straightforward.

Now, the conference key. The tipsheet is about open records law, which is a common topic at IRE conferences. Unless specified otherwise, it's safe to assume this was from an IRE event, so "conference": "IRE".

For the year, the provided text doesn't mention the specific year of the conference. Therefore, according to the instructions, I'll set "year": "Not Listed".

The title should be a concise description of the session. The tipsheet is about requesting records and data under open records law, so I'll use that as the title.

Moving on to the description. It needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. The tipsheet provides strategies for journalists to obtain public records, so I'll craft a brief summary capturing that essence.

Keywords are next. They should be relevant and no more than five terms. From the content, keywords like "FOIA", "public records", "investigative reporting", "open records law", and "data journalism" seem appropriate.

I need to make sure all values are in English unless otherwise specified, which they are here. Each key and value must be enclosed in quotes as per JSON standards.

Putting it all together, I structure the JSON with each key, ensuring correct syntax and proper data types. For instance, authors is an array of objects, each containing name, email, and affiliation.

Finally, I'll review to ensure no made-up names are used, only actual information provided in the tipsheet is included. Everything seems to fit, so the JSON should be correctly formatted.
