Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has provided specific instructions, so I should make sure to follow them closely.

First, I'll identify each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The id is straightforward; it's 4139 as given.

Next, for the authors, there's Ken Armstrong listed with his email and affiliation. Since the text mentions The Seattle Times, that will be his affiliation. So, the authors array should have one object with name "Ken Armstrong", email "karmstrong@seattletimes.com", and affiliation "The Seattle Times".

Conference is either IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed. The tipsheet is from an IRE conference, so that's set.

Year isn't provided in the text, so it defaults to "Not Listed".

Title is clearly "Chasing Paper (And electronic records – and audio and video and …)" as given.

Description needs a 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet focuses on strategies for obtaining public records beyond initial requests, emphasizing relationships with officers and considering alternative agencies. So, the description should capture that essence concisely.

Keywords are up to five terms, excluding conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords include "public records", "FOIA", "investigative journalism", "transparent government", and "journalism tips".

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part correctly, ensuring proper use of quotes and commas in JSON format without markdown.
