Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given query and the input text provided. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the user's instructions, they want a JSON response with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. Each of these has certain requirements.

Starting with the "id" field. The user specified that it should be "T20". Thatâ€™s straightforward.

Next is "authors", which needs to be a list containing elements with name, email, and affiliation. From the input text, I see Steve Stecklow's details: his name, email, and he works for the Wall Street Journal. His partner, Alix Freedman, is mentioned but without her contact info or affiliation, so her email and affiliation will be null.

The "conference" key should be one of "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Since the input text refers to an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference, I'll set it to "IRE".

For "year", since the input doesn't specify a particular year for the conference, it defaults to "Not Listed".

The "title" is straightforward: "Investigating UN".

Now, the description needs to be a concise 1-2 sentence summary. The text discusses Steve Stecklow and Alix Freedman's investigative work on the UN, so I'll summarize that.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords would be "UN", "investigation", "Pulitzer Prize", "UNICEF", and "HIV". 

Putting it all together, I need to structure this into a JSON object with each key properly enclosed in quotes, ensuring correct syntax without any markdown formatting as per the user's request.

```json

  "id": "T20",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Steve Stecklow",
      "email": "steve.stecklow@wsj.com",
      "affiliation": "Wall Street Journal"
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigating UN",
  "description": "Steve Stecklow and Alix Freedman share tips for investigating the United Nations, including sources like former employees and U.N. missions.",
  "keywords": [
    "UN",
    "investigation",
    "Pulitzer Prize",
    "UNICEF",
    "HIV"
  ]
}
```
