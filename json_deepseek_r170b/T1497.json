Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on the structure, so I should follow those closely.

First, looking at the input, it's about a presentation titled "Using Business Information Online Resources in Researching Enron" presented by Richard Drezen at the NICAR Conference in Philadelphia in 2002. So the id is T1497 as per the example.

Next, under authors, there's only one author mentioned: Richard Drezen. His email is drezenr@washpost.com and his affiliation is The Washington Post. I need to structure this as an array with one object containing name, email, and affiliation.

The conference is clearly stated as NICAR, so that goes into the conference key. The year is 2002 since the presentation was on March 15, 2002.

For the title, it's exactly as given: "Using Business Information Online Resources in Researching Enron".

The description needs to be a concise summary. The presentation discusses using online resources to research Enron, highlighting both fee-based and free sources. So I'll write that it focuses on utilizing various online business information tools for investigative research into Enron.

Keywords should include terms like "Enron", "business research", "online resources", "SEC filings", and "bankruptcy court documents". These are the main points discussed in the tipsheet, so they make sense as keywords.

I'll structure all this into a JSON object with the specified keys. Making sure everything is properly quoted and formatted. I need to ensure that all values are correct and there are no typos.

Also, since the year is clearly provided, it's 2002, not "Not Listed". The conference is NICAR, so that's straightforward.

I should double-check each part: id, authors array with name, email, affiliation; conference, year, title, description as a short summary, and keywords up to five relevant terms.

Once everything looks good, I can finalize the JSON object.
