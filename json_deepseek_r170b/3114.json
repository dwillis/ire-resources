Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an IRE conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, I'll start with the id. The user specified that it should be 3114, so that's straightforward.

Next, the authors section. There are two speakers listed: Rose Ciotta and Mary Shanklin. For each, I need to extract their name, email, and affiliation. 

Rose Ciotta is the Education Editor at The Philadelphia Inquirer, and her email is rciotta@phillynews.com. So her details are clear.

Mary Shanklin is an Investigative Reporter at The Orlando Sentinel, with the email MShanklin@orlandosentinel.com. Her phone number is provided, but since it's not needed for the JSON, I can ignore that.

The conference is explicitly stated as IRE in Miami, June 5, 2008, so the conference key will be "IRE" and the year is 2008.

For the title, the main heading seems to be about using data and documents to investigate schools. So a suitable title would be "Using Data and Documents to Investigate Schools".

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet lists various data points and documents for investigating schools, so I can write that it provides resources for journalists to hold the education system accountable.

Keywords should include the main topics: charter schools, test scores, superintendent contracts, school foundations, and payroll records. These are all key areas covered in the document.

I'll structure each part carefully, ensuring no markdown is used and everything is enclosed in quotes as per JSON standards.
