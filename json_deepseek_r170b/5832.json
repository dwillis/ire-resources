Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has specified certain keys and requirements for each part of the JSON.

First, I'll identify the id as 5832 since that's given. Next, looking at the authors section, there's only one author mentioned: Ronald Campbell from NBC Owned Television Stations with his email provided. So, the authors list will have one object containing his name, email, and affiliation.

The conference is clearly stated as NICAR Conference in Newport Beach, CA on March 9, 2019, so I'll set the conference key to "NICAR" and the year to 2019. 

For the title, it's "Life After FactFinder: Inside data.census.gov". The description needs to be a concise summary of the tipsheet. I'll mention the transition from American FactFinder to data.census.gov, highlighting features like search functionality, profiles with statistics, and advanced search capabilities.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Relevant keywords here are "American FactFinder", "data.census.gov", "Census Bureau", "data tools", and "research methods".

I'll structure all these elements into a JSON object, ensuring that each key is enclosed in quotes and the values follow the specified formats.
