Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each requirement step by step.

First, the user provided a detailed text with strategies for setting up data teams in developing countries. The task is to structure this into a specific JSON format with keys like id, authors, conference, year, etc.

Starting with the id: it's given as 5006, so that's straightforward.

Next, authors. The tipsheet includes several examples from different news organizations like IndiaSpend, Nation Newsplex in Kenya, Pajhwok News Agency, and InfoTimes. However, none of these mention specific author names. So according to the instructions, I should leave the name as null for each author entry. Their affiliations can be the respective news organizations they're associated with.

For the conference key, since the text mentions "Investigative Reporters and Editors conferences," it clearly points to "IRE".

The year isn't specified in the provided text, so I'll set it to "Not Listed".

The title is given at the top: "Big data in small organizations: Strategies from setting up data teams in developing countries."

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about strategies for using big data in smaller organizations, especially in developing countries, so I'll craft a 1-2 sentence summary reflecting that.

Keywords should be relevant and limited to five. Looking at the content, terms like "data journalism," "small news organizations," "developing countries," "data teams," and "strategies" are appropriate.

Putting it all together, I structure each part into the JSON format as specified.

    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "InfoTimes"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Big data in small organizations: Strategies from setting up data teams in developing countries",
  "description": "This tipsheet provides strategies for implementing data journalism in small news organizations, particularly in developing countries.",
  "keywords": [
