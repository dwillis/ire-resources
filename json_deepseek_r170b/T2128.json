Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's instructions. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the ID is given as T2128, so that's straightforward. Next, looking at the authors section. The text mentions Sarah Cohen from The Washington Post with her email cohensh@washpost.com. There are no other authors listed, so I'll only include her in the list. Her name isn't null because it's provided, and the affiliation is clearly The Washington Post.

Now, the conference isn't explicitly mentioned in the text. It just says "from Investigative Reporters and Editors conferences," but without specifying which one (like IRE or NICAR). So I'll set conference to "Not Listed".

The year is also not provided anywhere in the input. There's no date or year mentioned, so I have to leave that as "Not Listed" too.

For the title, it's "Drilling for Oil in Teams". That makes sense since the tipsheet is about working together on investigative projects using database techniques.

The description needs to be a concise summary of 1-2 sentences. The main idea is how project teams can effectively work together by breaking their efforts into four phases: exploration, sampling, drilling, and refining. So I'll write that it outlines strategies for collaboration between reporters and data specialists in investigative projects.

Keywords are next. They should be no more than five terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking at the text, important keywords would be "investigative journalism", "collaboration", "database reporting", "project management", and "teamwork". These capture the essence of the tipsheet without overlapping with author names or conferences.

Putting it all together, each part should be in English as per instructions. I'll structure the JSON accordingly, making sure each key is enclosed in quotes and the authors are a list with their details.
