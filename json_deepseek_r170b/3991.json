Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on this tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conferences. The user has given specific instructions, so I should make sure to follow each step carefully.

First, the structure requires an id, which is already provided as 3991. That’s straightforward. Next are the authors. Looking at the text, there's only one author mentioned: Jaimi Dowdell from IRE. Since the user instructed not to make up names and to leave them null if none are listed, but here we have a name, so that should be included. Email and affiliation can be null since they aren't provided. So authors will be a list with one object containing name: "Jaimi Dowdell", email: null, affiliation: "IRE".

The conference is IRE because the tipsheet is from an IRE event. The year isn’t mentioned in the text, so according to instructions, it should be "Not Listed". 

For the title, looking at the content, it seems to cover various U.S. data sources that are useful internationally. So a suitable title would be something like "U.S. Data Sources for International Investigations".

The description needs to be a concise 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. The tipsheet provides multiple resources from different agencies like Federal Contracts, US AID loans, FDA import refusals, etc. So the description could summarize that it's a collection of U.S. government data sources useful for international reporting.

Keywords should be no more than five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords would include "Federal Contracts", "International Reporting", "FDA Import Refusals", "US AID", "Data Sources". I think those cover the main topics without overlapping with each other too much.

Putting it all together, ensuring that each key is properly formatted with quotes and values in English. Also, making sure that there are no markdown elements as per the user's request.
