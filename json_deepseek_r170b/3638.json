Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Rob O’Dell at Arizona Daily Star. Let me break down the requirements step by step.

First, the structure should include id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is given as 3638. 

Looking at the authors section: it's a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. From the text, Rob O’Dell is listed with Arizona Daily Star, so his entry will have name as "Rob O’Dell", affiliation as "Arizona Daily Star", and email as null since it's not provided.

The conference is IRE because the tipsheet is from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) event. The year isn't explicitly mentioned, so I'll set that to "Not Listed".

For the title, the main focus of the tipsheet seems to be using data in breaking news and real estate stories, so something like "Using Data in Breaking News and Real Estate Investigations" fits.

The description needs a concise summary. Rob's work involved using data to uncover how banks were buying tax liens and foreclosing homes, so I'll phrase it to reflect that process and findings.

Keywords should be relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. So, "data journalism", "real estate", "foreclosures", "tax liens", and "investigative reporting" are appropriate.

Putting it all together, I structure each part carefully to ensure compliance with the given instructions.

  "conference": "IRE",
