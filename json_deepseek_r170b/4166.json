Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through the user's instructions step by step.

First, the id is specified as 4166. That’s straightforward.

Next, authors should be a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. The text mentions Kurtis Ming from KOVR-TV (CBS) Sacramento. So, his name is Kurtis Ming, email isn’t provided, and affiliation is KOVR-TV (CBS) Sacramento. There are no other authors mentioned, so the list has only one entry.

The conference is IRE since it's clearly stated as IRE 2014 San Francisco. The year is 2014 because that’s part of the event name.

For the title, the text starts with "Consumer News Tipsheet," which makes sense as the main topic.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers strategies for impactful consumer reporting, including verification, documentation, and visual elements like graphics and sound effects. So I can summarize that in one or two sentences.

Keywords should include relevant terms without repeating the conference name or authors. Looking through the content, "consumer reporting," "investigative journalism," "storytelling techniques," "viewer engagement," and "media production" are all key points mentioned. That’s five keywords as instructed.

I need to ensure all keys and values are in English and enclosed in quotes. No markdown is allowed, so just plain JSON with proper formatting.

Putting it all together, I structure each part carefully, making sure not to include any extra information beyond what's provided and keeping the description clear and brief.
