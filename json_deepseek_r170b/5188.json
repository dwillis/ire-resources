Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's input about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The user provided some notes from Emilia Díaz-Struck of ICIJ regarding collaboration in journalism.

First, looking at the structure: id is 5188 as specified. Authors are mentioned; there's only one author, Emilia Díaz-Struck. Her email and affiliation aren't provided, so they'll be null. The conference is IRE because that's where this tipsheet was presented. Year isn't listed in the input, so it's "Not Listed". 

Title should be the main topic, which seems to be about collaboration at ICIJ. Description needs a concise summary—maybe about the collaborative approach and tools used.

Keywords are next: collaboration, journalism, IRE, investigative reporting, team work. Wait, no more than five terms, so let me pick the most relevant ones without including the conference name or author.

Putting it all together: id, authors with their details, conference, year, title, description, keywords. Making sure everything is in English and properly quoted.

    {

    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "ICIJ’s radical sharing kitchen",
  "description": "This tipsheet discusses how the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) facilitates collaboration among journalists across different countries and media organizations.",
  "keywords": [
