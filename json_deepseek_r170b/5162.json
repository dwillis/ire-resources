Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. First, I'll go through each part of their instructions step by step.

The user provided specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. They want the id to be 5162. Since there are no authors listed in the input, I should set "authors" as an empty array.

Next, determining the conference. The tipsheet mentions IRE multiple times, so it's safe to classify the conference as "IRE". The year isn't specified anywhere in the text, so I'll set that to "Not Listed".

For the title, looking at the content, it focuses on engaging audiences and using Facebook Live for investigations. So a fitting title would be "Engaging Audiences Through Facebook Live and Authentic Storytelling".

The description needs to be a concise summary. The main points are engaging viewers by being authentic and using live interactions as part of investigative journalism. I'll phrase that into a clear sentence.

Keywords should capture the essence without including the conference or authors. Terms like "audience engagement", "Facebook Live", "authentic storytelling", "investigative journalism", and "social media" fit well, making sure they're within five items.

I also need to ensure all keys are in quotes and values are properly formatted. No made-up names for authors since none were provided. The final JSON should encapsulate all these elements accurately.

  "id": 5162,
  "authors": [],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Engaging Audiences Through Facebook Live and Authentic Storytelling",
  "description": "Tipsheet focusing on audience engagement strategies, including the use of Facebook Live for investigative reporting and the importance of authenticity in storytelling.",
  "keywords": [
    "audience engagement",
    "Facebook Live",
    "authentic storytelling",
