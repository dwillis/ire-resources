Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has provided specific instructions, so I should follow them carefully.

First, the id is fixed at 5242. Got that. Next, authors: there's only one author mentioned, Deb Nelson. Her affiliation is Philip Merrill College of Journalism, University of Maryland. No email is listed, so that will be null. 

The conference is clearly IRE since it was presented at the IRE 2017 Annual Conference. The year is 2017 as stated in the text.

For the title, the tipsheet doesn't have a specific title beyond the four tips, but looking at the content, it's about building curriculum and best practices for teaching investigative journalism. So I'll title it something like "Building Curriculum and Best Practices for Teaching Investigative Journalism."

The description needs to be a concise summary. It should mention that the tipsheet provides advice on creating a strong curriculum, collaborating with other classes, choosing feasible projects, and the importance of footnoting sources.

Keywords are up to five terms. The main points are curriculum development, collaboration, project management, investigative journalism education, and academic partnerships. That covers the key aspects without overlapping with the conference or authors.

I should ensure all values are in English and correctly formatted within quotes. No markdown, just plain JSON.
