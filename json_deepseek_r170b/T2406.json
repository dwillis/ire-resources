Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from the IRE Annual Conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id should be T2406 as specified. 

Looking at the authors section, there's only one author mentioned: Peter Panepento from the Erie Times-News. His email and phone number are provided. Since the affiliation isn't explicitly stated next to his name, I'll use the news organization as his affiliation.

The conference is clearly the IRE Annual Conference, so that's straightforward. The year isn't directly given in the text, so I'll set it to "Not Listed".

For the title, the session is titled “Investigating property scams”. 

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet discusses various documents and tactics used to uncover property scams, including public records and unusual sources. So I'll write that it's about investigative techniques for uncovering such scams.

Keywords should include relevant terms like "property scams", "public records", "mortgage records", "financial disclosure", and "corporate records". These are all central themes in the text.

I need to make sure all keys and values are enclosed in quotes. I'll structure it with each key properly, ensuring that authors is a list containing Peter's details as an object within the array.
