Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The query provides detailed information from Christina Jewett of Kaiser Health News, focusing on getting past press releases in health journalism.

First, I'll identify each required field:

1. **id**: Given as 5617.
2. **authors**: There's one author mentioned, Christina Jewett. Her email and affiliation are provided, so both can be filled in. No need to make up any names since it's clearly listed.
3. **conference**: It's an IRE event, so the conference field is "IRE".
4. **year**: The year isn't specified in the text, so I'll set it to "Not Listed".
5. **title**: The title provided is "Getting past the press releases on the health beat".
6. **description**: Needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet offers various investigative techniques like using facility inspection reports and legal documents.
7. **keywords**: Extract relevant terms from the contentâ€”health journalism, facility inspections, investigative reporting.

I need to ensure all keys are in quotes and that the JSON structure is correct without any markdown. Double-checking each field for accuracy, especially making sure no information is fabricated or assumed beyond what's provided.
