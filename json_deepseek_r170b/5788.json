Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. Let me go through this step by step.

First, looking at the input, there are several projects mentioned with descriptions, URLs, and authors like MaryJo, Todd, Dana, etc., each associated with news organizations. The user wants the id as 5788, so I'll set that first.

Next, for the authors section, I need to list each author with their name, email, and affiliation. Since none of the text provides emails or affiliations explicitly linked to the authors, I'll leave those as null. But since the projects are from news organizations like Star Tribune, Boston Globe, Dallas Morning News, and USA Today, I can use these as affiliations for each author respectively.

Now, the conference key needs to be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". The user provided examples from different conferences, so without specific info, I'll default this to "Not Listed".

The year is tricky. The input doesn't specify when these projects were presented, so I have to set it as "Not Listed" as well.

For the title, since the main topic revolves around data journalism lessons learned from various projects, I can generalize it as such.

The description needs a concise summary. I'll mention that it's about data journalism projects and their challenges, focusing on examples like sexual assault reporting and diversity analysis.

Keywords should be no more than five terms. I'll extract relevant ones: "data journalism", "investigative reporting", "sexual assault", "diversity", and "education".

Putting it all together, ensuring each key is properly enclosed in quotes and values are correctly formatted.
