Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given input. Let's break down what needs to be done step by step.

First, identify each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The id is straightforward; it's given as 4421.

Next, authors. From the text, I see "Sarah Bryner" listed with her email and affiliation as The Center For Responsive Politics. So the authors list will have one object with name: "Sarah Bryner", email: "sbryner@crp.org", and affiliation: "The Center For Responsive Politics".

Conference is next. Looking at the text, it's from a CAR conference in 2015. Since CAR stands for Computer-Assisted Reporting, which is part of IRE (Investigative Reporters and Editors), the conference should be listed as "IRE".

Year is clearly 2015 based on the input.

Title is given as "So they bought a federal candidate, now what?".

For the description, it needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers tracking political contributions using resources like OpenSecrets.org and FEC data. So the description should mention these elements briefly.

Keywords should be no more than five terms. Relevant ones are campaign finance, political contributions, OpenSecrets.org, FEC, and lobbying data.

Now, putting it all together in JSON format with proper syntax.

```json
{
  "id": 4421,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Sarah Bryner",
      "email": "sbryner@crp.org",
      "affiliation": "The Center For Responsive Politics"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2015,
  "title": "So they bought a federal candidate, now what?",
  "description": "This tipsheet provides resources and methods for tracking political contributions and campaign finance data using OpenSecrets.org and FEC data.",
  "keywords": [
    "campaign finance",
    "political contributions",
    "OpenSecrets.org",
    "FEC",
    "lobbying data"
  ]
}
```
