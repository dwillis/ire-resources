Alright, I need to help the user create a JSON object from their input based on specific instructions. Let me go through this step by step.

First, they provided a lot of text that seems to be from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. My task is to extract relevant information and structure it into a JSON format with the keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The user specified that the 'id' should be 5795, so I'll set that as given. 

Next, looking at the input, there are several names mentioned like Shawn McIntosh from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and Doug Haddix from IRE/NICAR. These will go into the 'authors' list. Each author object needs a name, email, and affiliation. Since emails aren't provided, those will be null. Affiliations should come from the text next to their names if available.

The conference is either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". The input mentions NICAR 2019 in Newport Beach, so I'll set 'conference' as "NICAR" and 'year' as 2019 since it's clearly stated.

For the title, the main header seems to be about a CAR (Computer-Assisted Reporting) conference. So I'll use something like "CAR Conference Highlights".

The description needs to be a concise summary. The text includes mentions of various speakers, topics like FOIA, cross-border reporting, and tools like spreadsheets in journalism. I'll condense this into 1-2 sentences.

Keywords should be up to five terms, excluding the conference and authors. Terms like "FOIA", "data journalism", "cross-border reporting" are relevant here.

I also need to ensure all values are in English and enclosed in quotes unless specified otherwise. 

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part carefully, making sure not to invent any information and leaving null where data isn't available.
