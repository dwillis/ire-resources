Alright, so I'm trying to create this JSON object based on the given tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE). Let me go through it step by step.

First, the id is straightforward—it's 3488 as specified. Next, looking at authors, the tipsheet doesn't list any names, emails, or affiliations. So I'll set each of those to null because there's no information provided.

The conference is either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Since this is from IRE, that's clear. The year in the document is 2011, so that goes into the year field without any issues.

For the title, it just says "Tipsheet #3488" at the top, so that will be the title. Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The content seems to be about duplication being prohibited without permission from IRE, Inc., and there's nothing else in the text. So the description should reflect that.

Keywords are next. Since the main topic is about duplication rights and permissions, those would be appropriate keywords. They’re relevant but not too broad or specific.

Putting it all together, I structure each key with the appropriate values, making sure everything is enclosed in quotes as required. That should cover all the necessary parts without adding any made-up information.

```json
{
  "id": "3488",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2011",
  "title": "Tipsheet #3488",
  "description": "A tipsheet from the Investigative Reporters and Editors conference discussing duplication rights.",
  "keywords": ["duplication", "rights", "permissions"]
}
```
