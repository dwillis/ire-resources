Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has provided specific instructions on what each key should contain. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the keys required are id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. 

Starting with "id": The example uses "api". I think that's just a placeholder, so I'll keep it as "api" since there's no specific ID given in the text.

Next, "authors": There are three speakers listed—Daniel Lathrop from The Dallas Morning News, Jacob Harris from The New York Times, and Alasdair Dant from The Guardian. Each author should have a name, email, and affiliation. In the provided text, emails aren't listed, so those will be null. Affiliations are the news organizations they work for, which are given next to their names.

"conference": Since the tipsheet mentions NICAR12 in the query example, it's safe to assume this is a NICAR conference. So I'll set that as "NICAR".

"year": The text doesn't specify the year of the event, so according to instructions, it should be "Not Listed".

"title": The title given is 'Scrape Twitter or Die Tryin’'.

"description": It needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. The tipsheet talks about scraping Twitter for journalism using tools like DataSift and code snippets, so I'll mention that.

"keywords": Up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Relevant keywords here are "Twitter", "data scraping", "journalism tools", "DataSift", and "TweeSV.rb".

Now, putting it all together, making sure each part is correctly formatted as per JSON standards with proper quotemarks and structure.

    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Scrape Twitter or Die Tryin’",
  "description": "Learn how to scrape Twitter data for investigative journalism using tools like DataSift and custom Ruby scripts.",
  "keywords": ["Twitter", "data scraping", "journalism tools", "DataSift", "TweeSV.rb"]
}
```
