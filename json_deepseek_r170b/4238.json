Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let's break down what needs to be done step by step.

First, looking at the input provided, it starts with two names: Mary Jo Webster and Jodi Upton. They're the authors of this tipsheet. I need to create an authors array where each author has a name, email, and affiliation. The instructions say not to make up any names, so since there are no emails or affiliations listed, those will be null.

Next, the conference is clearly identified as IRE because of the link "IRE14-60ideasdemo" which likely stands for the 2014 IRE conference. So the conference key should be "IRE".

The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the input, so according to the instructions, it'll be "Not Listed". 

The title is straightforward: "60 data-driven ideas in 60 minutes". That's a clear and concise title given at the top.

For the description, I need to summarize the content in 1-2 sentences. The tipsheet lists 60 different story ideas categorized under topics like Government watchdog, Public safety, Inspections, etc. So the summary should mention that it provides numerous data-driven investigative story ideas across various topics important for journalists.

Keywords are next. They should be a list of no more than five terms, excluding the conference and authors. Looking at the categories in the tipsheet, the prominent ones are Government watchdog, Public safety, Inspections, Business oversight, and Data journalism. These capture the essence without being too specific or too broad.

Putting it all together, I structure each part into the JSON format with appropriate keys: id (given as 4238), authors (each as objects with name, email, affiliation), conference, year, title, description, keywords.

I also need to ensure that all values are in English and enclosed in quotes. No markdown or additional formatting should be present. Just a clean JSON object that accurately reflects the provided tipsheet information.

    },
    {
      "name": "Jodi Upton",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
