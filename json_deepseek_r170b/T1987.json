Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an IRE conference. Let's break down what each part of the query is asking for.

First, the id should be T1987 as specified. Next, authors are listed with their name, email, and affiliation. The text mentions Jaimi Dowdell with her email and she's affiliated with both IRE and NICAR, so that goes into the authors array.

The conference is explicitly stated as Cincinnati 2004, which was organized by IRE and NICAR. So the conference field will be "IRE" since that's one of the allowed values. The year is clearly 2004 from the text.

For the title, it's given at the top: "Networks for the Newsroom" followed by a subtitle, so combining those makes sense. 

The description needs to be a concise summary in simple terms. I'll focus on how social network analysis can aid reporters in understanding connections and power structures within communities.

Keywords should be relevant and no more than five. The text discusses social networks, investigative reporting, public records, relationships, and connectionsâ€”these seem appropriate.

I need to ensure all fields are enclosed in quotes and the structure is correct without any markdown formatting.
