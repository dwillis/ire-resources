Okay, I need to figure out how to create a JSON object based on the user's query. The user provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference about using data and voters' voices to show who would be affected by changes in voter access.

First, I'll start by identifying each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. 

The id is given as 6075. That's straightforward.

Next, the authors section should be a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. However, in the provided text, there are no specific authors listed. So each author entry will have null for name, email, and affiliation.

Conference is specified as "IRE" since it's from an IRE conference. 

The year isn't mentioned in the text, so it should be "Not Listed".

For the title, the tipsheet's title is clear: "Using data and voters’ voices to show who would be affected by changes in voter access."

The description needs to be a concise 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet helps reporters find and use election data effectively, so I'll phrase it accordingly.

Keywords are up to five terms. I'll extract relevant ones like "election data," "voter access," "election administration," "polling places," and "voter turnout."

Putting it all together, each part is mapped correctly without any made-up information.

```json

  "id": 6075,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Using data and voters’ voices to show who would be affected by changes in voter access",
  "description": "This tipsheet provides guidance on accessing and analyzing election data to understand the impact of voter access changes. It includes sources for voter files, election administration data, and polling place information.",
  "keywords": [
    "election data",
    "voter access",
    "election administration",
    "polling places",
    "voter turnout"
  ]
}
```
