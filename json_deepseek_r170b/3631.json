Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's instructions. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the id is given as 3631, so that's straightforward.

Next, authors are listed as David Herzog from Missouri School of Journalism and NICAR. The user mentioned that email and affiliation can be null if not provided. Since there's no email for David, I'll leave it null. His affiliation is clearly Missouri School of Journalism, and NICAR is the conference, so that part is covered.

The conference is NICAR, as indicated in the text.

The year isn't explicitly mentioned, but looking at the examples, like "A roof over our heads" and other stories, I'm not sure about the exact year. So, I'll put it as "Not Listed".

For the title, the main heading is "Mapping the news", so that's clear.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about using GIS for data journalism, listing tools and resources. So I can summarize it as how mapping extends CAR, helps in storytelling, etc.

Keywords should be no more than five. From the content, terms like GIS, data journalism, geocoding, spatial analysis, and mapping make sense. I'll list those.

I need to ensure all keys are enclosed in quotes and values too. Also, since it's a JSON object, proper formatting with commas and brackets is crucial.

Double-checking each field: id, authors array with name, email, affiliation. Conference, year, title, description, keywords. Everything seems covered.
