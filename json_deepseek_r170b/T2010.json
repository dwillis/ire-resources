Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The input provides details about international data access, authored by Nils Mulvad.

First, I'll assign the id as "T2010" since it's specified. 

Next, for the authors array, there's only one author mentioned: Nils Mulvad. His email is provided, and his affiliation is the Danish Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting (Dicar). So, each field will be filled accordingly.

The conference isn't explicitly stated in the text, but given the context and the mention of IRE, I'll set it to "IRE".

Looking at the year, it's not clearly mentioned in the provided text. Therefore, the year should be "Not Listed".

For the title, the main topic is about working with international data, so a suitable title would be "Working with International Data".

The description needs to be a concise summary of 1-2 sentences. The tipsheet discusses methods for accessing data internationally and lists various sources, so I'll reflect that.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Relevant terms here are international data, data access, FOIA (Freedom of Information Act), and open data.

Putting it all together, each key in the JSON will have its corresponding value, ensuring all are enclosed in quotes.
