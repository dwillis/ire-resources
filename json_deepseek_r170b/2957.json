Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down what's required.

First, the id is given as 2957. Then, I have to list the authors with their details: name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the text, there are three speakers mentionedâ€”Jim Steele, Joe Stephens, and Mike McGraw. Each has an email provided, but only Jim's affiliation is clear from his email (Vanity Fair). For Joe and Mike, I'll use their respective news organizations as affiliations since they're part of the email addresses.

Next, the conference is clearly stated as IRE in Phoenix, Arizona, 2007, so the year is 2007. The title of the session is "Unsung Documents: Little Known or Hidden Files." 

For the description, it needs to be a concise summary. The main idea is about using obscure documents for investigative journalism by combining them with other sources and interviews. So I'll craft a sentence that captures this essence.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords include "investigative journalism," "documents," "FOIA," "public records," and "research techniques."

Putting it all together, each section is filled out accurately based on the provided information without making anything up.
