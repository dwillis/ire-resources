Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with certain keys.

First, let me parse through the input to extract all necessary information. The title of the tipsheet is "Mining Census For Non-Census Stories" presented by Ramona Smith at the NICAR National Conference in Philadelphia during 2002.

I notice that there are multiple authors mentioned with their emails and affiliations. I'll list each author as an object within the authors array, ensuring to include name, email, and affiliation where available. Some entries only have a name without contact details, so those will be null.

The description should be concise, summarizing how journalists use census data for broader stories beyond just population counts. I'll keep it to one or two sentences in simple language.

For the keywords, I need to identify relevant terms that capture the essence of the tipsheet without including the conference name or author names. Terms like "census data," "investigative reporting," "demographic analysis," and others seem appropriate.

The conference is clearly stated as NICAR National Conference, so that's straightforward. The year is 2002, which is also specified. 

I'll structure all this into the JSON format with proper syntax, ensuring that each key is enclosed in quotes and the values are correctly formatted as per the instructions.
