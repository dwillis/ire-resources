Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The user provided specific instructions, so I'll go through each step carefully.

First, looking at the query content, it's titled "Investigating Breaking News" from an IRE conference. There are no authors mentioned, so I'll set the authors list to null.

Next, the conference is clearly stated as IRE, and since there's no specific year provided in the text, I'll note that as "Not Listed".

For the title, it's straightforward: "Investigating Breaking News". 

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet offers strategies for using online resources and databases to support investigative journalism, especially in breaking news scenarios.

Keywords are crucial here. I should pick up to five relevant terms without including the conference name or authors. From the content, keywords like "investigative journalism", "breaking news", "online resources", "databases", and "research strategies" fit well.

Putting it all together, I structure each key as per the user's instructions, ensuring that all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes.
