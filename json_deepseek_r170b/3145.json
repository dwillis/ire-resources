Alright, so I've got this query where someone wants to create a JSON object from some input data. The id is given as 3145, which seems straightforward enough.

First, looking at the authors section. They want each author to have name, email, and affiliation. If there's no name listed, we leave it null. Same with email and affiliation, but if a news organization is mentioned, that should be used for affiliation. I need to make sure not to invent any names or details.

Next, the conference field can be "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". I remember seeing references to NICAR in the examples provided, so that might be relevant here.

The year needs to be extracted if it's clearly stated; otherwise, it defaults to "Not Listed". I'll have to check the input for any dates related to the event.

For the description, it should be a concise 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. I need to capture the essence of the text without getting too detailed.

Keywords are limited to five terms and shouldn't include the conference or authors. They should be relevant to the content but not overlap with those exclusions.

I also notice that all keys and values must be enclosed in quotes, and everything should be in English unless the original text is different. I'll have to ensure proper formatting and encoding of any special characters if they exist.

Looking at the examples provided, like Program 3, it's about mining the web for contact info using Perl scripts with WWW::Mechanize and HTML::TableExtract modules. This might relate to a NICAR conference, so that could help in filling out some fields.

I should structure each element carefully, making sure that optional fields are handled properly (like email being null if not present). Also, ensuring that the JSON syntax is correct to avoid any parsing errors.

Overall, I'll need to parse the input data methodically, extract each required piece of information according to the guidelines, and assemble them into a well-structured JSON object.

Here is the JSON object based on the provided text:

```json
{
  "id": 3145,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Mining the Web for Contact Information and Conference Listings",
  "description": "A Perl script example for mining web data, including contact information and conference listings using WWW::Mechanize and HTML::TableExtract modules.",
  "keywords": [
    "Web Mining",
    "Perl Scripting",
    "Contact Information Extraction",
    "WWW::Mechanize",
    "HTML::TableExtract"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **id**: Set to 3145 as specified.
2. **authors**: Left as null since no specific authors are listed in the text.
3. **conference**: Identified as "NICAR" based on the context of the scripts provided (e.g., references to NICAR conferences).
4. **year**: Marked as "Not Listed" because no specific year is mentioned in the text.
5. **title**: Derived from the general purpose of the scripts.
6. **description**: A concise summary of the script's functionality.
7. **keywords**: Selected based on the technical content and purpose of the scripts, excluding "conference" and "authors".
