Okay, I need to help the user by creating a JSON object based on their detailed query. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, the main goal is to structure the provided tipsheet into a specific JSON format with keys like id, authors, conference, etc. The input includes various resources related to electronic voting issues, so I'll need to extract relevant information from there.

Starting with the "id", it should be T2139 as specified. Next, for "authors", the user wants a list of objects each containing name, email, and affiliation. However, in the provided text, there are no explicit authors mentioned. So, all author fields will have null values except maybe affiliations if any news organizations are listed. But looking through the resources, I don't see specific authors, so authors will remain with nulls.

The "conference" key should be set to "Not Listed" since there's no indication which conference this tipsheet is from. The year is also unclear, so that field will be "Not Listed" as well.

For the title, it's provided in the input: "Getting started on electronic voting issues". That makes it straightforward.

The description needs to be a concise summary of one or two sentences. I'll paraphrase the main purpose, mentioning resources and issues related to e-voting.

Keywords are next. They should be no more than five terms excluding conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords would include "electronic voting", "voting systems", "election integrity", "legislation", and "voting technology".

I also need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes without any markdown.

So, putting it all together, I'll structure each key with appropriate values based on the provided information, making sure to follow all the user's instructions precisely.

  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Getting started on electronic voting issues",
  "description": "A tipsheet providing resources and information on electronic voting issues, including organizations, documented problems, and proposed legislative fixes.",
  "keywords": [
    "electronic voting",
    "voting systems",
    "election integrity",
    "legislation",
    "voting technology"
  ]
