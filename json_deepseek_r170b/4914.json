Alright, so I need to create a JSON object from the given input. The user has specified several keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. Let me go through each step.

First, the id is straightforwardâ€”it's 4914 as per the instructions.

Next, the authors section. Looking at the input, I see Michael Hudson listed with his email and affiliation as International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. There are other names mentioned like Kelly Carr and Kristian Petersen from The New York Times, but they don't have emails or affiliations explicitly stated next to their names. Since the instructions say not to make up names and to leave name null if none is listed, I should include only Michael Hudson because others don't have enough info.

For conference, the input doesn't specify where this was presented. The user mentioned possible values as "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Since it's not clear, I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

The year is also unclear from the context provided. So, I'll set that to "Not Listed" as well.

The title should be a concise representation of the content. The input seems to focus on investigative techniques for uncovering hidden assets and offshore accounts, so I'll go with that as the title.

Description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. I'll mention the key points about layering, nominee directors, beneficial owners, and how these structures obscure ownership.

For keywords, I need up to five terms excluding the conference or authors. Relevant terms here would be "offshore accounts", "hidden assets", "investigative techniques", "nominee directors", and "beneficial owners".

Putting it all together, I structure each part ensuring that all keys are enclosed in quotes and values are correctly formatted.
