Alright, I need to create a JSON object from the given tipsheet by Bill Dedman. Let's go through each requirement step by step.

First, the id should be 4584. That's straightforward.

Next, authors. There's only one author mentioned: Bill Dedman. His email is provided as bill@powerreporting.com and his affiliation is Newsday. So the authors array will have one object with these details.

The conference isn't explicitly stated in the text, but since it's from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE), I'll put "IRE" as the conference.

Looking for the year, the text doesn't mention a specific year, so I'll set it to "Not Listed".

For the title, the tipsheet is titled "Writing memorable investigative stories (even with data)", which I'll use exactly as is.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet offers advice on crafting memorable investigative pieces using data, covering field reporting, handling rebuttals, and effective storytelling techniques. So I'll phrase that into two clear sentences.

Keywords should be up to five terms. From the content, key topics include investigative journalism, data journalism, storytelling, field reporting, and rebuttals. These will make good keywords.

I need to ensure all keys are in quotes and values are correctly formatted. No markdown, just plain JSON.
