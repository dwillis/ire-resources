Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an IRE conference. Let me read through the user's query carefully.

First, the id is set to 5183 as specified. The title of the tipsheet is "Sexual Violence on Campus: The Records and Resources Available". 

Looking at the authors, Dan Bauman is listed with his email and affiliation from The Chronicle of Higher Education. There's no other author mentioned, so the authors list will have only one entry.

The conference is IRE 2017, so the year should be 2017. The description needs to be a concise summary. I'll mention tracking sexual violence investigations and the resources available for journalists.

For keywords, I need up to five relevant terms. Sexual violence, OCR investigations, Title IX, Clery data, and FERPA make sense here as they are key topics covered.

I must ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, avoid making up any information not provided.
