Okay, so I have this query where the user wants me to produce a JSON object based on some specific instructions. Let me read through it carefully.

They provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference, presented by Ellen Gabler from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. The tipsheet is all about using narrative writing in investigative journalism. There are several points like building suspense, gathering detailed information, being descriptive without being flowery, showing up in person, squeezing details from sources, staying organized, disciplined writing, and not being afraid of editing.

The user wants me to create a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is 4961. For the authors array, each entry should have name, email, and affiliation. If there's no author listed, leave name as null. Email and affiliation can be null too. Affiliation should come from the text if a news organization is mentioned.

Looking at the tipsheet, Ellen Gabler is the author, affiliated with Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. There's no email provided, so that will be null. Conference is IRE since it's from an IRE conference. The year isn't listed, so it'll be "Not Listed". 

The title should be "Use narrative writing to wind readers through your story." The description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. So something like emphasizing the importance of storytelling techniques with details and examples.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference and authors, so I'll pick narrative journalism, investigative reporting, storytelling, suspenseful writing, detailed reporting.

I need to structure all this into a JSON object with proper syntax and ensure all keys and values are in English. Let me make sure no markdown is used and it's properly formatted.
