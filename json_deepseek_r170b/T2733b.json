Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query and the provided tipsheet from Matthew Waite at the IRE 2006 Ft. Worth conference.

First, I'll extract the necessary information step by step.

The id is given as T2733b, so that's straightforward.

Next, looking for authors. The main author mentioned is Matthew Waite from the St. Petersburg Times. His email isn't provided in the text, so it will be null. There are no other authors listed, so the authors array has only one entry.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE 2006 Ft. Worth, so the conference key will be "IRE" and the year is 2006.

For the title, the tipsheet is about digging into environmental data, so a suitable title would be "Digging Into Environmental Data."

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet discusses using various data sources like permits and satellite imagery for investigative reporting on environmental issues. So, the description will reflect that.

Keywords should include relevant terms from the content: environment, data journalism, permits, satellite imagery, and investigative reporting.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with these elements, ensuring each key is properly quoted and values are correctly formatted.
