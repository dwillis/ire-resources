Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given input. The user provided a detailed tip sheet for journalists covering Iraq-related topics. They want me to structure this into specific fields: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, the id is 3119 as specified. Next, looking at the authors section. The text mentions T. Christian Miller from ProPublica, so I'll include him with his affiliation. There's no other author mentioned, so that's straightforward.

For the conference, since it's about investigative journalism and not explicitly stated as NICAR or another event, I'll mark it as "Not Listed". The year isn't provided in the text, so I'll also set that to "Not Listed".

The title should be concise. The main focus is on reporting in Iraq, so I'll use "Iraq Reporting Tips and Resources".

Now, the description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary. It's about tips for journalists covering Iraq, including resources like websites and embedding with the military.

Keywords are next. Important terms here would be "journalism", "Iraq", "investigative reporting", "military embeds", and "government contracts". I'll cap it at five as instructed.

Putting it all together, ensuring each key is in quotes and proper formatting. Making sure not to include any extra information beyond what's necessary.
