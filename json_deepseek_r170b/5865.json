Okay, so I need to create a JSON object from Miranda Spivack's Open Records Tip Sheet presented at the IRE2019 conference. The user provided specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, the id is given as 5865. Got that down. Next, authors is a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. From the text, Miranda Spivack is mentioned multiple times, and her email is included: mirandaspivack@yahoo.com. She's an independent journalist, so I'll note that under affiliation.

Then, conference is definitely IRE since it's part of the title (IRE2019). The year is 2019, clear from the same source.

The title should be exactly as given: "Miranda Spivack Open Records Tip Sheet-IRE2019". For description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet offers guidance on filing public records requests effectively, so that's what I'll write in simple terms.

Keywords are up to five, excluding the conference and authors. So, looking at the content: "public records", "FOIA", "open government", "investigative journalism". That's four, which is within the limit.

I have to make sure all keys are enclosed in quotes, values too, and structure it properly without any markdown. Let me piece this together step by step.
