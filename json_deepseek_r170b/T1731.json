Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each requirement step by step.

First, the id is specified as T1731, which I'll include as a string. Next, authors are listed in an array. Each author should have name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the input, Alison Young is the only person mentioned with her contact info: young@freepress.com and she's affiliated with Detroit Free Press. So, her entry will have all fields filled. Since there are no other authors mentioned, I'll just include her.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that goes in the conference key. The year isn't provided in the input, so it defaults to "Not Listed". 

For the title, it's given as "Managing and Juggling: Working with editors to get time for enterprise". That seems straightforward.

The description needs to be a concise summary of 1-2 sentences. The tipsheet talks about strategies for reporters to manage their time effectively while working on enterprise stories, so I'll phrase that simply.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. The content covers project management, journalism best practices, enterprise reporting, editor collaboration, and time management. These seem relevant and fit within the limit.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Each key and string value will have double quotes around them. I'll structure it without any markdown since the final output should be just the JSON.

Putting it all together, I think that's how the JSON should look. Let me make sure there are no typos and that each field is correctly formatted.
