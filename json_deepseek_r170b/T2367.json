Okay, so I'm trying to create this JSON object from the input provided. Let's see what information I have here.

First off, the id needs to be T2367. That part seems straightforward. Next, the authors section is a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. The instruction says not to make up any names and leave them as null if none are listed. It also mentions that if there's a news organization mentioned, use that as the affiliation.

Looking at the input text, I don't see any specific authors or their details mentioned. It just has a lot of content about various Excel topics, but no names or affiliations are listed. So for each author entry, name, email, and affiliation will all be null.

The conference key should be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". I don't see any indication of which conference this is from in the text. It just talks about Excel training topics without mentioning an event name or conference details. So, I'll set conference to "Not Listed".

For the year, if it's not clearly identified, we use "Not Listed" as well. The input doesn't specify a year, so that will be "Not Listed".

The description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. The text is about an Excel training handout covering various topics like data handling, formatting, and troubleshooting. So, I can write something concise about that.

Keywords are up to five terms, excluding conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords would include "Excel", "data analysis", "journalism", "troubleshooting", and "formatting". These capture the main topics covered without being too specific.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with these values. Each key needs to be in quotes, and the whole thing should follow proper JSON syntax.

```json
{
  "id": "T2367",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "An Excel training handout covering various topics such as data handling, formatting, and troubleshooting. It provides resources and tips for journalists using Excel.",
  "keywords": [
    "Excel",
    "data analysis",
    "journalism",
    "troubleshooting",
    "formatting"
  ]
}
```
