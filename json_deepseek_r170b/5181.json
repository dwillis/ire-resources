Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided query and the user's instructions. Let me break down what needs to be done step by step.

First, looking at the user's input, it seems they've provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The main speaker mentioned is Lisa Song from ProPublica. Her contact information includes her email and phone number. 

The id should be 5181 as specified. For authors, I need to list each one with their name, email, and affiliation. In this case, only Lisa Song is clearly listed. Since she's affiliated with ProPublica, that will be her affiliation. The other potential authors mentioned in the resources or examples don't have clear names provided, so they should be excluded.

Next, determining the conference: since it's from an IRE tipsheet, the conference key should be "IRE". The year isn't explicitly mentioned, so it'll default to "Not Listed".

The title of the tipsheet is about handling uncertainty in environmental reporting. The description needs to be a concise summary. Looking at the content, it focuses on assessing safety, comparing pollution levels across states, and resources for journalists.

Keywords should be relevant and limited to five. From the text, "environmental health", "pollution standards", "investigative journalism", "uncertainty in reporting", and "regulatory comparisons" seem appropriate.

I'll structure all this into a JSON object with the specified keys, ensuring each value is properly quoted and formatted.
