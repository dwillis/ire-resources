Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. The user provided detailed information about accessing Amazon's IRS Form 990 public data from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference.

First, I'll note that the id is given as 5484. The authors section should list each presenter with their name, email, and affiliation. From the input, Michele Tranquilli is listed with her email and affiliation to the Philadelphia Inquirer. There's also a mention of tipsheets from Andrea Fuller and Todd Wallack, but since they aren't the primary presenters here, I might not include them unless instructed otherwise.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE". The year isn't directly provided in the text, so I'll set it to "Not Listed". 

For the title, the main topic is about accessing IRS 990 data using XML tools. So, a suitable title would be "Accessing Amazon's IRS Form 990 Public Data".

The description needs to be concise, summarizing the content. The key points are the provision of tools and tips for working with IRS data, including specifics like handling different form types (990, 990EZ, 990PF) and additional resources.

Keywords should include terms relevant to the topic without mentioning the conference or authors. I'll list "IRS Form 990", "nonprofit data", "XML", "data journalism", and "Exempt Organizations Business Master File Extract" as they capture the essence of the content.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes, with each key following the specified structure.
