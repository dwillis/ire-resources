Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. The input provided seems to be from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet about public information access issues in Texas.

First, the id is given as 5584. Got that down. Now, for authors, I notice there are contacts listed: Kelley Shannon with email and affiliation FOI Foundation of Texas. So, her name will be included with those details. The other contacts like Telephone and Connect info don't have names attached, so they can't be added as separate authors.

The conference is mentioned in the original query as being from IRE conferences, so that's set to "IRE". The year isn't explicitly stated, so it'll be "Not Listed".

The title should capture the main topic. Looking at the content, four issues affecting public information access are discussed, so I'll name it "Four Issues Affecting Access to Public Information in Texas".

For the description, I need a concise summary. It's about challenges in accessing info related to government contracts, nonprofits, personal data, and private devices.

Keywords should include terms like transparency, public records, etc., without repeating the conference or authors. So I'll pick relevant terms from the content.

Putting it all together, the JSON structure will have id, authors (with Kelley Shannon's details), conference as "IRE", year as not listed, a brief title and description, followed by five keywords.
