Okay, so I need to help create a JSON object based on the user's query. Let me start by understanding what they're asking for. The input provided seems to be from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet titled "Build Your Beat: Tips on Sourcing and Interviewing" held at Texas State University in 2019.

First, I should identify the key elements required for the JSON object: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is given as 5588, so that's straightforward. 

Looking at the authors section, it seems there might be an author named Kimbriell Kelly with contact information provided (email and phone number). Her affiliation isn't explicitly mentioned, but since she's speaking at an IRE event, I can infer her affiliation is likely with a news organization like The Washington Post, as indicated by her email domain. However, if the text doesnâ€™t specify, maybe it's better to list the affiliation as null unless stated otherwise.

The conference is clearly IRE because the tipsheet mentions IRE in its content, so that key is set to "IRE". The year is 2019 since the date of the event is February 9, 2019. 

For the title, it should be exactly as given: "Build Your Beat: Tips on Sourcing and Interviewing".

The description needs to be a concise summary in simple language. The tipsheet covers sourcing strategies like using Google Advanced Search and LinkedIn, and interviewing techniques such as active listening and recording methods. So the summary could mention these aspects briefly.

Keywords should include terms related to journalism practices without including the conference name or authors. Possible keywords are "sourcing", "interviewing", "journalism", "investigative reporting".

I need to make sure all values are in English and enclosed in quotes. Also, since there's only one author mentioned, I'll structure the authors array accordingly.

Putting it all together, I should format this information into a JSON object with each key properly assigned.

```json
{
  "id": 5588,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2019,
  "title": "Build Your Beat: Tips on Sourcing and Interviewing",
  "description": "A tipsheet from the IRE conference covering strategies for sourcing and interviewing, including Google Advanced Search, LinkedIn, footnotes, recommendations, and social media.",
  "keywords": [
    "sourcing",
    "interviewing",
    "journalism",
    "investigative reporting"
  ]
}
```
