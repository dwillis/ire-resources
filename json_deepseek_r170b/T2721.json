Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from James Neff's presentation at the IRE conference. Let me break down what each part requires.

First, the id is given as T2721. That's straightforward. Next, authors should be a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. From the text, the author is James Neff, his email is jneff@seattletimes.com, and his affiliation is The Seattle Times. So I'll include that.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE National Conference in Ft. Worth, Texas. The year is 2006 since it's mentioned as June 15-18, 2006. The title of the tipsheet is "CRAFTING THE INVESTIGATIVE NARRATIVE".

For the description, I need a concise summary. It should mention that Neff provided rules and suggestions for writing investigative narratives, covering elements like plot, character development, and structure.

Keywords are next. They shouldn't include the conference or authors, so I'll pick relevant terms from the content: narrative journalism, investigative reporting techniques, storytelling in journalism, serial narrative structure, and plot development in journalism.

I need to make sure all keys and values are in English and enclosed in quotes. No markdown, just a clean JSON object.
