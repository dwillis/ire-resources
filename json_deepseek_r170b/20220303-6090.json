Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about transforming federal court accessibility and transparency from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with certain keys like id, authors, conference, etc.

First, let me parse through the input. The session was held on a Thursday at 10:45 AM ET, but I don't see a year mentioned, so I'll note that as "Not Listed". The title is clear: "Transforming the accessibility and transparency of federal courts".

Next, for the authors (or panelists), there are three people mentioned. Joe Germuska is the moderator from Northwestern University Knight Lab, Charlotte Alexander from Georgia State University, and Michael Lissner from Free Law Project. Each has their name, email, and affiliation. I'll list them as an array under "authors" with these details.

The description should be a concise summary of the session. It's about making federal court data more accessible and introducing tools like those from Knight Lab and Free Law Project. I'll keep it to one or two sentences.

Conference is NICAR, which stands for the National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting, so that goes under "conference". 

Keywords should include terms relevant to the topic without including the conference or authors' names. So, "federal courts", "transparency", "data accessibility", "judicial data tools", and "court records" seem appropriate.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly quoted. Also, since the year isn't specified, it remains as "Not Listed".

Finally, I'll structure this into a JSON object with the specified keys and correct formatting.
