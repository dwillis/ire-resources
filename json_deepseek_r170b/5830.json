Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's instructions. The input provided is about a session from the NICAR Conference discussing the transition from American FactFinder to data.census.gov. 

First, the id is given as 5830, so that's straightforward.

Next, authors: Tyson Weister is listed with his email and affiliation as U.S. Census Bureau. Ron Campbell and Angeliki Kastanis are mentioned as co-panelists but without emails or affiliations, so their entries will have nulls for those fields.

Conference is NICAR since the input mentions it's from the NICAR Conference in Newport Beach.

Year is 2019, clearly stated in the session intro.

Title should be "Life After FactFinder: The Future of data.census.gov".

Description needs to be a concise summary. I'll focus on the transition and the new platform's features.

Keywords are up to five terms. I'll choose "Census Bureau", "data.census.gov", "American FactFinder", "data accessibility", and "API access" as they capture the main points.

Now, putting it all together in JSON format with proper structure and ensuring all keys are in quotes.
