Alright, so I need to create a JSON object from the provided tipsheet. Let me first understand what each part of the query requires.

The user wants a response that's only a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is given as 4220. 

Looking at the input, Jennifer Levitz from the Wall Street Journal is mentioned as the author. Her email isn't provided, so I'll set it to null. The affiliation will be "Wall Street Journal" since that's her employer.

The conference isn't explicitly stated here, but looking through the text, there are mentions like Society for Gynecologic Oncologist and other medical terms, which don't point to IRE or NICAR. So the conference is "Not Listed".

The year isn't clearly mentioned either, so it'll also be "Not Listed".

For the title, the tipsheet's heading is "This Won’t Hurt a Bit: Tips for researching origins of a medical device". That works.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The main idea seems to be about investigating the risks and oversights in medical devices, especially morcellation. I'll phrase it as a 1-2 sentence summary focusing on that.

Keywords should be no more than five terms. Relevant ones here are "medical device", "morcellation", "cancer risk", "SEC filings", and "patent analysis".

Putting it all together, I structure the JSON with these elements. Making sure all keys and values are in quotes and proper format.
