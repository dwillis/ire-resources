Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Mark Hunter's presentation at the Global Journalism Conference in Copenhagen, 2003. Let me go through each key step by step.

First, the id should be "T589" as specified. Next, authors is a list where each entry has name, email, and affiliation. The text mentions Mark Hunter, so I'll set his name, but since there's no email or affiliation provided, those will be null. 

Conference is either IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed. Since the event is the Global Journalism Conference, it doesn't fit the first two options, so conference will be "Not Listed". The year is 2003 because that's when the conference took place.

For the title, looking at the content, it seems to focus on investigative techniques for finding sources and tracking down information. So I'll name it "Investigative Techniques for Tracking Sources".

The description needs a concise summary. The main idea is using public records and building trust with sources in criminal investigations. So something like: "Tipsheet from Mark Hunter on using public records, building source trust, and conducting deep research in criminal investigations."

Keywords should be up to five terms related to the content but not including the conference or authors. The text talks about public records, building trust, criminal investigations, source tracking, and investigative techniques.

Putting it all together, I structure each part accordingly, ensuring all keys are correctly formatted as strings with quotes.

  "id": "T589",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Mark Hunter",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "2003",
  "title": "Investigative Techniques for Tracking Sources",
  "description": "Tipsheet from Mark Hunter on using public records, building source trust, and conducting deep research in criminal investigations.",
  "keywords": ["public records", "source tracking", "criminal investigations", "investigative techniques"]
}
```
