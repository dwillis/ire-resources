Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conferences. The user has provided specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with particular keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, the id should be "demo_1" as specified. Looking at the content, there are two tools discussed: TimeFlow and The Video Notebook. Since the main focus seems to be on The Video Notebook, I'll center the JSON around that.

Next, for authors, I need a list of objects each with name, email, and affiliation. Scanning through the text, Charlie Szymanski and Tyler Dukes are mentioned with their emails. Their affiliations aren't explicitly stated next to their names, but since they're part of the Reporters' Lab at Duke University, I'll use that as their affiliation.

The conference is IRE, so that's straightforward. The year isn't provided in the text, so it should be "Not Listed". 

For the title, I'll go with "The Video Notebook" as it's a significant tool discussed. The description needs to be a concise summary of what the tool does. It helps journalists organize and analyze video content by syncing notes, tweets, etc., so I'll phrase that into a 1-2 sentence summary.

Keywords should be up to five relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. From the text, "video analysis", "journalism tools", "data organization", "open-source software", and "reporting technology" seem appropriate.

I also need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes without any markdown formatting.
