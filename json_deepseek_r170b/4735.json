Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has specified several requirements that I need to follow closely.

First, the id is given as 4735. I should ensure this is correctly assigned in the JSON.

Next, I have to extract authors with their name, email, and affiliation. Looking through the data, there are four individuals mentioned: Joe Wertz from StateImpact Oklahoma, Mike Corey from CIR/Reveal, Kavya Sukumar from VOX Product, and Nancy Watzman from Television Archive. Their emails are also provided as @joewertz, @mikejcorey, @KavyaSukumar, and @nwatzman respectively.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's straightforward. The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the text, so it should be "Not Listed".

For the title, the tipsheet starts with "Data = Damn-Good Audiovisual Journalism," which seems appropriate to use as the main title.

The description needs to be a concise summary of 1-2 sentences. I'll focus on how data can enhance storytelling in audio and video by converting it into sound or visuals, mentioning specific tools like Miditime for audio and Chitram for videos.

Keywords should be up to five terms. From the content, relevant keywords include "data journalism," "audiovisual storytelling," "Miditime," "Chitram," and " investigative reporting."

I must ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. I'll structure each key accordingly without making any assumptions beyond what's provided.

Finally, I'll double-check that the JSON syntax is correct to avoid errors.
