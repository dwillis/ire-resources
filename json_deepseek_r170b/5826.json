Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. Let me first understand what they're asking for. The user provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors conference titled "Hunting Bears (and Pandas, Spiders, Jackals, Tigers & more…)" by Rob Barry from The Wall Street Journal.

The JSON should have specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 5826. For the authors, I need a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. Since only Rob Barry is mentioned with his affiliation as The Wall Street Journal, that's straightforward.

The conference is either IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed. Looking at the URL provided in the tipsheet (bit.ly/nicar19-bears), it seems to be from NICAR 2019, so the year should be 2019.

Next, the title is clear: "Hunting Bears (and Pandas, Spiders, Jackals, Tigers & more…)". The description needs to be a concise summary. From the content, it's about investigating cyberattacks and using tools like Passive DNS and WHOIS. So I'll summarize that into one or two sentences.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Relevant keywords here are cybersecurity, cyberattacks, investigative journalism, Russia, and intelligence.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly quoted. Let me structure this correctly without any markdown.
