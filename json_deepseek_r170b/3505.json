Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let's break down each required key step by step.

First, the id is provided as 3505, so that's straightforward.

Next, authors. The tipsheet lists Brian Haas from The Tennessean with his contact info. So I'll create an object for him with name, email, and affiliation. No other authors are mentioned, so the list has only one entry.

For conference, since it mentions IRE National Conference 2011, that's clear. So conference is "IRE".

The year is explicitly given as 2011 in the header, so that goes into the year field.

Title should be the session title, which is "Smart Drug Coverage: From Cartels to Pill Mills". That makes sense.

Description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about covering drug trafficking and designer drugs, resources for tracking trends, so I'll phrase it as a 1-2 sentence overview of that.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference and authors. The main topics here are illicit drugs, synthetic drugs, search warrants, Mexican cartels, and poison control centers. These capture the essential elements without overlap.

Now, putting all together in JSON structure with proper syntax and ensuring all keys are enclosed in quotes.
