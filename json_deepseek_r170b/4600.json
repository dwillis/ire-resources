Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The user provided a detailed structure and specific instructions.

First, I'll look for the `id`. It should be 4600 as per the instruction. Next, I need to extract the authors. From the input, Doug Haddix is listed with his email and affiliation to IRE/NICAR. Since there are no other authors mentioned, the list will only include him.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE/NICAR, so that's straightforward. The year isn't provided in the text, so it'll be "Not Listed". 

For the title, I'll go with something descriptive like "Investigating Individuals: A Tipsheet for Journalists" since the content focuses on methods to investigate people.

The description needs to be concise, summarizing the tipsheet's purpose. It should mention public records and online resources used in investigative journalism.

Keywords are next. I'll pick relevant terms from the text: "investigative journalism", "public records", "background checks", "online research", and "journalist tools". These capture the essence without overlapping with the conference or authors.

I have to ensure all keys and values are in English, enclosed in quotes, and no markdown is used. Also, avoid making up any information not provided.
