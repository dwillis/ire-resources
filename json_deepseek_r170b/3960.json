Alright, I need to create a JSON object from the given input for an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) tipsheet. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, the id is straightforward; it's provided as 3960. Next, I'll look at the authors section. The text mentions Joe Ellis from KXAN TV in Austin, Texas, with his email. There's no other author listed, so the authors array will have just one entry with name "Joe Ellis", email "joe.ellis@kxan.com", and affiliation "KXAN TV".

The conference is clearly stated as IRE National Conference 2013, so the conference key will be "IRE" and the year is 2013.

For the title, it's given directly: "Investigating Hazardous Chemical Site Disasters". The description needs to be a concise summary. I'll note that it provides strategies for reporters covering such incidents, emphasizing community impact and utilizing online resources.

Keywords should be relevant and no more than five. I'll choose "hazardous chemicals", "disaster reporting", "investigative journalism", "EPA", and "OSHA" since they're central to the content.

I need to ensure all keys are in quotes, values are correctly formatted, and there's no extra text outside the JSON structure.
