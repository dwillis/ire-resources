Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The input provided describes "The I-Files," a YouTube channel for investigative reporting.

First, I'll start by identifying each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The id is given as 3754, so that's straightforward.

Next, the authors section. Looking through the text, I see mentions of CIR, INN, ABC, New York Times, NBC, Al Jazeera, BBC, NPR, Pulitzer Center, and AU Investigative Workshop. However, there are no specific author names listed. Since the instruction says not to make up names and to leave name as null if none is provided, each author entry will have name set to null. Their affiliations will be the organizations mentioned.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's set.

For the year, the launch date is July 24, 2012, but there's no mention of the event year. So year should be "Not Listed".

The title is given as "A YouTube Channel for Investigative Reporting," which I'll use directly.

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary in simple language. The main points are that it's a collaborative channel with major contributors aiming to showcase investigative content, increase production capacity, and create a sustainable economic model.

For keywords, I need up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Relevant terms here would be "YouTube," "Investigative journalism," "Collaboration," "Video platform," and "Sustainable reporting."

Putting it all together, each part is structured accordingly with proper JSON syntax, ensuring all values are in English and enclosed in quotes.
