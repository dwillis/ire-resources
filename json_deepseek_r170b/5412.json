Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this response.

First, let's break down the input. The title is "Death Behind Bars: How to investigate your local jail." There are no authors mentioned by name in the text, so the authors array will have elements with null names and other details as null.

The conference is clearly IRE since it's about an IRE event. The year isn't provided, so it should be "Not Listed".

For the description, I need a concise summary of 1-2 sentences. The tipsheet describes how to investigate jail deaths using data requests, public records, and storytelling, leading to systemic change.

Next, keywords. They should exclude the conference name and authors. Relevant terms from the content are "jail deaths," "investigation," "data journalism," "public records," and "systemic problems."

Putting it all together, each key must be enclosed in quotes with proper JSON syntax. I'll make sure there's no markdown formatting as per the user's request.
