Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with certain keys like id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, looking at the data provided, I see two presenters: Daniel X. O'Neil from Everyblock and Jaimi Dowdell from IRE and NICAR. Their emails and affiliations are mentioned, so I can include those in the authors array. The conference is definitely IRE since it's explicitly stated.

The year isn't clearly provided in the text, so according to instructions, I'll set it as "Not Listed". The title of the tipsheet seems to be about data-driven journalism and obtaining public records, so I'll craft a concise title that reflects that.

For the description, I need a 1-2 sentence summary. It should mention the strategies for accessing information, the challenges faced by journalists, and how to overcome those challenges using specific methods like smaller requests or leveraging existing reports.

Next, keywords. I have to pick up to five relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. Terms like "data journalism", "FOIA", "public records", "government transparency", and "investigative reporting" seem appropriate as they capture the essence of the content.

I also need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes, with the structure adhering strictly to JSON formatting. No markdown should be present in the final output.

Let me piece this together step by step, making sure each part aligns with the user's instructions without adding any made-up information.
