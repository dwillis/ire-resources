Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has specified that the response should only include this JSON object without any additional text or markdown.

First, let's break down what each part of the JSON needs to be:

1. **id**: It's given as "T2392".
2. **authors**: This is a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. The tipsheet mentions Holly A. Heyser from The Orange County Register. There are no other authors listed, so this will be the only entry.
3. **conference**: The event was part of an IRE conference, specifically the Better Watchdog Workshop in Sacramento, so it's "IRE".
4. **year**: The year is clearly stated as 2005.
5. **title**: The title provided is "Covering Money in the Statehouse: Eight Ways for the Busy Reporter to Stand Out".
6. **description**: Needs to be a concise summary of the tipsheet. It should mention that it's about making money and state government coverage more engaging with practical advice on budgets, campaign finance, and storytelling techniques.
7. **keywords**: Up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Relevant keywords from the content include "budgets", "campaign finance", "state government", "watchdog journalism", and "storytelling".

I also need to ensure that all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Since the user didn't specify any other languages, everything will be in English.

Now, putting this all together:

- **id**: "T2392"
- **authors**: A list with one object containing name: "Holly A. Heyser", email: null (since not provided), affiliation: "The Orange County Register".
- **conference**: "IRE"
- **year**: 2005
- **title**: As given.
- **description**: Summarized to be clear and concise.
- **keywords**: The selected five terms.

I should double-check that I'm not missing any authors. From the input, only Holly A. Heyser is mentioned, so the authors list will have just her. Also, ensure that all fields are correctly formatted with quotes around each key and string value.

Finally, the JSON structure should be clean without any markdown or additional text, just the object itself.

    }
  ],
