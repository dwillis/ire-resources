Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided an IRE tipsheet from a workshop about investigative podcasting and wants me to create a specific JSON object based on that.

First, I need to parse the input carefully. The main points are under the title "Investigative Reporting … for the Ear" with Charles Lane as the author. His email is charles@wshu.org, and he's affiliated with WSHU/Everytown.

I notice the conference is IRE 2021, so the year should be 2021. The description needs to summarize the tipsheet in one or two sentences, focusing on creating engaging investigative podcasts through scenes, sources, and narrative structure.

For keywords, I'll extract relevant terms like "investigative podcasting," "audio journalism," etc., making sure not to exceed five.

I should ensure that all fields are correctly formatted as per the JSON structure: id 6062, authors with name, email, affiliation. Since there's only one author, the list will have a single entry.

Double-checking to make sure I don't miss any details and that everything aligns with the user's instructions. Time to put it all together into the required JSON format.
