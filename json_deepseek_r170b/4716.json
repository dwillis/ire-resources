Okay, so I need to help create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, the id is fixed at 4716. Got that. Next, authors: there's Nicole Hensley mentioned, affiliated with New York Daily News. I'll list her as the only author since no others are named. Her email isn't provided, so it'll be null. 

The conference is clearly IRE. The year isn't specified in the text, so I'll put "Not Listed". The title of the tipsheet is "Desk Jockey? How to Be There When You Canâ€™t." For the description, I need a concise summary. It's about techniques for reporters covering stories remotely.

Keywords should be up to five, excluding the conference and authors. Looking at the content, terms like "remote reporting," "social media monitoring," "source compilation," "breaking news research," and "digital investigative tools" fit well.

Putting it all together, I structure each key accordingly, ensuring everything is in English and properly quoted.
