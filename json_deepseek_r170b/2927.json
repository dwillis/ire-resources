Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. The input provided includes details about an IRE conference tipsheet titled "PI Techniques For Reporters" from June 8, 2007. 

First, I'll assign the id as 2927 since that's specified. Next, for authors, there are three names: Richard Robertson, Adam Dawson, and Larry Lopez. None of them have emails or affiliations listed, so those fields will be null.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE National Conference, so the conference key will be "IRE". The year is given as 2007, so that's straightforward.

For the title, it's "PI Techniques For Reporters." The description needs to be a concise summary. Looking at the content, it covers how reporters can work with private investigators and alternative research methods, so I'll phrase it accordingly.

Keywords should be up to five terms. The main topics are Private Investigators, Research Methods, Investigative Reporting, Due Diligence, and Asset Investigation. These seem relevant without overlapping too much.

I need to ensure all keys and values are in English and properly quoted. Also, no made-up information; stick strictly to what's provided.
