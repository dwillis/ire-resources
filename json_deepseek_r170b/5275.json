Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. The input provided includes details from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference session titled "Rolling Out the Big Investigation." There are three authors with their contact information and affiliations.

First, I'll assign the id as 5275 since that's specified. Next, for the authors, each one should have a name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the input:

- Angela Hill: name is Angela Hill, email is angela.hill@scripps.com, affiliation is Scripps Washington Bureau.
- Jodie Fleischer: name is Jodie Fleischer, email is jodie.fleischer@nbcuni.com, affiliation is WRC-TV.
- Jeremy Rogalski: name is Jeremy Rogalski, email is jrogalski@khou.com, affiliation is KHOU-TV.

So the authors array will include these three with their respective details. 

The conference is clearly IRE since that's part of the header in the input. The year isn't mentioned anywhere, so it should be "Not Listed." The title is given as "Rolling Out the Big Investigation."

For the description, I need a concise 1-2 sentence summary. The session focuses on creating a story plan and effective rollout strategies for investigations. So the description would mention planning and strategies.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords could be "investigative journalism," "story planning," "digital strategy," "partnerships," and "social media engagement."

I should structure all of this into a JSON object with the specified keys. Making sure each value is in quotes and properly formatted.
