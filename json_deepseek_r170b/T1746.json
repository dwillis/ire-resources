Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, the id is T1746 as specified. Next, authors. Noelle Phillips is listed as the compiler, with her affiliation being the Savannah Morning News. There's no email provided, so that will be null. I need to make sure she's correctly formatted in an array under "authors."

The conference key should be "IRE" since it's from their event. The year isn't mentioned, so it'll default to "Not Listed." 

For the title, it's straightforward: "Educate yourself on the military beat." The description needs to be a concise summary of the tipsheet. It includes books, publications, and websites for journalists covering the military.

Keywords should be up to five terms related to the content. I'll go with "military reporting," "journalism resources," "investigative journalism," "military resources," and "journalist education."

I need to structure all of this into a JSON object without any markdown, ensuring correct syntax with quotes around keys and string values. Let me double-check that all required fields are included and properly formatted.
