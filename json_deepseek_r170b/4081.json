Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step.

First, I need to understand what's being asked. The user has provided some data that looks like it's from a presentation about Fusion Tables at NICAR14. They want me to create a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

The id is given as 4081, so that's straightforward.

Next, the authors should be a list of objects each containing name, email, and affiliation. The text mentions Tim Henderson a few times, including his email tim.hendo@gmail.com. I don't see any other authors mentioned, so the authors array will have just one entry with his details.

The conference is NICAR, which is clear from the text (NICAR14). So that key is set to "NICAR".

For the year, looking at the date provided in the text: 4/3/14. That would be April 3, 2014, so the year is 2014.

The title of the presentation seems to be "Fusion Tables" as it's repeated and appears to be the main topic.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The presentation introduces Fusion Tables for investigative journalism, so I'll craft that into a couple of sentences.

Keywords should include relevant terms without repeating the conference or authors. So terms like "data analysis", "Fusion Tables", "investigative reporting" make sense here.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. No made-up names; since only Tim Henderson is mentioned, others aren't listed, so their details remain null if applicable.

Putting it all together, I structure the JSON with these considerations.

```json
{
  "id": 4081,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Tim Henderson",
      "email": "tim.hendo@gmail.com",
      "affiliation": "Not Listed"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": 2014,
  "title": "Fusion Tables",
  "description": "An introduction to Fusion Tables for investigative journalism, presented at NICAR14 in Baltimore.",
  "keywords": [
    "data analysis",
    "Fusion Tables",
    "investigative reporting"
  ]
}
```
