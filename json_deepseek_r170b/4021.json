Alright, let me try to figure this out. I'm supposed to create a JSON object based on the given input. The user provided some detailed instructions about what each key should contain.

First, I need to set the id as 4021. That seems straightforward. Next, authors is a list where each element has name, email, and affiliation. But in this case, there are no author names mentioned, so each name field will be null. Email and affiliation can also be null since there's no information provided.

The conference key should be one of "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Since the input doesn't specify a conference, I'll default to "Not Listed".

For the year, if it's not clearly identified, we use "Not Listed". The text doesn't mention any specific year, so that's set.

The title should be a concise summary of the topic. Here, it looks like the main focus is on Excel skills for data journalism, so I'll go with something like "Excel Skills for Data Journalism".

Description needs to be 1-2 sentences in simple language summarizing the text. The input talks about various Excel functions and their applications in journalism, so my description will reflect that.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference and authors. I'll pick relevant terms like "data journalism", "Excel skills", "summarizing data", etc., but making sure not to exceed five.

I need to ensure all values are in English and keys are properly quoted. Also, no made-up names for authors since none were provided.
