Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. Let me read through their instructions carefully.

The user provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference titled "Developing an Investigative Mindset" by Lise Olsen and Josh Hinkle. They want this information converted into a specific JSON format with keys like id, authors, conference, etc.

First, the id is given as "5587_a". That's straightforward.

Next, for the authors array: I need to extract each author's name, email, and affiliation. Lise Olsen is affiliated with The Houston Chronicle, so her email and affiliation are clear. Josh Hinkle is from KXAN-TV in Austin, Texas. Both have their contact information provided, so I'll include those.

The conference is mentioned as IRE, so that key is filled easily.

Since the year isn't specified in the text, it defaults to "Not Listed".

For the title, it's explicitly given as "Developing an Investigative Mindset". The description should be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers developing investigative skills through routines and brainstorming, so I'll phrase that into a 1-2 sentence summary.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking at the content, appropriate keywords might include "investigative journalism", "journalist training", "newsroom strategies", "public records", and "source development".

Putting it all together, ensuring each value is properly quoted and formatted in JSON. I need to make sure there are no typos and that all keys are correctly spelled as per the user's instructions.

I think that covers everything the user requested.
