Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. The input provided is about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet focused on environmental data at the state level.

First, let me parse through the information given. The tipsheet is from MaryJo Sylwester of IRE and NICAR Database Library. Her email is maryjo@nicar.org. So, under authors, there will be one entry with her name, email, and affiliation as IRE and NICAR.

The conference mentioned is the IRE National Conference in New York City, June 1, 2000. Therefore, the conference key should be "IRE" and the year is clearly listed as 2000.

For the title, it's straightforward: "Environmental data at the state level."

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet provides six key points about accessing and analyzing environmental data at the state level. So, I'll summarize that into one or two sentences highlighting the main themes.

Keywords should be no more than five relevant terms from the content. Key topics include environmental data, state level, FOIA requests, EPA, and Toxic Release Inventory. These are all central to the tipsheet's focus.

I also need to ensure all keys and values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. The id is given as T1195, so that goes into the JSON as-is.

Finally, I'll structure everything into a JSON object with the specified keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. Each part of the data should fit correctly without any made-up information.

```json
{
  "id": "T1195",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "MaryJo Sylwester",
      "email": "maryjo@nicar.org",
      "affiliation": "IRE and NICAR Database Library"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2000,
  "title": "Environmental data at the state level",
  "description": "A tipsheet highlighting key considerations for accessing and analyzing environmental data at the state level, including sources, challenges, and best practices.",
  "keywords": [
    "environmental data",
    "state level",
    "FOIA requests",
    "EPA",
    "Toxic Release Inventory"
  ]
}
```
