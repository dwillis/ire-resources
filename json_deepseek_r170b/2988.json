Alright, so I'm trying to create a JSON object based on the user's query. Let me break down what they need.

First, the structure: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 2988. That's straightforward.

Next, the authors section. They want a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. But in the provided text, there are no specific names mentioned. So I'll have to leave the authors array empty since we can't make up names.

For the conference, the options are "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Looking at the text, it doesn't mention any conference, so it should be "Not Listed".

The year is also not provided in the text, so that will default to "Not Listed" as well.

Now, the title. The text seems to be a guide for investigative editors, so I'll come up with something like "Guidelines and Best Practices for Investigative Editors".

The description needs to be a concise summary. The text covers managing teams, working with other departments, and dealing with challenges, so I can summarize it as helping editors manage their team and collaborate effectively.

Keywords should be relevant terms without including the conference or authors. Looking at the content, "investigative journalism", "editorial management", "newsroom collaboration", "journalistic practices", and "leadership" seem appropriate.

I think that covers all the required fields. Now I'll structure this into a JSON object as specified.

```json
{
  "id": 2988,
  "authors": [],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Guidelines and Best Practices for Investigative Editors",
  "description": "This text provides advice and strategies for investigative editors on managing their team, working with other newsroom departments, and maintaining high standards of journalistic integrity.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative journalism",
    "editorial management",
    "newsroom collaboration",
    "journalistic practices",
    "leadership"
  ]
}
```
