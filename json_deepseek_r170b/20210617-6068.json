Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions about what each key should contain. Let me break down how I can approach this step by step.

First, the structure of the JSON is clear: it needs to have keys like id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. Each of these has its own requirements.

Starting with the 'id', the user specified that it should be 6068. That's straightforward.

Next, the 'authors' key is a list where each element has name, email, and affiliation. The tipsheet mentions Samantha Sunne as the author. Her email isn't provided, so I'll leave it null. Since she's affiliated with Tools for Reporters, that should be her affiliation.

For 'conference', since this is from an IRE conference, I'll set that accordingly.

The 'year' isn't explicitly mentioned in the text, so I'll default to "Not Listed".

The 'title' of the tipsheet is clearly "Scraping Without Programming".

The 'description' needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers web scraping techniques using tools like Google Sheets functions (ImportHTML and ImportXML) and apps like OutWit Hub, ParseHub, and WebScraper. So I'll summarize that into one or two sentences.

Now, the 'keywords'. These should be relevant terms excluding the conference name and authors. Looking at the content, "web scraping", "ImportHTML", "ImportXML", "Google Sheets", and "data journalism" seem appropriate. I need to ensure there are no more than five keywords.

I also have to make sure that all values are in English since the original text is in English. No keys or values should be made up; if information isn't present, it's left as null or "Not Listed".

Putting it all together, each part of the JSON object should accurately reflect the provided tipsheet without adding any extraneous information.

    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Scraping Without Programming",
  "description": "This tipsheet covers basic web scraping techniques using tools like Google Sheets functions (ImportHTML and ImportXML) and point-and-click apps such as OutWit Hub, ParseHub, and WebScraper. It provides a foundational understanding of HTML elements, XPATH, and how to extract data from webpages without advanced programming.",
  "keywords": [
    "web scraping",

    "ImportXML",
    "Google Sheets",
