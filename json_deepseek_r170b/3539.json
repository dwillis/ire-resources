Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an IRE conference. Let me start by identifying each required key.

First, the id should be 3539 as specified.

Next, authors is a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. The text lists Cheryl W. Thompson with her email and affiliation as The Washington Post. So, that's one author entry.

Conference is IRE since it's from an Investigative Reporters and Editors conference.

Year is 2011 because the event was held in Orlando, FL that year.

Title is "Strategies for Covering the Police Beat and Doing Quick Enterprise Stories."

For description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet offers strategies like developing sources, looking for crime trends, doing ridealongs, checking officer records, attending hearings, reviewing budgets, and obtaining forms. So, summarizing that into 1-2 sentences about covering police beats effectively.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Relevant terms are "police beat," "crime trends," "journalism sources," "public records," and "investigative reporting."

Putting it all together ensures each key is correctly filled with accurate information from the provided text.
