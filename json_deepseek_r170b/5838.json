Alright, so I need to create a JSON object from the provided tipsheet about crowd-powered collaboration in journalism. The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, I'll look for the 'id' which is given as 5838. That's straightforward.

Next, the authors section. From the text, Rachel Glickhouse is listed with her email and affiliation to ProPublica. There are no other authors mentioned, so the list will only have one entry with her details.

The conference is clearly stated as NICAR/IRE 2019, but according to the instructions, I should choose between "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Since it's a combined event, I'll go with "NICAR" for the conference key. The year is 2019 as given.

The title of the tipsheet is "How to build a crowd-powered collaboration".

For the description, I need a concise summary. The text discusses collaborative journalism and using audience input to gather data and report stories. So, a 1-2 sentence summary would capture that essence.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords could be "collaborative journalism", "crowdsourcing", "data collection", "audience engagement", and "investigative reporting".

I need to ensure all keys are in quotes and values as well. The structure should follow the example provided without any markdown.

Let me put it all together step by step, making sure each part aligns with the instructions.
