Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from Julian Sher's presentation at an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each required key step by step.

First, the `id` is provided as 5127, so that's straightforward.

Next, for the `authors` array, I see that Julian Sher is listed with his email and affiliation to CBC. His name is clearly stated, along with his contact information and the organization he's part of. So, each element in the authors list should have `name`, `email`, and `affiliation`. Since there are no other authors mentioned, the array will only contain Julian Sher's details.

The `conference` key needs to be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". The tipsheet mentions IRE, so that's set.

For the `year`, looking through the document, it's listed as 2017 in a couple of places. That makes the year clear and specific.

The `title` is given as "MASTERING THE INVESTIGATIVE INTERVIEW: Questioning the way you take on your targets". I need to make sure that's captured exactly as it appears.

Now, the `description` needs to be a concise summary in 1-2 sentences. The tipsheet covers strategies for conducting effective investigative interviews, including preparation and handling difficult situations. That should suffice.

Lastly, the `keywords` should be up to five relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, appropriate keywords are "investigative interviewing", "interview techniques", "journalism", "media", and "communication". These capture the essence without overlapping with the other keys.

Putting it all together, each value is enclosed in quotes, and the structure follows the specified JSON format.
