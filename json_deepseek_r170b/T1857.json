Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through the requirements step by step.

First, the structure should include id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is given as T1857. 

Looking at the authors section: Margot Williams is listed with her email and affiliation to The Washington Post. Gary Price's name is also mentioned in the context of his tip sheet URL, so he should be included too. However, his email isn't provided, so it will be null.

The conference is clearly IRE DC 2003, which falls under the "IRE" category. The year is 2003 as stated at the end of the document.

For the title, the main heading is "Beyond Google: Supersearching and the Invisible Web". 

The description should be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers various advanced search techniques beyond Google, including government sites, court records, and business databases. So I'll phrase it to reflect that.

Keywords need to be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Relevant keywords here are "supersearching", "invisible web", "government databases", "court records", and "business databases".

I think I've covered all necessary points without missing any key information.
