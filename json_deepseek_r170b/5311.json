Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. Let me read through the instructions carefully.

First, the user provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The task is to structure this into a JSON with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The id should be 5311 as given. Next, authors are listed, but the original text doesn't mention any names, so I'll set name to null for each author. Since there's no email or affiliation provided either, those will also be null.

Conference is clearly "IRE" since it's from an IRE regional workshop. The year is 2017, as stated in the document. The title is "Cultivating the Watchdog in your newsroom."

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet focuses on integrating watchdog journalism into daily newsroom activities, so the summary should reflect that.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords include "watchdog journalism," "newsroom structure," "FOIA requests," "public records," and "investigative reporting."

I'll structure all of this into a JSON object, making sure each key is in quotes and values are correctly formatted. No markdown, just plain JSON.

```json
{
  "id": 5311,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2017,
  "title": "Cultivating the Watchdog in your newsroom",
  "description": "This tipsheet provides strategies for integrating watchdog journalism into daily newsroom operations, including structural changes, resource management, and collaboration with external experts.",
  "keywords": [
    "watchdog journalism",
    "newsroom structure",
    "FOIA requests",
    "public records",
    "investigative reporting"
  ]
}
```
