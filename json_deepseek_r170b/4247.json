Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to create this JSON object based on the user's query and the provided example. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the user wants a response that's only a JSON object describing a tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conferences. The ID should be 4247. So I'll start with that.

Looking at the input, there are details about the Fiesta Bowl’s finances and how analyzing their 990s led to the CEO going to prison. The authors section in the example only includes Craig Harris with his contact info. In my case, the user provided a similar structure but without specific author names except for "Craig Harris" mentioned at the end.

So, I'll create an authors array. Since the text mentions Craig Harris and another author whose name isn't listed, I'll set that as null. But wait, in the example, only one author is listed with details, so maybe here too. Wait, no—the user's query has a contact section at the end: "Contact: Craig Harris" along with his email and Twitter. So perhaps there's only one author.

Wait, looking back, in the sample input, it says "authors is a list containing elements..." but in their example, they have two authors: one with details and another as null. Maybe I need to structure similarly if multiple authors are present.

In my case, from the provided text, I see "Contact: Craig Harris" so that's one author. Are there others? Let me check again. The initial bullet points don't mention other names, only "John Junker" who was fired and went to prison—he's a subject, not an author. So authors list should have just one entry with name "Craig Harris," email from the contact info, and affiliation as Arizona Republic since that's part of his contact.

Next, conference: The example uses "IRE". Since this is about IRE conferences, I'll set it to "IRE" too.

Year: In the provided text, there’s a mention of 2011 in one slide. So I can use that as the year.

Title: It's about analyzing Fiesta Bowl finances leading to the CEO's imprisonment. The example uses a similar title. Maybe something like "How Analyzing Fiesta Bowl Finances Led to Criminal Charges".

Description needs to be 1-2 sentences. Summarize how examining their 990s revealed financial misconduct, leading to legal action.

Keywords: Non-profits, 990s, Fiesta Bowl, Financial Misconduct, Lobbying. Keep it under five terms.

Now, putting it all together in JSON structure with the specified keys and values.
