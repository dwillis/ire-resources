Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the user specified that the id should be 5496. Got it.

Next, authors is a list where each element has name, email, and affiliation. The text mentions Nana Boakye-Yiadom as the author. I don't see an email or affiliation listed for him in the input, so I'll set those to null.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's straightforward. Since the year isn't mentioned anywhere, it will be "Not Listed".

For the title, the main heading is "Finding International Data: Where to look in Africa". That captures the essence, so I'll use that.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about overcoming obstacles in obtaining African data and suggests sources like international organizations, government data, civil society, etc. So I'll summarize it as guidance on finding data despite challenges, listing various reliable sources.

Keywords should be up to five terms. The main topics are International Data, Africa, Government Data, Civil Society, and Open Data Sources. These are all relevant and fit within the limit.

I need to ensure all keys and values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Let me structure this into a JSON object without any markdown.

```json
{
  "id": 5496,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Nana Boakye-Yiadom",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Finding International Data: Where to look in Africa",
  "description": "This tipsheet provides guidance on finding international data sources in Africa, highlighting challenges and suggesting reliable places to obtain data such as international organizations, government agencies, civil society groups, open data platforms, and multinational companies.",
  "keywords": [
    "International Data",
    "Africa",
    "Government Data",
    "Civil Society",
    "Open Data Sources"
  ]
}
```
