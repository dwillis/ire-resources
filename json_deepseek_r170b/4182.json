Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's instructions. Let me go through this step by step.

First, the input provided includes details from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet by Liam Dillon. The tipsheet discusses how sports stadiums, especially NFL stadiums, are often money losers for cities, citing statistics about taxpayer contributions and financial risks.

The user wants a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 4182. For the authors, it's a list where each entry has name, email, and affiliation. I notice Liam Dillon's details are provided, so that goes into the authors array.

The conference is specified as "IRE" since the tipsheet mentions it's from an IRE conference. The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the text, so according to instructions, I'll set it to "Not Listed".

The title should be concise, reflecting the content. The description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary. I'll write something like: "Examines how professional sports stadiums often result in financial losses for local governments and provides tips for reporters investigating stadium deals."

For keywords, I need up to five terms excluding conference and authors. So I'll choose relevant terms like "sports stadiums", "NFL", "taxpayer subsidies", "economic impact", "financial risks".

I must ensure all values are enclosed in quotes and the structure is correct. No markdown, just plain JSON.

Double-checking everything: id 4182, authors with Liam's details, conference IRE, year not listed, title accurate, description clear, keywords relevant.
