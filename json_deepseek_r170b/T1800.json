Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given input from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, looking at the input, it starts with "IRE Better Watchdog Workshop" in Tempe, AZ, on 2-22-03. So the conference is definitely IRE, and the year is 2003.

Next, there's a person named Dan Meyers listed as the Projects Editor at The Denver Post, along with his contact information: phone number 303-820-1555 and email dmeyers@denverpost.com. Since he's associated with The Denver Post, I should include him in the authors list with his name, email, and affiliation.

The main content is titled "Seven ways a government watchdog can chow down." It lists seven tips on investigating finances, contracts, audits, bonds, expenses, lawsuits, and resumes. Each tip includes examples of potential stories or leads for journalists.

Now, moving to the JSON structure. The id should be T1800 as specified. For authors, I have Dan Meyers with his email and affiliation from The Denver Post. If there were more authors, they'd go here, but it looks like he's the only one mentioned.

The conference is clearly IRE, so that goes in the conference field. Year is 2003 since the date provided is February 22, 2003.

The title of the tipsheet is "Seven ways a government watchdog can chow down." The description needs to be a concise summary, maybe something like how it provides strategies for investigative journalists focusing on financial oversight and accountability.

For keywords, I'll extract relevant terms from the content. Finances, contracts, audits, bonds, expenses, lawsuits, resumesâ€”these are all key areas covered. I should limit this list to no more than five, so perhaps finances, contracts, audits, bonds, and lawsuits as they seem most critical.

Putting it all together, each field is populated with the extracted information, ensuring proper formatting and use of null where data isn't available.
