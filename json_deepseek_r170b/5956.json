Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The input includes a list of 30 story ideas presented during a session titled "30 Stories in 60 Minutes" by Patti DiVincenzo and Tony Kovaleski.

First, I'll identify the required keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The user specified that the id should be 5956. 

Next, for the authors section, I need to list all individuals involved. From the input, Patti DiVincenzo and Tony Kovaleski are the presenters. Their emails and affiliations are provided: Patti's email is Patti@ire.org with affiliation "IRE," and Tony's email is Tony.Kovaleski@thedenverchannel.com with affiliation "The Denver Channel." I'll structure each author with name, email, and affiliation.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that goes into the conference key. The year isn't mentioned in the input, so it should be "Not Listed."

For the title, the session's title is "30 Stories in 60 Minutes," which I'll use exactly. 

The description needs to be a concise summary of the content. Since the tipsheet covers various investigative story ideas across different topics like government accountability and public safety, I'll phrase it as a collection of quick-to-research stories.

Keywords should be up to five terms that represent the main themes without including the conference or authors. Looking through the 30 items, common themes are government accountability, public records, data journalism, investigative reporting, and public safety. These will serve as appropriate keywords.

I'll make sure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. The structure should be valid JSON with each key correctly assigned.
