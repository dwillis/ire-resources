Alright, I need to create a JSON object from the given tipsheet for an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has specified certain keys that should be included: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, looking at the provided text, the panel is titled "Insurance Coverage for Investigative Reporters: Everything You Need to Know in One Hour," presented by James T. Borelli from CNA Insurance at the 2010 IRE Conference on June 11th. 

The id should be 3436 as per the user's instruction. For authors, since only James T. Borelli is mentioned, his name will go here. However, there's no email or affiliation provided, so those fields will be null.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, and the year is 2010. The title is taken directly from the panel heading. 

Next, the description needs to be a concise summary of the tipsheet content in simple language. It should cover media liability insurance basics, application processes, policy provisions, and who the information is aimed at.

For keywords, I need up to five relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. The main topics are media liability insurance, underwriting process, coverage options, journalists, and risks. These make appropriate keywords.

I have to ensure all values are in English unless specified otherwise, which they are here. Also, all keys and string values should be enclosed in quotes as per JSON standards.

Putting it all together, the JSON structure will accurately reflect the provided information with the required fields filled appropriately.
