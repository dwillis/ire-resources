Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given input from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the `id` is provided as "T1717". That's straightforward.

Next, the `authors` section. The main speaker listed is Randy Reddick from FACS. His email isn't mentioned, so it will be null. There are other names like Danny Sullivan, C. Sherman, Gary Price, Nora Paul, and Tom Luce, but I should only include authors listed in the tipsheet. Since Randy Reddick is the primary author presenting this session, others might be references rather than co-authors.

The `conference` is clearly "IRE" as it's mentioned multiple times. The `year` is specified as 2002 on each page of the document.

For the `title`, the first heading says "Finding Good Stuff", and another slide mentions "Advanced Searching / Hidden Net". Combining these gives a clear title: "Finding Good Stuff: Advanced Searching / Hidden Net".

The `description` needs to be concise. The tipsheet covers advanced search techniques, hidden internet resources, and tools for journalists. So, I'll summarize that it provides tips on using advanced search features and finding invisible web resources useful for investigative journalism.

Now, the `keywords`. From the content, relevant terms include "Advanced searching", "Hidden Internet", "Search engines", "Invisible web", and "Investigative journalism". These are all key concepts discussed.

I'll structure this into a JSON object with each required field. Making sure that only the necessary authors are included and that all other information is accurately captured.
