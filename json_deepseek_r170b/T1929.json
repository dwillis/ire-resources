Alright, I'm trying to create a JSON object based on the user's instructions. Let me go through the input step by step.

First, the id needs to be T1929 as specified. The authors section is a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. Since the original text doesn't mention any specific authors, I'll leave each author's name as null and set email and affiliation to null too.

Next, the conference should be "IRE" because the input discusses IRE conferences extensively. The year isn't clearly provided, so it will default to "Not Listed". 

For the title, the main focus is on investigative reporting associations, their structure, and funding, so I'll use that as the title. 

The description needs a concise summary. The text talks about how these associations support journalists through training, conferences, and funding, so I'll capture that in 1-2 sentences.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking at the content, "investigative journalism", "professional associations", "funding sources", "training", and "journalist networks" are relevant.

I need to make sure all keys and values are in English and properly quoted. I'll structure it accordingly without adding any extra information beyond what's provided.

    {
      "name": null,

    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigative Reporting Associations: Structure and Funding",
  "description": "This tipsheet discusses the structure, funding sources, and activities of investigative journalism associations like IRE, NICAR, and others. It highlights how these groups support journalists through training, conferences, and resources.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative journalism",
    "professional associations",
    "funding sources",
    "training",
    "journalist networks"
