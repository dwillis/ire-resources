Alright, I need to help the user by creating a JSON object from their provided tipsheet. The user specified that the response should only include this JSON, so my job here is just to generate that correctly.

First, I'll look at the input they gave. It's about avoiding rookie data mistakes and was presented at NICAR18. There are three authors listed with contact info and affiliations. 

I notice the user wants specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The ID is set to 5501. For the authors, I'll list each one with their name, email, and affiliation if available. If any info is missing, it should be null.

The conference is NICAR since it's mentioned as NICAR18, so that goes under "conference". The year is 2018 because of the "18" in NICAR18. The title seems to be about avoiding rookie data mistakes, so I'll phrase that clearly.

For the description, I need a concise summary. It should mention avoiding common pitfalls and ensuring accuracy for journalists. Keywords will include data analysis, reporting, SQL, Excel, best practicesâ€”keeping it to five terms.

I have to make sure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, no markdown since they want just the JSON.
