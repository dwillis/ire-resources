Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id should be "T2520". Got that. Next, authors is a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. The text doesn't mention any authors' names, so I'll set name to null for all entries. Since there are no emails provided, those will also be null. For affiliations, the input mentions several news organizations like Toledo Blade, WSMV-Nashville, etc., so each author's affiliation should reflect their respective organization.

Moving on to conference. The user specified it can be "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Since there’s no mention of a specific conference here, I'll default to "Not Listed".

The year is straightforward—each item has a clear month and year, so I'll extract those correctly.

For the title, each entry seems to have a numbered headline. I can take that as the title. 

Description needs to be a concise 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. I'll paraphrase each investigation's main point without getting too detailed.

Keywords should be up to five terms. I'll pick relevant words from each description, avoiding duplicates and ensuring they capture the essence of each case.

I need to make sure all keys are enclosed in quotes and that values are in English unless otherwise specified. Also, no making up any names or emails—leave them null if not provided.

Let me structure this out, ensuring each part aligns with the user's instructions.
