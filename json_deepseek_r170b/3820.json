Alright, I'm looking at this user query where they want me to create a JSON object from some input with specific keys. The keys are id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is given as 3820. 

First, I need to extract the authors. From the text, there's an email mentioned: Bill Allison at Sunlight Foundation. So, his name is Bill Allison, email is ballison@sunlightfoundation.com, and affiliation is Sunlight Foundation. No other authors are listed, so the list will only have him.

Next, the conference. The user mentioned NICAR in their text, so I'll set that as the conference value.

For the year, I don't see any specific year mentioned in the provided text, so it should be "Not Listed".

The title seems to be about Campaign Finance, so I'll go with "Campaign Finance & Influence".

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The text talks about tracking money in politics using various resources, so I'll craft a simple sentence that captures that essence.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords would be campaign finance, lobbying, FEC, OpenSecrets, and InfluenceExplorer.

Putting it all together, I structure the JSON with these values. Making sure each key is in quotes and proper formatting is maintained.
