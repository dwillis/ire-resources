Alright, so I'm trying to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided specific instructions, so I need to make sure I follow them carefully.

First, I'll identify each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 4202. 

Next, the authors section should be a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. In the input, there's Keli Rabon from KMGH. Her email and phone number are provided, but since I only need email for the JSON, that's what I'll include. Affiliation is clearly KMGH.

The conference is explicitly stated as IRE 2014, so conference is "IRE" and year is 2014.

For the title, it's "Sex crimes: Unraveling the facts about the offenders and the evidence". That seems straightforward.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers investigating rape kits and prosecution rates, so I'll mention both aspects in one or two sentences.

Keywords should be up to five terms. From the content, relevant keywords would include "rape kits", "sexual assault investigations", "DNA testing", "prosecution rates", and "crime labs".

I also need to ensure that all values are in English and enclosed in quotes. No markdown, just plain JSON.

Let me double-check if I missed anything. The user didn't mention other authors, so the authors list only has Keli Rabon. I think that's correct. 

So putting it all together, the JSON should accurately reflect each part of the tipsheet with the specified structure.

```json
{
  "id": 4202,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Keli Rabon",
      "email": "keli.rabon@kmgh.com",
      "affiliation": "KMGH"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2014,
  "title": "Sex crimes: Unraveling the facts about the offenders and the evidence",
  "description": "A tipsheet on investigating rape kits, DNA testing, and prosecution rates in sexual assault cases.",
  "keywords": [
    "rape kits",
    "sexual assault investigations",
    "DNA testing",
    "prosecution rates",
    "crime labs"
  ]
}
```
