Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) tipsheet from a conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id is given as 3073, so that's straightforward. Next, authors. The document lists Kelly Guckian as the Database Editor at the San Antonio Express-News. Since there are no other authors mentioned, the authors array will have only one object with her details.

The conference is specified as the 2008 IRE/NICAR CAR Conference in Houston, TX. So the conference key should be "IRE" since that's one of the options provided and it's part of the event name.

The year is clearly stated as 2008, so I'll use that for the year key.

For the title, the main heading seems to be about backgrounding people on the internet, so that will be the title. 

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers various investigative techniques using online resources like property records and code compliance searches. So I can summarize it as a guide on using internet tools for investigative reporting.

Keywords are next. Looking through the content, relevant terms include backgrounding, internet research, property records, code compliance, and investigative reporting. I'll limit it to these five.

I need to ensure all keys are in English and properly quoted. The authors section only has Kelly Guckian with her affiliation as San Antonio Express-News since that's provided.

Putting it all together, the JSON structure should accurately reflect each part without any made-up information.
