Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors conference. The user has provided some detailed content with speaker information, case studies, and data analysis methods.

First, looking at the id: it should be 4980 as specified. Next, authors are listed as Tom McGinty from Wall Street Journal. His email is provided, so that's straightforward. There's also a mention of Christopher Weaver, Anna Wilde Mathews, but their emails aren't given, so I'll note them with nulls.

The conference mentioned is the 2017 CAR Conference in Jacksonville, FL, which falls under IRE, so conference will be "IRE" and year is 2017. The title seems to focus on marrying documents and data, so that's appropriate.

For the description, it needs a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about police shootings in DC compared to other cities, using data analysis and document review. So I'll capture that essence in one or two sentences.

Keywords should be relevant terms like police shootings, data journalism, document analysis, etc., making sure not to exceed five.

Putting it all together, ensuring each field aligns with the instructions and no made-up info is added.
