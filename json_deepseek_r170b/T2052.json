Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON.

First, I'll start by identifying each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

The id is straightforward; it's given as T2052.

Looking at the authors section, the tipsheet mentions Richard Oâ€™Reilly with his email and affiliation. Since only one author is listed, I'll create a list with a single object containing his name, email, and affiliation.

Next, the conference is NICAR, which is one of the allowed options (IRE, NICAR, Not Listed). The year is clearly stated as 2004.

The title is "Bulletproof CAR Projects," so that goes into the title field.

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet covers planning and executing investigative projects using data, so I'll summarize it in one or two sentences focusing on best practices for data-driven journalism.

Keywords should be relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, "CAR investigative reporting," "data analysis," "database design," "journalism best practices," and "investigative journalism" are appropriate and within the limit of five.

I'll make sure all values are in English and properly quoted. No made-up names or affiliations are added beyond what's provided.
