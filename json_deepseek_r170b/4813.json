Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. Let me read through their instructions carefully.

The input provided is from the 2016 IRE Conference in New Orleans. The session is titled "Broadcast Deep Dives" and features KARE 11 Investigates' story on VA Traumatic Brain Injury exams. There are two authors: Steve Eckert and A.J. Lagoe, both with their emails and affiliations mentioned.

First, the id should be 4813 as specified. The conference is clearly IRE, and the year is 2016 since it's mentioned in the input. 

For the authors array, each entry needs name, email, and affiliation. Steve Eckert's name is provided along with his email and affiliation to KARE 11. Similarly for A.J. Lagoe, their name, email, and affiliation are present.

The title of the tipsheet is "KARE 11 Investigates: Invisible Wounds," which I need to extract from the input.

The description should be a concise summary. The investigation led to the VA re-evaluating 25,000 veterans' TBI exams due to unqualified medical personnel. So, the description will mention this impact and the methods used like checking credentials and finding sources through various organizations.

Keywords are next. I need up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the content, "VA," "TBI," "veterans," "investigative journalism," and "credentials" are relevant.

Putting it all together, each key must be in quotes with values also in quotes. No markdown, just a plain JSON structure as per the user's request.
