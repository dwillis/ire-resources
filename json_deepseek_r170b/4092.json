Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given input from the user's query. The repository provided includes slides from a panel at NICAR14, which stands for the 2014 Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) Conference focused on computer-assisted reporting (NICAR). 

First, I'll note that the ID should be 4092 as specified. Next, looking through the GitHub page, the repository is by "eyeseast," but there are specific presenters listed: Chris Amico, Lena Groeger, and Ryan Pitts. Each of these individuals is from a news organization: The Upshot (NYTimes), ProPublica, and CensusReporter respectively.

The conference is clearly NICAR 2014, so the year is 2014. The title can be inferred as "Responsive Data Visualization" since that's what the repository is about. For the description, I'll summarize it in a couple of sentences: It includes slide decks from three presenters discussing strategies and case studies on responsive data visualization.

Keywords should be relevant but exclude the conference and authors. So terms like responsive design, data visualization, web development make sense. 

I need to structure each author with their name, email (which isn't provided, so null), and affiliation based on their news org. Since the year is clear, I'll set that as 2014.

Putting it all together, I'll format this into a JSON object with all specified keys.
