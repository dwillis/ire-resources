Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me break down what they've given me.

First, the title of the presentation is "How the Internet Works" by Melissa Lewis at NICAR2018. The authors listed are Fedor Zarkhin, Carli Brosseau, and Molly Young, each with their Twitter handles but no emails or affiliations mentioned. 

The description should be a concise summary. From the slides, it's about explaining how the internet works in simple terms, covering layers like physical connections, transport protocols, HTTP methods, DNS, and HTTP status codes.

For keywords, I'll extract relevant terms: Internet basics, Network protocols, Data journalism tools, Web scraping, and Online investigations. These are all key concepts from the presentation.

The conference is NICAR, and the year is 2018 as given in NICAR2018. Now, structuring this into JSON with the specified keys: id set to 5461, authors as a list, each with name null since only Twitter handles are provided. 

I have to make sure all values are properly enclosed in quotes and that I don't include any extra information beyond what's given. Also, ensure that the summary is clear and within one or two sentences.

Let me put this all together now.
