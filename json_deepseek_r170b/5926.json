Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to create this JSON object based on the given tipsheet from the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has provided a detailed response with specific instructions on what keys to include and how each should be populated.

First, let's break down the requirements step by step.

1. **Identify the id**: The id is given as 5926. That part seems straightforward.

2. **Authors**: I need to create a list of authors. Each author object must have name, email, and affiliation. The user provided Daniel Connolly's information:
   - Name: Daniel Connolly
   - Email: danieljamesconnolly@gmail.com
   - Affiliation: The (Memphis) Commercial Appeal

3. **Conference**: It was the 2019 IRE National Conference in Houston, so the conference key should be "IRE".

4. **Year**: Clearly stated as 2019.

5. **Title**: From the input, the title is "Covering immigration when you don’t live near a border".

6. **Description**: Needs to be a concise summary of 1-2 sentences in simple language. The tipsheet helps reporters covering immigration in non-border areas start from scratch and build up to complex stories.

7. **Keywords**: A list of no more than five terms. From the content, relevant keywords are "immigration reporting", "investigative journalism", "community reporting", "source building", "ethics in journalism".

Now, I need to structure this into a JSON object with all keys enclosed in quotes and proper syntax.

I should make sure that:
- The authors array only includes Daniel Connolly since no other authors are mentioned.
- Emails and affiliations are correctly placed under each author.
- Description is succinct and captures the essence without being too detailed.
- Keywords are relevant and within the limit of five.

Double-checking for any missing information or possible errors. I think that covers all the points the user specified. Time to put it all together in the JSON format.
