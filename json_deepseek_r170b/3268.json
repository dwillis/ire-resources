Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. First, I'll parse the input to extract relevant information.

The user provided details from Andrew Donohue of voiceofsandiego.org, including his email and phone number. He presented a panel titled "Creating and managing a local nonprofit online daily publication" at an IRE conference in 2009. The tipsheet includes sections on getting started, content focus, revenue streams, and marketing.

I'll start by setting the id to 3268 as instructed. For authors, since only Andrew is mentioned, his details will be included with affiliation as voiceofsandiego.org. 

Next, the conference is clearly IRE, and the year is 2009 based on the footer. The title is taken directly from the panel name. The description needs to be a concise summary; I'll focus on the main points of starting a nonprofit news organization.

Keywords should capture the essence without including the conference or author names. Terms like "nonprofit journalism," "local news," "online publication," and others fit well, limited to five.

Finally, I'll structure all these elements into the JSON format as specified, ensuring each key is correctly formatted with quotes.
