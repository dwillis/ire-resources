Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to create a JSON object based on a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. They provided detailed content about budgeting, bonds, swaps, and public-private partnerships.

First, I need to identify the key elements: id is given as 2955. Then, authors. Looking through the text, David Dietz is listed with his contact info at Bloomberg Markets Magazine, so I'll include him in the authors list. No other authors are mentioned, so that's it.

Next, conference should be "IRE" since it's from their event. The year isn't explicitly stated, so I'll put "Not Listed". For the title, the main heading is about budgets and finance, so I'll use that as the title.

The description needs to be a concise summary. I'll focus on the main topics covered: investigating financial aspects of city government including budgeting, bonds, swaps, and public-private partnerships.

Keywords should include no more than five terms. The primary areas are budgeting, municipal bonds, swaps, public-private partnerships, and financial investigations.

Putting it all together, ensuring each field is correctly formatted and enclosed in quotes as per JSON standards.
