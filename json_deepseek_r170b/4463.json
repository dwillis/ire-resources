Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the ID is provided as 4463, so that's straightforward. 

Looking at the authors section, there's only one author mentioned: Ken Armstrong from The Marshall Project. His email is listed as karmstrong@themarshallproject.org and his Twitter handle is @bykenarmstrong. Since the affiliation isn't explicitly stated next to his name but it's clear he's from The Marshall Project, I'll use that for his affiliation.

The conference is obviously IRE since it's from an IRE tipsheet. As for the year, the text doesn't specify when the conference took place, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

The title of the tipsheet is "Beyond Words: Storytelling at the intersection of cool & creative". For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about using non-traditional methods like web comics and interactive graphics for storytelling, so I can capture that in a couple of sentences.

Keywords should be no more than five and exclude the conference name and authors. Looking through the content, terms like "storytelling", "investigative journalism", "creative techniques", "multimedia", and "collaboration" seem appropriate.

I think I've covered all the necessary parts without missing any key information.
