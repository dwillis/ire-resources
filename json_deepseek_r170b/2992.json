Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user provided a detailed tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference about digging deeper into sports stories. They want me to create a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, the id is given as 2992, so I'll set that directly. Next, looking at the authors section. Christine Willmsen is listed with her email and affiliation as Seattle Times. Since there's only one author mentioned, the authors array will have just one object containing her details.

The conference is explicitly stated as IRE, so that's straightforward. The year isn't provided in the text, so it'll be "Not Listed". 

For the title, the given header is perfect: "Digging deeper into sports stories - on and off the court." It clearly summarizes the content.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet focuses on using public records to uncover sports stories, so I'll phrase it as investigative techniques using those records.

Keywords should capture the essence without being too broad. Public Records, Sports Reporting, Investigative Journalism fit well, and since booster clubs are mentioned, that's another keyword. Athletic Associations ties into state-level information, making five relevant terms.

Putting it all together, each part is addressed methodically to ensure the JSON meets the user's specifications accurately.
