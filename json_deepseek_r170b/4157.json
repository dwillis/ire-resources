Okay, so I'm trying to create this JSON object from the provided tipsheet on finding sources for investigative journalism. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the user has specified that the id should be 4157. That's straightforward; I just set "id" to 4157.

Next up are the authors. The input lists four people: Andres Cediel, Ellen Gabler, Tony Kovaleski, and Ellen Weiss. Each of them has an email provided. For their affiliations, since the text doesn't mention any specific organizations next to their names except for their emails, I need to check if the emails hint at their affiliations. 

- Andres Cediel's email is andresacediel@gmail.com. Since it's a Gmail account, there's no clear organization listed, so his affiliation should be null.
- Ellen Gabler's email is egabler@jrn.com. The domain "jrn.com" might stand for Journal Sentinel or another news organization. I think it refers to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, so her affiliation would be that.
- Tony Kovaleski's email is tony.kovaleski@nbcuni.com. NBCUni clearly stands for NBCUniversal, so his affiliation is NBCUniversal.
- Ellen Weiss's email is ellenrweiss@gmail.com. Again, a Gmail account without any organizational hint, so her affiliation is null.

Now, moving on to the conference. The tipsheet mentions it's from IRE (Investigative Reporters and Editors), so the conference key should be "IRE".

The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the text, so according to the instructions, year should be set to "Not Listed".

For the title, the main focus is on managing sources, so I'll go with something like "Managing Sources: Tips for Investigative Journalists".

The description needs a concise summary. The document provides tips on building trust and persistently gathering information from sources, so I'll phrase it as a 1-2 sentence overview of that.

Keywords are next. They should be no more than five terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords could be "investigative journalism", "source management", "journalism tips", "persistence", and "accuracy".

Putting it all together, I structure each part carefully to ensure all fields are correctly filled out without making up any information and adhering strictly to the provided data.
