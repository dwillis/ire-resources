Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through this step by step.

First, I'll identify the required keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 4061, so that's straightforward.

Looking at the authors section, the tipsheet mentions Daniel Lathrop. There's no email or affiliation provided, so those will be null. But since he presented at IRE's CAR Conference, his affiliation could be inferred as IRE, but the instructions say not to make up affiliations unless specified, so it's safer to leave it null.

The conference is clearly stated as "CAR Conference 2014," which falls under IRE, so the conference key should be "IRE".

The year is listed as 2014-02-28, so that will go into the year field.

For the title, it's "Fusion Tables for Beginners."

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers importing data, examining, merging, and using visualization tools in Fusion Tables. So I'll phrase it as a 1-2 sentence overview.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking at the content, "Fusion Tables," "Google," "data visualization," "cloud database," and "SQL" are relevant keywords.

Putting it all together, each part is filled out based on the information extracted from the tipsheet.

```json
{
  "id": 4061,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2014,
  "title": "Fusion Tables for Beginners",
  "description": "A beginner's guide to using Google Fusion Tables for data analysis and visualization.",
  "keywords": ["Fusion Tables", "Google", "data visualization"]
}
```
