Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided specific instructions on the structure and what each key should contain.

First, I'll look at the id, which is clearly 3438 as per the input. Next, for authors, there's Nicole Vap listed with her affiliation as 9News Denver. Since email isn't provided, it will be null. 

The conference is IRE because that's mentioned in the header. The year is 2010, taken from the copyright information at the end of the document.

The title is "WORKING THE EDGES," which seems to be the main heading. For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about preparing for disasters with checklists and post-disaster strategies, so I'll phrase that into one or two sentences.

Keywords should be relevant terms from the content but excluding conference names and authors. Disaster preparation, spot news, investigative reporting, and breaking news are all key themes here, totaling five keywords.

I must ensure all keys are in English and enclosed in quotes. No made-up data; if something isn't present, it's null or omitted as per instructions.
