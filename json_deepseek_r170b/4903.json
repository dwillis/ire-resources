Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given input. The user provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id is specified as 4903, so that's straightforward.

Next, the authors section requires a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. In the input, Trevor Aaronson and Kelly Virella are listed along with their affiliations: Florida Center for Investigative Reporting and The Investigative Fund respectively. There are no emails provided, so those fields will be null.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's set. The year is mentioned in the text as 2016, specifically in the section about being prepared for IRE 2016.

For the title, the main heading translates to "Key Tools and Techniques for Freelance Journalists and Small Newsrooms." That seems accurate.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers tools like Excel, Google Refine, collaboration software such as Dropbox and Google Drive, encryption methods like PGP and Signal, and mobile tools. So I'll summarize that it provides essential resources for freelancers and small newsrooms to enhance their investigative reporting efficiency.

Keywords should include terms like "freelance journalists," "investigative journalism tools," "data analysis," "encryption," and "collaboration software." These capture the main topics without including the conference name or authors.

I also need to ensure that all values are in English since the original text is in Spanish, but the JSON keys and structure remain consistent. All strings should be properly quoted, and there shouldn't be any markdown formatting.

Let me double-check each section to make sure I didn't miss anything. The affiliations are correctly assigned based on the input, and all required fields are included with appropriate null values where necessary.

I think that covers everything the user asked for. Time to put it all together in the JSON format.
