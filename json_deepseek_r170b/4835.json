Okay, so I have to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an IRE conference. Let's break down what needs to be done.

First, the structure should include id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is already given as 4835.

Looking at the document, the author mentioned is Jorge Luis Sierra, who is affiliated with ICFJ Knight Fellow. His email isn't directly provided, but in the contact info, it's listed as jorge.sierra@latinointx.com. So, for authors, I can include his name, email, and affiliation.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE 2016, so the conference key will be "IRE" and the year is 2016. The title of the tipsheet is "BULLETPROOFING DIGITAL NEWSROOMS".

For the description, it needs to be a concise summary. The document talks about strategies for producing high-risk stories while ensuring safety against various threats like physical attacks and cyber espionage. So, I can phrase it as protecting journalists and newsrooms from such risks.

Keywords should include relevant terms without repeating the conference or authors. Terms like "Risk Analysis", "Digital Security", "Journalist Safety", "Cybersecurity", and "Investigative Journalism" seem appropriate.

Putting this all together, the JSON structure is formed with these elements.
