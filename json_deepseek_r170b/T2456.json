Alright, I need to help the user create a JSON object based on their query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, the structure: they want a JSON with specific keysâ€”id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. Each key has certain requirements. The id is given as T2456, so that's straightforward.

Looking at the content provided, it's about a session titled "Banking on the Poor: Documenting the Big Business of Poverty" presented by Ron Nixon from the Minneapolis Star Tribune and Holly Hacker from the Dallas Morning News. The conference was in Hollywood, C.A.R., March 17-20. 

For authors, I need to list each with name, email, and affiliation. Ron's email is given as rnixon@startribune.com, so his affiliation is the Star Tribune. Holly doesn't have an email listed, but since she's from the Dallas Morning News, that's her affiliation.

The conference location is Hollywood C.A.R., which I think refers to a specific event, maybe not one of the main ones like IRE or NICAR. So the conference key should be "Hollywood C.A.R." and year as "Not Listed" since the exact year isn't provided.

Title is clear: "Banking on the Poor: Documenting the Big Business of Poverty."

Description needs to be a concise 1-2 sentences summarizing the session's focus. It discussed the fringe financial industry targeting low-income individuals, including payday lenders and others. So I'll craft that into a brief summary.

Keywords should include up to five relevant terms without mentioning the conference or authors. Fringe financial industry, payday lenders, check cashing outlets, car title loans, sub-prime loans are all key topics here.

Putting it all together, ensuring each part is correctly formatted as per JSON standards with proper quotation marks and structure.
