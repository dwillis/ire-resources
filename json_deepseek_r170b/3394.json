Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each key step by step.

First, the id is clearly provided as 3394, so that's straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors section. The tipsheet mentions John Diedrich with his email and affiliation to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. There's no other author listed, so I'll include him as the sole entry in the authors array. His name, email, and affiliation are all present, so those will be filled accordingly.

The conference is mentioned as the 2010 IRE National Convention in Las Vegas, so the conference key should be "IRE".

For the year, it's explicitly stated as 2010, so that goes into the year field without any issues.

The title of the tipsheet is given as "Criminal justice investigations: tips from unexpected people and documents". That will be placed in the title key.

Now, the description needs to be a concise 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet focuses on strategies for reporters investigating criminal justice, including sources like federal agents, local cops, and others, as well as documents such as search warrants and trial exhibits. So I'll craft a simple summary that captures these points.

Moving on to keywords, they should be relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking through the content, suitable keywords could be "criminal justice", "investigations", "sources", "documents", and "reporters". These are all central themes of the tipsheet.

I'll structure each part accordingly, making sure that all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes as per JSON standards. I also need to ensure there are no made-up names; since only John Diedrich is listed, others aren't included. Emails and affiliations are provided where available.

Putting it all together, the final JSON should accurately represent each key with the correct data extracted from the tipsheet.
