Alright, so I'm trying to create this JSON object based on the provided query. Let me break down what's needed here.

First, the user wants an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) tipsheet as a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 5513. 

Looking at the content provided, it's about "Mass FOIA Requests" presented by Steven Rich. His contact info includes an email and affiliation. I'll need to structure the authors as a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation.

The title seems straightforward: "Mass FOIA Requests (and how to do them better than me)". The description should be a concise summary of the tipsheet, focusing on the key points like strategies for filing multiple FOIA requests efficiently, handling denials, and data analysis. I'll make sure it's 1-2 sentences.

The conference is clearly labeled as #IREWatchdog, so that goes under "conference". Since there’s no year mentioned in the text, I’ll set "year" to "Not Listed".

For keywords, I need up to five relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. The content touches on FOIA requests, data collection, standardization, exemptions, and legal strategies. So those will be my keywords.

Now, putting it all together, ensuring each key is in quotes and properly formatted. Let me double-check that all required fields are filled and the structure is correct.
