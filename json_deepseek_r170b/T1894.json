Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors conferences. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll identify each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

Starting with the id, it's given as T1894. Easy enough.

Next, for authors. The tipsheet mentions Don Nelson and another author whose name isn't listed. So, I'll create two entries in the authors list. For the first author, name is "Don Nelson", email is null, and affiliation is "Time Magazine" since that's mentioned. The second author has a null name, so both email and affiliation will be null.

Conference should be "IRE" because it's from Investigative Reporters and Editors. 

The year isn't specified in the text, so I'll set it to "Not Listed".

Title is straightforward: "Investigative Reporting Tipsheet".

Description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers planning, research, writing, and organization, so I'll phrase that into one sentence.

Keywords should include investigative reporting, research methods, journalism, writing techniques, and organization systems. Keeping it to five relevant terms.

I need to make sure all keys are enclosed in quotes and the structure is correct with proper commas and brackets. No markdown, just plain JSON.
