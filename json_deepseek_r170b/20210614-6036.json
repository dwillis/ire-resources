Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's instructions. Let me go through the input step by step.

First, the id should be 6036 as specified. Now, looking at the text provided, there are no authors mentioned. So, the authors array will have an element with name null and both email and affiliation as null since there's no information about any news organization either.

Next, determining the conference. The input talks about outlining techniques for journalism, which I recall is often covered in NICAR conferences (National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting). There's no explicit mention of another conference like IRE or others, so I'll go with "NICAR".

For the year, thereâ€™s no specific date provided in the text. Therefore, the year will be "Not Listed".

The title should reflect the main topic, which is about outlining techniques for journalists. So, I'll name it "Outlining Techniques for Journalists".

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The text discusses methods to organize stories and improve writing efficiency, so I can write something like: "A guide on outlining techniques to help journalists efficiently organize and write their stories."

For keywords, they should be relevant and not include the conference or authors. Key terms from the text are "outlining", "journalists", "writing techniques", "story organization", and "efficiency".

Putting it all together, I structure each part into the JSON format as instructed.

```json
{
  "id": "6036",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Outlining Techniques for Journalists",
  "description": "A guide on outlining techniques to help journalists efficiently organize and write their stories.",
  "keywords": [
    "outlining",
    "journalists",
    "writing techniques",
    "story organization",
    "efficiency"
  ]
}
```
