Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's instructions. The input provided seems to contain multiple entries from what looks like a NICAR conference or something similar. Each entry has tips and resources for journalists, especially related to data journalism.

First, I should identify the required keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as T1840. 

Looking through the text, there are mentions of people like Randy Myers, but it's not clear if they're the authors or just contributors. Since the user said not to make up names and leave null if none are listed, I'll set authors to an empty list for now.

The conference is NICAR because that's explicitly mentioned in the text multiple times, so conference will be "NICAR". The year isn't clearly stated, so it should be "Not Listed".

For the title, since each entry starts with a number and a description, but there's no specific title given, I'll use something generic like "Data Journalism Tips and Resources" to encapsulate the content.

The description needs to be 1-2 sentences. The text provides various resources for journalists, such as FAA data, contracts databases, bird strike information, etc., so I can summarize that it's a collection of resources for investigative journalists covering data sources.

Keywords should be up to five terms. From the content, relevant keywords would include "Data Journalism", "Investigative Reporting", "FAA", "Contracts Database", and "Bird Strikes".

Putting it all together, ensuring everything is in English and properly quoted.
