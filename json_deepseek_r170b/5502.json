Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on this tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conferences. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id is given as 5502, which is straightforward.

Next, looking for authors. At the end of the document, there's an email: zivabranstetter and zbranstetter@revealnews.org. The name here seems to be Ziva Branstetter, so I'll include that with her email and affiliation as RevealNews since it's part of the email.

The conference is clearly IRE because the tipsheet mentions "Investigative Reporters and Editors conferences."

For the year, I don't see any specific dates or years mentioned in the document. So I'll put "Not Listed" for that field.

The title isn't explicitly stated, but looking at the content, it's about strategies for obtaining public records and data. So a suitable title would be something like "Strategies for Obtaining Public Records and Data."

Now, the description should be a 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet provides advice on how journalists can effectively request and manage public records and data, so I'll condense that into a concise statement.

Keywords are next. Scanning through the document, key terms include "public records," "data collection," "FOIA requests," "government transparency," and "investigative journalism." I'll pick these five as they encapsulate the main topics.

Putting it all together, I structure each part carefully to ensure all keys are included and values are correctly formatted. I make sure not to include any markdown and only use English unless specified otherwise.

I think that covers everything needed for the JSON object based on the provided tipsheet.

    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Strategies for Obtaining Public Records and Data",
  "description": "A tipsheet providing strategies for effectively requesting public records, avoiding common pitfalls in data collection, and understanding legal frameworks.",
  "keywords": [
    "public records",
    "data collection",
    "FOIA requests",
