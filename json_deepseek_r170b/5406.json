Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's instructions from their query. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the user provided some details about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The id is given as 5406, so that will be straightforward.

Looking at the authors section: there's only one author listed, Margot Williams. Her email and affiliation aren't mentioned, so those will remain null. I should make sure to structure her entry correctly within an array under "authors".

The conference is NICAR 2018, which corresponds to the year March 2018. So, the conference key will be "NICAR" and the year will be 2018.

For the title, it's clearly labeled as "Safe Searching". The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers secure search methods and accessing deep web information, so I'll craft a brief sentence that encapsulates that.

Keywords are next. I should pick up to five relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, "safe searching", "deep web", "online investigation", "public records", and "Tor" seem appropriate.

I also need to ensure all keys and string values are in English and properly quoted. No markdown or extra textâ€”just a clean JSON object.

```json

  "id": 5406,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Margot Williams",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": 2018,
  "title": "Safe Searching",
  "description": "Tips and strategies for secure searching, accessing deep web information, and verifying documents.",
  "keywords": [
    "safe searching",
    "deep web",
    "online investigation",
    "public records",
    "Tor"
  ]
}
```
