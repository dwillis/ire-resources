Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference, specifically NICAR. The user has given me some detailed instructions about what each key should contain.

First, let's break down the input. The title is "LEARN FROM OUR FAILS" and it's from a NICAR conversation on March 8, 2018. There are several bullet points listing lessons learned, like not pulling all-nighters, checking data accuracy before tweeting, using color codes correctly, etc.

The JSON structure needs to have specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The ID is given as 5360, so that's straightforward.

For the authors, I see that there are no names listed in the provided text. So each author entry should have name as null, email as null, and affiliation as "Investigative Reporters and Editors" since that's the organization hosting the event.

The conference is clearly NICAR, which falls under IRE, so the value here will be "NICAR". The year is explicitly given as 2018 in the date March 8, 2018.

The title should exactly match what's provided: "LEARN FROM OUR FAILS".

Now for the description. It needs to be a concise summary of the content. Since the tipsheet covers various lessons learned from past failures in data journalism, the description can mention that it's a collection of tips and best practices for handling data and avoiding common pitfalls.

Keywords should be no more than five terms. I'll extract relevant terms like "data journalism", "investigative reporting", "best practices", "NICAR tips", and "common pitfalls". These encapsulate the essence of the content without overlapping with the conference name or authors.

Putting it all together, each part is mapped accordingly to form a complete JSON object.
