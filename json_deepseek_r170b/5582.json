Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to create a JSON object based on specific guidelines from a tipsheet provided during an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. 

First, I'll identify the main sections of the input. It starts with some slide headers about web searching and social media for watchdogs, mentioning Denise Malan and her contact info. So, the author is Denise Malan, affiliated with IRE.

The tipsheet covers various aspects like search strategies, backgrounding sources, using advanced Google operators, alternative search engines, tools for archiving websites, people finders, business and property research, social media sleuthing, image verification, multimedia tools, academic resources, organizing tools, and setting up alerts. 

I need to extract keywords from these sections without including the conference or author names. The main topics here are web searching, backgrounding sources, advanced search operators, people finders, business records, social media sleuthing, image verification, archiving tools, and alerts.

The description should be a concise summary of the tipsheet in simple language, so I'll mention it's about investigative research techniques covering these areas.

Since Denise Malan is the author with her email provided and affiliation to IRE, the authors array will have one entry with her details. 

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, but the year isn't mentioned, so that field remains "Not Listed". The id is given as 5582.

Putting it all together, I structure the JSON object accordingly.
