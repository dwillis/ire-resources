Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided query and data. The user has given specific instructions about the structure and content.

First, I'll identify the id as 3547 since that's specified. Next, for the authors, there's Jill Riepenhoff listed with her email and affiliation. So, her name is filled in, email is jriepenhoff@dispatch.com, and affiliation is The Columbus Dispatch. 

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that goes into the conference field. The year is 2011 because the event is labeled Conference 2011. 

For the title, it's "The Unsung Documents of College Athletics." The description needs to be a concise summary. I'll focus on the main idea about uncovering hidden documents in college sports that reveal NCAA violations and financial dealings.

Keywords should be up to five terms. I'll pick the most relevant ones: college athletics, NCAA violations, financial records, compliance audits, and public records.

I need to make sure all keys are in quotes and the structure is correct without any markdown. Everything looks good now.
