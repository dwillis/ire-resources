Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's instructions. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the id is given as T2371, so that's straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors section. There are two people mentioned: David Donald and Holly Hacker. For each author, I need their name, email, and affiliation.

David Donald's info:
- Name: David Donald
- Email: ddonald@ire.org
- Affiliation: Investigative Reporters & Editors (since he's the Training Director there)

Holly Hacker's info:
- Name: Holly Hacker
- Email: hhacker@dallasnews.com
- Affiliation: The Dallas Morning News (her employer as an education reporter)

Now, the conference is clearly stated as 2005 NICAR Conference in Hollywood, CA. So conference key will be "NICAR".

The year is 2005, so that's set.

Title of the tipsheet is "Eight Safeguards: A Stats Checklist", which is explicitly mentioned.

For the description, I need a concise summary. The text talks about effectively and safely using statistics in journalism. So something like: "A checklist for journalists on using statistics effectively and safely in their investigations."

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords are "statistics", "journalism", "investigative reporting", "data analysis", and "methodology".

Putting it all together, I structure each part into the JSON format as specified. Making sure all keys and values are in quotes and proper syntax is maintained.
