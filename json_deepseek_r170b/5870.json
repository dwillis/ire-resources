Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tip sheet from an IRE conference in 2019. The user specified several keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. 

First, the id is straightforwardâ€”it's 5870 as provided. Next, for the authors section, there are three names listed without emails or affiliations. Since their emails aren't given, I'll leave them as null. The affiliations should be taken from the text; for example, Catalina Lobo-Guerrero is affiliated with the Global Investigative Journalism Network, and so on.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE 2019, so I'll fill that in under "conference" and set the year to 2019. The title should be concise, maybe "Cross-Border Investigations." 

For the description, it needs to be a brief summary of the tip sheet's content. It's about best practices for journalists collaborating across borders, covering partnerships, communication, security, etc.

Keywords are next. I'll pick relevant terms like collaboration, cross-border, investigations, security, and partnerships. These capture the essence without overlapping too much with the conference or authors' names.

I also need to ensure all values are in English unless specified otherwise and that everything is properly enclosed in quotes as per JSON standards. Let me structure each part step by step to avoid missing any details.

```json

  "id": 5870,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,

    },
    {

      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Columbia University"
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "International Consortium of Investigative Journalists"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2019,
  "title": "Cross-Border Investigations",
  "description": "A tipsheet providing guidance on best practices for cross-border investigative journalism collaborations, covering topics such as partner selection, communication strategies, and security measures.",
  "keywords": [
    "collaboration",
    "cross-border",
    "investigations",
    "security",
    "partnerships"
  ]
}
```
