Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. Let me start by carefully reading through their instructions.

First, they want an object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is fixed as 5380. 

Looking at the input provided, I see mentions of NICAR18, which indicates this is related to the NICAR conference. So, the conference key should be "NICAR". Since it's NICAR18, that suggests the year was 2018.

Next, for the authors section, there are several names listed with their affiliations and emails. For each author, I need to extract name, email, and affiliation. The user mentioned not to make up any names, so if a name isn't provided, leave it null. But in this case, all authors have names listed.

I notice the first few lines mention Kennedy, followed by NICAR18, then other names like Martin and Satterberg with emails. I'll list each author as an object within the authors array. Each entry should include their name, email (if available), and affiliation, which seems to be the news organizations they're from.

The title of the session or presentation isn't explicitly stated in the input, but based on the content about reoriented story forms and user experience, I can infer a suitable title like "Re-oriented Story Forms and User Experience."

For the description, it should be a concise summary. The text discusses how breaking conventional left-right and top-bottom orientations in storytelling can enhance user experience, so I'll phrase that into 1-2 sentences.

Keywords need to be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords could be "user experience," "storytelling," "orientation," "design," and "interaction."

I should ensure all values are in English as per the instructions. Also, every key and value must be enclosed in quotes.

Putting it all together, I structure each part carefully, making sure not to miss any details from the input. Double-checking that emails are correctly placed under their respective authors and affiliations are properly noted.

Finally, I review the JSON for syntax correctness, ensuring commas are in the right places and no trailing commas exist. This should meet all the user's requirements accurately.
