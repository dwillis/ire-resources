Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's instructions from the given input. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the user provided a tipsheet titled "Investigating Transportation: Construction Costs" by Brian M. Rosenthal from The New York Times. They want this information converted into a specific JSON format with keys like id, authors, conference, year, etc.

Starting with the id: it's specified as 5636_2, so that goes straight in.

Next, the authors section. There's only one author mentioned, Brian M. Rosenthal. His email is provided as Brian.Rosenthal@nytimes.com and his affiliation is The New York Times. So I'll structure this as an array with a single object containing name, email, and affiliation.

For the conference field, since the tipsheet mentions it's from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE), that should be the value here.

The year isn't explicitly stated in the input, so according to instructions, it should be "Not Listed".

Now, the title is straightforward: "Investigating Transportation: Construction Costs".

The description needs a concise summary. The tipsheet provides methods for journalists to investigate high transportation construction costs using federal data and local records. I'll condense that into one or two sentences.

Keywords are next. I should pick up to five terms. Looking through the content, terms like "transportation", "construction costs", "investigative journalism", "FTA", and "NTD" are relevant. But since keywords shouldn't include conference or authors, those are safe choices.

I need to ensure all keys are in English and properly quoted. Each value should be a string unless it's an array or null. Also, no made-up namesâ€”since only Brian is mentioned, that's the only author.

Double-checking the structure: id is correct, authors have all required fields filled, conference is IRE, year is not listed, title and description are accurate, keywords are relevant and within the limit.

I think that covers everything. Now, putting it all together in JSON format as specified.
