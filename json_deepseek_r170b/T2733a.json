Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an IRE conference. Let me start by identifying each required key.

First, the id should be T2733a as specified. The title is "Digging Into the Environment" and it's from the IRE 2006 Fort Worth conference, so the conference key is "IRE" and the year is 2006.

Next, looking at the authors. There's only one author mentioned: Matthew Waite from the St. Petersburg Times. Since there's no email provided, I'll leave that as null. His affiliation is clearly stated, so I can include that.

For the description, it should be a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about using various data types and tools for environmental reporting, so I'll mention that.

Keywords need to be up to five relevant terms. Looking at the content, "data journalism," "environmental reporting," "investigative techniques," "wiki software," and "database analysis" fit well.

Putting it all together, ensuring each part aligns with the instructions. No made-up names or emails, just the facts from the text.
