Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet on debugging. Let me break down the requirements.

First, the structure: id is 4624. Authors are in a list with name, email, affiliation. Since no authors are listed, each author entry will have null for name, and email and affiliation can be null too. 

Conference should be "IRE" since it's about their conferences. Year isn't specified, so it's "Not Listed".

The title is straightforward: "Debugging Tips". The description needs to be a brief summary. Looking at the provided content, it's about common errors like SyntaxError, ValueError, etc., and offers advice on debugging. So I'll condense that into one or two sentences.

Keywords should exclude conference and authors, so terms like debugging, programming errors, error handling make sense. They must be in English and within five terms.

Putting it all together, ensuring each key is properly quoted and values are correct.

```json
{
  "id": 4624,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Debugging Tips",
  "description": "A guide to understanding and fixing common errors in programming, including syntax errors, value errors, type errors, attribute errors, name errors, key errors, index errors, and semantic errors. Provides practical advice for debugging.",
  "keywords": [
    "debugging",
    "programming errors",
    "error handling",
    "coding tips",
    "troubleshooting"
  ]
}
```
