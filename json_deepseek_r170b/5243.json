Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given input from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The user provided specific instructions for each key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, the ID is straightforwardâ€”set to 5243 as instructed.

Next, extracting the authors. There's only one author mentioned: Brent Walth from the University of Oregon School of Journalism and Communication, with his email provided. So the authors list will have one object with name, email, and affiliation filled in.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE's 2017 National Conference in Phoenix, Arizona, so conference should be "IRE" and year is 2017.

For the title, it's explicitly given as "Educators' roundtable: Best ways to teach investigative reporting."

The description needs to be a concise summary. The main points are that Brent Walth shares tips for teaching investigative journalism, including assigning stories, using government databases, team projects, and resilience. So I'll condense this into one or two sentences.

Keywords should be relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, "investigative reporting," "journalism education," "story assignments," "government records," and "resilience" seem appropriate.

I need to ensure all keys are in English, enclosed in quotes, and values correctly formatted. No made-up names; since only Brent Walth is listed, authors will have one entry.
