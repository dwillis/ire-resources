Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an IRE conference. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I'll identify the ID as T2233 since that's specified. The title is "12 Steps for Clearer Stronger Writing" and it's from the 2004 IRE Convention in Atlanta. 

Looking at the author info: Al Tompkins is listed with his email, website, and phone number. His affiliation is the Poynter Institute, so I'll include that. There are no other authors mentioned, so the authors array will have only one object.

For the description, it's a 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet provides guidance on improving writing through storytelling techniques, active verbs, and clear language. So I'll craft a concise sentence covering these points.

Keywords should be up to five terms related to the content but excluding the conference and authors. Relevant keywords are "writing tips," "storytelling," "journalism," "clear communication," and "active voice."

The conference is clearly listed as IRE, so that's straightforward. The year is 2004 since it's specified in the input.

I need to ensure all keys are correctly named and values are properly enclosed in quotes. No made-up names; everything should be based on the provided information.
