Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through this step by step.

First, the structure should include id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is T2631 as specified. 

Looking at the authors section: there are two speakers listedâ€”Jennifer LaFleur from The Dallas Morning News and Danielle Cervantes from The San Diego Union-Tribune. Their emails are provided, so I'll include those. Since their affiliations are clear (the newspapers), that's straightforward.

The conference is IRE because it's mentioned in the context of Investigative Reporters and Editors conferences. The year isn't specified anywhere in the text, so it should be "Not Listed".

For the title, it's given as "Bulletproofing your data-based stories". 

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about verifying data integrity, checking for consistency, and other best practices when working with data in journalism. So I'll condense that into one or two sentences.

Keywords should be relevant terms excluding the conference name and authors' names. From the content, "data integrity", "journalism best practices", "data verification", "investigative reporting", and "methodology checks" seem appropriate. 

I think that covers all required fields. Now, putting it all together into a JSON object with proper formatting.
