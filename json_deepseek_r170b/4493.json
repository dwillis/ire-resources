Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's input about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me start by carefully reading through the provided information.

First, the ID is given as 4493, so that will be straightforward. The title of the session is "Broadcast Deep Dives" from the National Conference in Philadelphia during 2015. 

Next, I'll look at the authors. There are two individuals mentioned: Vicky Nguyen and Liz Wagner. Both are affiliated with KNTV NBC Bay Area. Their names, emails, and affiliations are provided, so I can include those details.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE" since it's from an IRE event. The year is 2015, which is explicitly mentioned. 

For the description, I need a concise summary of the tipsheet. It seems to focus on investigative reporting techniques like acting quickly on tips, building trust with sources, and using effective storytelling elements. I'll condense that into one or two sentences.

Keywords should be relevant and limited to five. The main points are broadcasting, investigative journalism, storytelling, sources, and public records. These terms capture the essence without overlapping too much.

I need to structure all this information correctly in JSON format, ensuring each key is properly enclosed in quotes and that all values match the required data types. I'll make sure there are no made-up names and handle any missing information by setting them to null if necessary.

Double-checking everything to ensure accuracy, especially email addresses and affiliations, which are provided. The URLs mentioned aren't needed for the JSON, so I can ignore those.

Putting it all together now.
