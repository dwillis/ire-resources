Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on this tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each requirement step by step.

First, the id is given as 4586. That's straightforward. Next, authors: looking at the text, I see "@MeganLuther" and "@IRE_NICAR". Megan Luther seems to be the presenter, so her name should be "Megan Luther", email null, affiliation "Star Tribune" because that's mentioned in the examples. Then there's another author listed as "@IRE_NICAR", which is likely an organization, so their name would be "IRE_NICAR", but since it's more of a handle, maybe just list it as "NICAR" with null email and affiliation as IRE.

The conference is either IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed. Since the tipsheet mentions both IRE and NICAR, but the primary conference here is NICAR, so I'll put that. Year isn't mentioned, so "Not Listed".

Title should capture the main theme: probably something about using data and documents in investigations, like "Using Data and Documents in Investigative Reporting". Description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet talks about combining data and documents with human sources, so I'll mention that.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking at the content: "data journalism", "document analysis", "FOIA", "investigative techniques", and "public records" seem relevant.

I should structure all this into a JSON object with the specified keys. Make sure not to make up any names, so if there's no email or affiliation, leave them null.
