Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each requirement step by step.

First, the id is T2614 as specified. The authors section requires a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. From the input, I see Matthew Waite is listed as the staff writer from St. Petersburg Times, and his email is waite@sptimes.com. So, that's straightforward.

The conference is NICAR since it mentions "NICAR National Conference" in Newark, NJ, March 9-12, 2006. The year is clearly 2006.

For the title, it says "Mapping for the web," so I'll use that exactly. 

The description needs to be a concise summary of the text. The tipsheet discusses various options for putting maps on the web, each with pros and cons. So, my summary should reflect that it's an overview of these tools.

Keywords are next. They must be no more than five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking at the content, "mapping," "web mapping tools," "GIS," "ArcIMS," and "MapServer" seem appropriate.

I need to ensure all keys and values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, I should avoid any markdown formatting as per the instructions.

Let me double-check each part: id, authors with their details, conference type, year, title, description, and keywords. Everything seems covered.
