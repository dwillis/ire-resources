Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors conference. Let me go through this step by step.

First, the user wants specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 3088. 

Looking at the input, the authors are listed as Shannon Cake, Jim Sitton, and Dave Peterson-WPTV-West Palm Beach, FL. Since their emails aren't provided, I'll set email to null for each. Their affiliation seems to be WPTV since that's mentioned with West Palm Beach, so I'll use that.

The conference isn't explicitly stated as IRE, NICAR, or another, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed". Similarly, the year isn't provided in the text, so I'll set year to "Not Listed".

For the title, the tipsheet is titled “Bogus Billing, A Contact 5 Investigation”. The description should be a concise summary. From the input, the investigation focused on Medicare fraud affecting seniors, using their fears and the impact on future generations as motivation for whistleblowing.

Keywords are next. I'll extract relevant terms: Medicare Fraud, Senior Issues, Bogus Billing, Fraud Investigation, Public Benefits. These capture the essence without including the conference or authors.

Putting it all together, each field is populated with the correct data, ensuring proper formatting and structure in JSON.
