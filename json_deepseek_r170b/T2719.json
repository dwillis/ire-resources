Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user has provided a detailed tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters & Editors (IRE) conference. They want me to create a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, I need to identify the ID as T2719. That's straightforward. Next, looking at the authors, Eric Nalder is mentioned with his email and affiliation with the Seattle Times. There are other contributors like Steve Finley, but he doesn't have an affiliation listed, so I'll note that as null.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, and the year is 2000 based on the context provided. The title should be a concise summary of the tipsheet's content. For the description, it needs to be a brief summary in simple language, so I'll mention the investigation into ferry safety and the lack of life rafts.

Keywords are next. I'll pick relevant terms like "investigative journalism," "ferry safety," "life rafts," "Coast Guard regulations," and "passenger safety" to cover the main points without exceeding five terms.

I should ensure that all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, any missing information should be marked as null where appropriate.
