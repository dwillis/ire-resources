Alright, I need to create a JSON object from the given tipsheet. The user provided specific instructions on how to structure it with certain keys.

First, I'll identify each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. 

The id is straightforward; it's 5725_4 as specified.

Next, for the authors section, there's only one author mentioned: Tom Brune from Newsday. His email is provided, so I'll include that along with his affiliation as Newsday. Since there are no other authors listed, the array will have just one object.

The conference location is Orlando, Florida, and it's an IRE Annual Conference, so the conference key should be "IRE".

The year is clearly stated as 2018, so that's easy to fill in.

The title of the tipsheet is given as "Tracking Legislation in Congress from Outside the Beltway", which I'll use directly.

For the description, it needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet focuses on how to track legislation using various websites and tools, especially for reporters not based in Washington D.C. So I'll phrase that into a couple of clear sentences.

Keywords are next. I should pick up to five relevant terms. The main topics here are tracking legislation, Congress, reporting tools, and investigative journalism. Those seem appropriate and cover the content without including the conference or authors.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, there's no need for any made-up names; just use what's provided. 

Finally, I'll structure everything into a JSON object, making sure each key is correctly formatted and that the overall syntax is valid.
