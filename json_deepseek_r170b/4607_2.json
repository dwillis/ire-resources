Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided input using specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, the id should be "4607_2". 

Looking at the text, there are no authors mentioned, so the authors list will consist of an object with null for name, email, and affiliation.

The conference isn't specified in the input, so I'll set it to "Not Listed".

There's also no year provided, so that field will be "Not Listed" as well.

For the title, since the text is about police records retention schedules, I'll use a descriptive title like "Police Records Retention Schedules and Internal Investigations".

The description needs to be a concise summary. It should mention the types of documents covered and their management, so something like: "This document outlines the retention schedules for various police records including internal affairs investigations, mutual aid agreements, and officer activity logs."

Finally, keywords should include terms relevant to the content but exclude conference names or authors. So I'll choose: ["police", "records", "retention", "internal affairs", "investigations"].

Putting it all together, I need to structure this into a JSON object with proper syntax and enclosures.

```json
{
  "id": "4607_2",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Police Records Retention Schedules and Internal Investigations",
  "description": "This document outlines the retention schedules for various police records, including internal affairs investigations, mutual aid agreements, and officer activity logs.",
  "keywords": ["police", "records", "retention", "internal affairs", "investigations"]
}
```
