Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the id is given as 2939. That's straightforward. Next are the authors. The document lists Mark Greenblatt and Keith Tomshe, both from KHOU-TV in Houston. Since their emails aren't provided, I'll leave those fields null. Their affiliation is clearly stated as KHOU-TV (CBS, Houston), so that goes into the affiliation field.

The conference is mentioned as IRE, Phoenix 2007, so the conference key will be "IRE" and the year is 2007. The title of the tipsheet is "Visualizing the Data," which I can extract from the heading.

For the description, it's a 1-2 sentence summary. The main idea is about effectively communicating data findings through visuals rather than just numbers, so I'll craft a concise sentence that captures that essence.

Keywords are next. They should be no more than five terms and exclude the conference name and authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords might include "data visualization," "storytelling," "journalism tools," "graphics," and "audience engagement."

Putting it all together, I structure each part into the JSON format, ensuring that all keys and values are properly enclosed in quotes and that the syntax is correct.
