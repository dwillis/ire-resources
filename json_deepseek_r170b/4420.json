Alright, I need to create a JSON object from the provided tipsheet for an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference session titled "Wrangling federal campaign finance data in a ‘real’ newsroom." 

First, the `id` is given as 4420. Next, under `authors`, there are two presenters: Jacob Fenton, presenting as Chris Schnaars. Their emails and affiliations aren't provided, so those fields will be null.

The conference is clearly IRE, so that's set. The year isn't explicitly mentioned, so it defaults to "Not Listed." 

For the `description`, I need a concise summary of the session. It covers handling federal campaign finance data, sources like FEC and CRP, tools, APIs, and real-time tracking.

Keywords should include terms like "campaign finance," "FEC," "data journalism," "real-time data," and "APIs" to capture the essence without including the conference or authors' names.

Putting it all together, I structure each key accordingly, ensuring proper formatting and English language use.

  "id": 4420,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Wrangling federal campaign finance data in a 'real' newsroom",
  "description": "This session provides tips and resources for working with federal campaign finance data, including real-time tracking, FEC filings, and tools like CRP and APIs.",
  "keywords": [
    "campaign finance",
    "FEC",
    "data journalism",
    "real-time data",
    "APIs"
  ]
}
