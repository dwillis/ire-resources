Okay, I need to create a JSON object from the given input based on specific instructions. Let me start by understanding what each part requires.

First, the id should be 4059. Got that.

Next, the authors are listed as Matt Jacob and Alex Richards. Their affiliations are The Dallas Morning News and Chicago Tribune respectively. There's no email provided for either, so I'll set email to null for both.

The conference is NICAR 2014, so the year is 2014. The title isn't explicitly given but from the slides, it seems to be about disaster reporting tips, so I'll go with "Disaster Reporting Tipsheet".

For the description, it needs a concise summary. Looking through the content, they cover bridges, dams, chemical safety, weather events, etc., so summarizing that into one or two sentences.

Keywords should include terms like bridges, dams, chemical safety, disasters, data journalism, but limited to five. I'll choose the most relevant ones: bridges, dams, chemical safety, disasters, and data journalism.

I have to ensure all keys are in English and properly quoted. No made-up names; since emails aren't provided, they stay null. Affiliations come from their respective news organizations.

Putting it all together, the JSON structure should be correct with each field as specified.
