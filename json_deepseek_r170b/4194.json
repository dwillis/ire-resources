Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has provided specific instructions on how each part of the JSON should be structured.

First, let me parse through the input text. The title is "Building reporter-editor chemistry" by Alexandra Zayas and Chris Davis from the Tampa Bay Times, presented at IRE 2014. 

I need to assign an id, which is given as 4194. That's straightforward.

Next, for the authors array, each entry should have name, email, and affiliation. The names are Alexandra Zayas and Chris Davis. Since there are no emails provided in the text, those will be null. Their affiliation is the Tampa Bay Times, so that goes into the affiliation field for both authors.

The conference is clearly IRE because it's mentioned as IRE 2104, though I think that might be a typo and should be 2014. But regardless, it's an IRE event, so the conference key will be "IRE".

The year is listed as part of the conference identifier, which is IRE 2104. Wait, 2104 doesn't make senseâ€”it must be a typo. The actual year is likely 2014 since that makes more sense in context.

For the title, it's exactly as given: "Building reporter-editor chemistry".

The description needs to be a concise summary of the text. The tipsheet talks about mutual expectations between reporters and editors, emphasizing trust, initiative, self-awareness, feedback, and pushing each other to improve. So I can condense that into a sentence or two.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference names and authors. From the content, relevant keywords could be "reporter-editor relationship", "trust", "mutual respect", "feedback", and "story improvement".

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part as per the instructions, ensuring that nulls are used where information isn't available, like emails here.

I should double-check to make sure I haven't missed any details or misassigned any values. Once everything looks right, I can format it into a JSON object with proper syntax.
