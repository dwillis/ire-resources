Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to create this JSON object based on the user's query and the provided tipsheet. Let me go through it step by step.

First, the user has given a detailed tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference about finding international data. The author listed is Jonathan Stoneman. I need to structure this into a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The id should be "4766_1" as per the user's instruction. For the authors array, each entry needs name, email, and affiliation. Since only Jonathan Stoneman is mentioned without any email or affiliation, I'll set his name and leave email and affiliation as null. I can't make up information, so that's straightforward.

Next, the conference key. Looking at the content, it mentions IRE conferences, so the value here should be "IRE".

The year isn't specified in the provided text, so according to the instructions, I'll set it to "Not Listed".

For the title, the tipsheet is about finding international data, so a suitable title would be "Finding International Data."

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers using Google search techniques, TLDs, file types, open data portals, and social media for investigative reporting. So I'll craft a 1-2 sentence summary that captures these elements.

Keywords should be no more than five terms excluding the conference or authors. From the content, relevant keywords are "Google search techniques," "TLDs," "filetype," "open data portals," and "social media." These accurately represent the main topics covered.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly quoted. No markdown is allowed, so just plain JSON structure.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each key accordingly, making sure to follow the specified format without any additional text or formatting beyond the JSON object.

```json
{
  "id": "4766_1",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Finding International Data",
  "description": "A tipsheet providing strategies and resources for finding international data using Google search techniques, TLDs, file types, open data portals, and social media.",
  "keywords": [
    "Google search techniques",
    "TLDs",
    "filetype",
    "open data portals",
    "social media"
  ]
}
```
