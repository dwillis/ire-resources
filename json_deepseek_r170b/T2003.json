Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's instructions. The input provided is about using CAR (Computer-Assisted Reporting) in small newsrooms, presented at an IRE conference. 

First, I'll identify the id as T2003 since that's specified. Next, I look for authors. Jennie Coughlin is mentioned with her email and affiliation as The News Leader. There are no other authors listed, so the list has one entry.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that goes in the conference field. The year isn't provided, so it's "Not Listed". 

For the title, the main topic is CAR in small newsrooms, which is straightforward. The description should be a concise summary. I'll mention the strategies and challenges discussed to make it clear.

Keywords need to be relevant and no more than five. I pick "CAR", "small newsrooms", "data journalism", "local reporting", and "time management" as they cover the main points without including the conference or author names.

I also check that all values are in English and properly quoted, ensuring the structure meets the user's requirements.
