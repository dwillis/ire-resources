Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conferences. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, looking at the input, the tipsheet is titled "Consumer Investigations Resources" by Myriam Masihy. The id should be 5174 as specified. 

For the authors section, it's a list of elements with name, email, and affiliation. Since only Myriam Masihy is mentioned without any email or affiliation, I'll set her name and leave email and affiliation as null.

The conference is clearly stated to be IRE, so that key will be "IRE". The year isn't provided in the text, so it should be "Not Listed".

The title is straightforward: "Consumer Investigations Resources".

Now, the description needs to be a concise 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet provides strategies for building a consumer investigative unit, including engaging with the community, using databases, and filing FOIA requests. So I'll craft a simple sentence that captures this essence.

For keywords, they should exclude the conference and authors. Relevant terms from the content include "consumer investigations", "FOIA requests", "public records", "community engagement", and "databases". I'll list these as keywords, making sure not to exceed five terms.

I also need to ensure all keys and values are in English and enclosed in quotes. No made-up information should be added; if details aren't present, they stay null or "Not Listed".

Putting it all together, the JSON structure will have each key with appropriate values based on the given data.

    }
  ],
