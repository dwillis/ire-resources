Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down what's required.

First, the id is given as 4345, so that's straightforward. Next, the authors are listed with their names, emails, and affiliations. Looking at the panelists: Jaeah Lee, Kaeti Hinck, Aaron Williams. I don't see any emails provided, so those will be null. Affiliations aren't explicitly mentioned next to their names, but since they're part of a journalism conference, perhaps their Twitter handles can indicate their work. Alternatively, if their affiliations are known from general knowledge, like Jaeah Lee being affiliated with Mother Jones and others, I should include that.

The conference is clearly labeled as an IRE event, so the conference key will be "IRE". The year isn't provided in the session description, so it'll default to "Not Listed".

For the title, it's given as "Visual Journalism for Tiny Desks". The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers tools for data visualization, mapping, surveys, and interactive storytelling, so I'll phrase that into 1-2 sentences.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking through the content, relevant keywords could be "data visualization", "mapping tools", "interactive journalism", "news applications", and "survey tools".

I also need to ensure all values are in English and properly quoted. Since there's no year listed, it remains as "Not Listed". Each author entry gets their name, null for email, and affiliation if known or inferred.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, making sure each key is correctly formatted.
