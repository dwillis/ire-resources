Okay, so I need to help create a JSON object from the given tipsheet data. Let me start by understanding what's being asked.

First, the user provided a detailed tipsheet titled "DATA FOR BREAKING NEWS" which includes various sections like DO, USE, KNOW, PRACTICE, BUILD. Each section has bullet points with specific actions or considerations for journalists handling breaking news. 

The task is to convert this into a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id should be "4744_1". Authors is a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. Since the tipsheet doesn't mention any authors, the authors array will have elements with null for name, email, and affiliation.

Conference needs to be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". The given text is from an IRE conference, so that's clear.

Year isn't specified here, so it should default to "Not Listed".

Title is straightforward: "DATA FOR BREAKING NEWS TIPSHEET".

Description must be a concise summary. It should mention the tipsheet providing strategies for journalists covering breaking news, emphasizing preparedness and using data effectively.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference and authors. So I'll extract relevant terms like "breaking news", "data journalism", "preparedness", etc.

Now, structuring all this into JSON format with proper syntax, ensuring all keys and values are in quotes.

```json
{
  "id": "4744_1",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "DATA FOR BREAKING NEWS TIPSHEET",
  "description": "A tipsheet providing strategies and considerations for journalists covering breaking news, emphasizing preparedness, creative thinking, and effective use of data.",
  "keywords": [
    "breaking news",
    "data journalism",
    "preparedness",
    "investigative reporting",
    "creative thinking"
  ]
}
```
