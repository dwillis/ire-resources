Alright, I need to help this user by creating a JSON object from their provided tip sheet. Let me start by understanding what they're asking for.

First, they mentioned it's from the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference in June 2021. The title is "Crime in 2021: Statistics and Beyond," authored by Ted Gest from Criminal Justice Journalists. There are several references listed, but I only need to focus on the authors part.

They want an id of 6040. That's straightforward. Next, the authors section should be a list with each author having name, email, and affiliation. Ted Gest is the main author here. His email isn't provided in the text, so it'll be null. His affiliation is Criminal Justice Journalists, which I can include.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE 2021, so that's set. The year is 2021 since the event was in June of that year. For the title, it's exactly as given: "Crime in 2021: Statistics and Beyond."

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The tip sheet covers crime statistics sources like FBI UCR and NIBRS, so I'll mention those and how they help journalists report on crime accurately.

Keywords should include up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. I'll go with "crime statistics," "FBI UCR," "NIBRS," "criminal justice reporting," and "data sources." These cover the main topics.

Putting it all together, I structure the JSON with each key as specified. Making sure everything is in English and properly quoted without any markdown.
