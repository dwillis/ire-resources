Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from the IRE 2004 Conference. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the structure requires specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is already provided as T2130. 

Looking at the authors section, Derek Willis is listed with his affiliation as the Center for Public Integrity. There's no email mentioned, so I'll leave that null.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE 2004, so I'll set that with the year 2004. The title of the tipsheet is "State and Local Campaign Finance."

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet discusses tracking state party finances post-soft money ban, Levin funds, local parties opening federal accounts, new soft money sources, and story suggestions. So I'll condense that into 1-2 sentences.

Keywords should be no more than five terms excluding conference and authors. Relevant keywords here are "campaign finance," "state parties," "Levin funds," "local parties," and "soft money."

Putting it all together, each key is properly filled with the extracted information.
