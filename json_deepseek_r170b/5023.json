Alright, so I have this problem where I need to create a JSON object from some input data. The user has provided specific instructions on what each key should contain. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the id is straightforwardâ€”it's given as 5023. That part is easy.

Next, the authors are a list, and each author has name, email, and affiliation. The user mentioned not to make up names; if none are listed, leave them as null. Also, emails and affiliations can be null. If the text includes a news organization's name, use that as the affiliation if it's not explicitly provided next to the author's name.

Looking at the input data, I don't see any specific authors mentioned. So each author entry in the list should have "name": null, and since there are no emails or affiliations provided, those will also be null.

Moving on to conference: the user specified it can be "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Since the input doesn't mention a conference, I'll set this as "Not Listed".

The year is next. The user says if the event's year isn't clearly identified, it should be "Not Listed". Again, the input doesn't provide a specific year, so I'll go with that.

The description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. The input data provided seems to be about parsing city and state without delimiters, but since there's no actual text describing an event or something, I might need to adjust this. Perhaps the user intended to use a different input, so I'll note that and proceed with a default description.

Keywords are up to five terms, excluding conference and authors. Since the input is about parsing city and state data without delimiters, relevant keywords could be "data parsing", "city-state separation", " LEN function", etc. But since I need to exclude conference and authors, I'll focus on the technical aspects mentioned in the initial problem.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part according to these observations.

```json
{
  "id": 5023,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "description": "A method for parsing city and state data when not delimited.",
  "keywords": [
    "data parsing",
    "city-state separation"
  ]
}
```
