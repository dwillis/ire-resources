Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's instructions from the provided tipsheet. Let me go through this step by step.

First, the id should be 5310 as specified. Next, looking at the authors section: Sharon Machlis is mentioned at the top of the document. Her email and affiliation aren't listed here, so those will remain null.

The conference is clearly an IRE event because it's titled "Watchdog Workshop in Portland, Maine" from IRE. So the conference field is "IRE". The year is given as 2017 in the date October 13, 2017.

For the title, the document starts with "Tools Presented at the Oct. 14 IRE Watchdog Workshop in Portland, Maine", so that's the title.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers various tools for data journalism, including tracking information, data extraction, visualization, etc. So I'll write something like: "A tipsheet summarizing tools and resources presented at the IRE Watchdog Workshop, covering data tracking, extraction, wrangling, visualization, and analysis."

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. The main topics are data visualization, web scraping, data wrangling, tools for journalists, and R programming.

Putting it all together, ensuring each key is in quotes and proper formatting.
