Okay, so I need to help create a JSON object based on some given instructions and an input that seems to describe an Excel tutorial. The user provided a detailed guide on using Excel for data handling, covering topics like sorting, filtering, basic functions such as SUM, AVERAGE, and MEDIAN, and even touched on pivot tables.

First, I'll go through the requirements step by step to make sure I understand what needs to be done.

The JSON object should have the following keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. Each of these has specific instructions:

- **id**: Should be 4800.
- **authors**: A list where each element has name, email, and affiliation. I shouldn't make up names; if none are listed, leave them as null. Emails and affiliations can be null too. If a news organization is mentioned, use that as the affiliation if there's no explicit one provided.
- **conference**: It should be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed".
- **year**: The event year if clearly stated; otherwise, it's "Not Listed".
- **description**: A 1-2 sentence summary in simple language.
- **keywords**: Up to five terms excluding the conference and authors.

Now, looking at the input text provided. It's an Excel tutorial that doesn't mention any specific conference, authors, or year. The content is instructional, covering Excel functions, so I don't see any names of people or organizations mentioned. 

So breaking it down:

- **id**: 4800 is straightforward.
- **authors**: Since no authors are listed in the input, each entry should have name as null, and email and affiliation also null.
- **conference**: The text doesn't mention IRE, NICAR, or any other conference, so this would be "Not Listed".
- **year**: There's no specific year mentioned, so it's "Not Listed".
- **title**: The input is titled "Excel 101" as per the initial part of the user's message.
- **description**: Needs to be a short summary. The tutorial covers Excel basics like sorting, filtering, and functions such as SUM, AVERAGE, etc. So the description could be something like, "A basic guide to using Excel for data handling including sorting, filtering, and common mathematical functions."
- **keywords**: I need up to five terms. From the content, keywords could include "Excel", "sorting", "filtering", "SUM function", "data analysis".

Wait, but the instruction says to exclude the conference and authors from keywords, which in this case aren't present anyway. So those are appropriate.

Putting it all together:

- id: 4800
- authors: A list with one entry since no specific authors are mentioned. Each author object would have name, email, affiliation as null.
- conference: "Not Listed"
- year: "Not Listed"
- title: "Excel 101"
- description: A concise summary of the content.
- keywords: The relevant terms from above.

I think that's all. Now I can structure this into a JSON object as per the instructions.

```json
{
  "id": 4800,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Excel 101",
  "description": "A basic guide to using Excel for data handling including sorting, filtering, and common mathematical functions.",
  "keywords": [
    "Excel",
    "sorting",
    "filtering",
    "SUM function",
    "data analysis"
  ]
}
```
