Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has provided specific instructions, so let's break it down step by step.

First, the id is given as 3585, so that's straightforward. Next, I have to handle the authors section. The authors mentioned are James V. Grimaldi, David Fallis, Cheryl Thompson, Sari Horwitz, and Sarah Cohen. However, not all of them have emails or affiliations listed. Since the user said not to make up any names and to leave fields null if unknown, I'll set email and affiliation to null for each author.

The conference is clearly identified as "IRE" because it's from an IRE event. The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the text, so according to the instructions, it should be "Not Listed".

For the title, the main heading is "Tracking guns: How to investigate gun dealers and track murder weapons", which is perfect.

The description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary. Looking at the content, it's about investigating illegal gun trafficking by analyzing data on gun traces, so I'll condense that into a concise statement.

Keywords are next. The text covers topics like gun dealers, ATF, NRA, gun trafficking, and Tiahrt Amendment. I'll list these as keywords, making sure not to exceed five terms.

Putting it all together, each part is addressed according to the instructions, ensuring correct data types and handling missing information appropriately.
