Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conferences. Let's break down the query and figure out each part.

First, the user provided a detailed tipsheet titled "Digging up secrets and story ideas in bankruptcy court records" by Katy Stech from The Wall Street Journal. My task is to convert this into a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The ID is given as 4864, so that's straightforward. 

Next, the authors section. It should be a list where each element has name, email, and affiliation. The tipsheet mentions Katy Stech, but there's no email provided, so email will be null. Her affiliation is The Wall Street Journal, which I can extract from the byline.

Conference needs to be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Since this document doesn't specify the conference, but it's about investigative reporting, and considering Katy Stech's work, it's likely from an IRE event. So I'll set conference as "IRE".

The year isn't mentioned in the text, so that will be "Not Listed".

For the title, it's directly given: "Digging up secrets and story ideas in bankruptcy court records".

The description must be a concise 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet explains how to find stories using bankruptcy records, so I'll craft a simple summary around that.

Keywords should be no more than five terms, excluding the conference and authors. The main topics are bankruptcy records, Pacer.gov, financial journalism, investigative reporting, and court documents.

Putting it all together, ensuring each key is correctly filled with appropriate values, handling nulls where necessary, and keeping everything in English as per instructions.
