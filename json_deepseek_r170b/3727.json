Alright, I'm looking at this user query where they want me to generate a JSON object based on an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The id is given as 3727, so that's straightforward.

First, I need to parse the input data provided. It mentions IRE 2012 in Boston with the title "BROADCAST: DOING IT FOR FREE" by Aaron Wische from KNXV-TV ABC15 Phoenix. So, for the authors section, Aaron's name is there, but no email or affiliation beyond his station, which becomes his affiliation.

Next, the conference is clearly IRE, and the year is 2012 since it's specified as IRE 2012. The title is "BROADCAST: DOING IT FOR FREE". 

The description needs to be a concise summary of the content. The tipsheet talks about cost-saving strategies for broadcast journalists, so I'll phrase that into a clear sentence.

Keywords are important and should be no more than five, excluding the conference name and authors. Terms like "cost-effective reporting", "travel tips", "budget management", "journalism resources", and "investigative journalism" fit well here.

I also need to ensure all keys are in quotes and that the structure is correct without any markdown. The user emphasized only producing a JSON object, so I have to stick strictly to that format.

Finally, double-checking everything: authors with Aaron's details, correct conference info, proper summary, and relevant keywords. Everything seems in order.
