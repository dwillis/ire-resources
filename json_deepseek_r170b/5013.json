Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given me specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, the id is fixed at 5013. Next, authors is a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. Looking through the tipsheet, I see mentions of BuzzFeed, but no specific author names are listed. So, the name will be null, email null, and affiliation as "BuzzFeed".

The conference is NICAR because the URL includes nicar2017, which refers to the 2017 NICAR conference.

For the year, since it's 2017, that's straightforward.

The title should be "Mining the Social Web," as that's the heading in the tipsheet.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about using social media data for journalism, covering why it's useful and how to collect it. So, I'll write something like: "Tips on using social media data for investigative reporting, including tools and methods."

Keywords are next. From the content, relevant terms are social media data, investigative reporting, data collection, NICAR, and BuzzFeed. But wait, the user said not to include conference or authors in keywords, so I'll exclude NICAR and BuzzFeed. That leaves me with three keywords: social media data, investigative journalism, and data tools.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, each key should be correctly formatted without any markdown. 

So putting it all together, the JSON object will have id 5013, authors list with one entry (BuzzFeed), conference as NICAR, year 2017, title, description, and keywords as specified.

```json

  "id": 5013,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "BuzzFeed"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": 2017,
  "title": "Mining the Social Web",
  "description": "Tips on using social media data for investigative reporting, including tools and methods.",
  "keywords": [
    "social media data",
    "investigative journalism",
    "data collection"
  ]
}
```
