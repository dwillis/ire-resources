Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down what's required step by step.

First, I'll look at the structure of the input. The user provided a detailed tipsheet titled "Break It Down" presented by Robert Gebeloff at an IRE Watchdog Workshop in 2014. My task is to extract specific information and format it into a JSON object with keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

Starting with the `id`, it's given as 4026. That part is straightforward.

Next, for `authors`, I need a list where each element has `name`, `email`, and `affiliation`. The tipsheet only mentions Robert Gebeloff. Since thereâ€™s no email or affiliation provided, those fields will be null.

The `conference` key should reflect the event. In this case, it's clearly an IRE Watchdog Workshop, so conference is "IRE".

The `year` is listed as 2014, which is extracted from the date provided in the tipsheet.

For the `title`, the tipsheet is titled "Break It Down: How to dig deep into your dataset to report stories."

Now, the `description` needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet focuses on methods for analyzing datasets, specifically looking at poor, uninsured Americans under ACA using data from sources like SHADAC and Census microdata. So, I'll summarize that it provides a methodological approach to analyze healthcare data.

Finally, `keywords` should include relevant terms up to five. The key elements here are data-driven reporting, healthcare, ACA (Obamacare), dataset analysis, and investigative journalism.

Putting it all together, each part is mapped correctly into the JSON structure as per the instructions.
