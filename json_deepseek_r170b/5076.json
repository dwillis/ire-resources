Alright, I need to create a JSON object from the given tipsheet about using EMMA for reporters. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the ID is provided as 5076, so that's straightforward. Next, looking at the authors section: the text mentions the MSRB and provides an email but no specific author names. Since there are no individual authors listed, I'll set name to null for both entries. The affiliation will be "Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB)" based on the contact information given.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE" since it's from Investigative Reporters and Editors conferences. The year isn't explicitly mentioned, so I'll default that to "Not Listed". 

For the title, the document is titled "REPORTER’S GUIDE TO USING EMMA", which I'll use directly. The description needs a concise summary: EMMA offers free access to financial documents for state/local governments and entities like hospitals and universities, useful for journalists covering various beats.

Keywords should be up to five relevant terms. From the text, "EMMA", "financial documents", "municipal bonds", "investigative reporting", and "public debt" are all key topics.

I'll structure everything in JSON with proper formatting and ensure all values are enclosed in quotes as specified.
