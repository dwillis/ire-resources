Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an IRE conference. Let's go through each step carefully.

First, the id should be 5105 as specified. The authors are Harvey Cashore and Kathryn Gretsinger. Their emails and affiliations are given: Harvey is with CBC The Fifth Estate and Kathryn with UBC Graduate School of Journalism. So I'll list them under authors with their respective details.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE" since the document starts with "IRE CONFERENCE." The year is May 2017, so that goes into the year field.

For the title, the main heading after the conference info is "Questions & Answers" by Harvey Cashore and Kathryn Gretsinger. So I'll use that as the title.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers interviewing techniques, emphasizing listening, types of interviews (INPUT vs OUTPUT), question strategies, and key considerations like tone and follow-ups. So I'll condense that into 1-2 sentences focusing on effective interviewing for information gathering and storytelling.

Keywords should include the main topics: interviewing techniques, accountability, emotional impact, narrative interviewing, active listening. These are all relevant terms from the content without including the conference or authors' names.

Putting it all together, each field is filled with the extracted information, ensuring proper formatting and structure as per the instructions.
