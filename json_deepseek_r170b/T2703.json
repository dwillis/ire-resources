Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's instructions. The input provided seems to be tips for broadcast investigations, covering various topics like government records, court documents, campaign finance, etc.

First, the id should be T2703 as specified. 

Looking at authors, there are no names mentioned in the text, so I'll set name to null. Email and affiliation can also be null since there's no information provided about them. If there were a news organization mentioned, it would go into affiliation, but here, nothing is present.

The conference is "IRE" because the text mentions utilizing the IRE Resource Library and attending conferences. 

For the year, I don't see any specific mention of the event date, so it should be "Not Listed".

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary in simple language. The tips cover using online resources, databases, and techniques for investigating government activities. So, summarizing that into one or two sentences makes sense.

Keywords are next. I need up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the content, "Broadcast Investigations", "Government Records", "Court Documents", "Campaign Finance", and "Investigative Reporting" seem relevant.

Putting it all together, I structure the JSON with each key appropriately filled based on the instructions.

Here is the JSON object based on the input:

```json
{
  "id": "T2703",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Broadcast Investigations Tips and Resources",
  "description": "A guide to investigative reporting techniques, resources, and strategies for broadcast journalists covering government beats.",
  "keywords": [
    "Broadcast Investigations",
    "Government Records",
    "Court Documents",
    "Campaign Finance",
    "Investigative Reporting"
  ]
}
```
