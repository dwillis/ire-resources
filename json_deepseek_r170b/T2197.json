Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to respond to this user query. They want me to produce a JSON object that describes a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The response should only include the JSON object without any additional text or explanation.

Looking at their input, it's pretty detailed. They provided a lot of information about a specific session from IRE's 2004 Regional Conference in Las Vegas. The speaker is Jim Parsons from WTAE TV/Hearst-Argyle Television, and there are several tips listed on how to build an investigative brand daily.

First, I need to structure the JSON with the required keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The ID should be T2197 as specified. 

For the authors section, it's a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. Jim Parsons is listed, so his name will be included. His email is provided (jparsons@hearst.com), and since he's affiliated with WTAE TV/Hearst-Argyle Television, that becomes his affiliation.

The conference is clearly IRE, and the year is 2004 as given in the input. The title of the session is "BUILDING THE INVESTIGATIVE BRAND ON A DAILY BASIS."

The description needs to be a concise summary of one or two sentences. The tipsheet talks about adapting investigative reporting to daily pressures due to changes in ratings systems, so I'll phrase it around that.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords would be "investigative journalism," "daily reporting," "ratings pressure," "story development," and "newsroom collaboration."

Now, I need to ensure all these elements are correctly formatted in JSON. Each key is enclosed in quotes, and the structure follows the specified requirements. No additional information should be included beyond the JSON object.

I think that covers everything the user asked for. Time to put it all together.
