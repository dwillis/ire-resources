Alright, so I'm trying to create this JSON object based on the user's query. Let me see what they provided. They want me to take the input about building sources from an investigative reporters conference and structure it into a specific JSON format with certain keys.

First off, the ID is given as 5565. That’s straightforward. Next, authors need to be a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. The user mentioned Jenifer McKim and her contact info: jenifer.mckim@necir.org and @jbmckim. So I can fill that in. Her affiliation is NECIR since it's listed as the organization.

The conference is either IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed. Since the input doesn't specify which conference it was from, I'll go with "Not Listed". The year is also not provided, so that will be "Not Listed" too.

For the title and description, the main focus of the tipsheet is about building sources, gaining trust, and effective interviewing techniques. So the title should reflect that, maybe "Building Sources". The description needs to be a concise summary—perhaps something like how reporters can build relationships with sources, including victims and whistleblowers, through trust and persistence.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Relevant keywords might include "source building", "journalism", "interview techniques", "trust", and "investigative reporting". I'll list those in order.

I need to make sure all the keys are present: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. Each part of the authors' data should be filled correctly without making up any information. If something's missing, like other authors or specific years, it should stay as null or "Not Listed".

Putting it all together, I structure each key with its corresponding value, ensuring proper JSON syntax with quotes and commas in the right places.
