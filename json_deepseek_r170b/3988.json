Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet regarding shell companies and fraud. The user provided detailed information which I'll use to extract necessary data.

First, I'll identify each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 3988. 

Looking at the authors section, Kelly Carr is listed with her email and affiliation. There's another mention of Jason Sharman, but his details aren't provided except for a quote about U.S. incorporation laws. So I'll include him as an author without email or affiliation.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, and the year is 2013 since it's mentioned in the document. The title is "Shell Companies and Fraud: An Investigative Primer."

For the description, I need a concise summary. Shell companies are discussed as entities with no significant assets used for both legitimate purposes like trade secrets and illicit activities such as money laundering.

Keywords should be relevant terms from the content, excluding conference and authors. I'll choose shell companies, fraud, money laundering, corporate secrecy, and financial crime.

Now, I'll structure all this information into a JSON object, ensuring each key is correctly formatted with proper syntax and values enclosed in quotes.
