Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has specific instructions, so I should follow them carefully.

First, the id is given as 5125, so that's straightforward. Next, authors: looking at the input, Brad Racino is listed with his title and Twitter handle. There's no email provided, so email will be null. His affiliation is inewsource, which is a news organization, so I'll include that.

Conference should be "IRE" since it's from an IRE event. The year isn't mentioned anywhere, so I'll set it to "Not Listed". The title of the tipsheet is "Digging into nonprofits".

For the description, I need a 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet covers where to find 990 forms and other resources for investigating nonprofits, so that's the essence.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Relevant terms would be "nonprofits", "990s", "Guidestar.org", "CharityNavigator.org", and "CitizenAudit.org".

I should ensure all keys are in quotes, values are correctly formatted, and no extra information is added beyond what's provided.
