Alright, so I need to figure out how to create this JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down what's required step by step.

First, the user wants a JSON response with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as Tipsheet_4030. 

Looking at the tipsheet, the author information is provided at the top. Peter Aldhous is listed with his email and Twitter handle. Since there's no explicit affiliation mentioned beyond that, I can leave it null unless instructed otherwise. So, the authors array will have one object with name: "Peter Aldhous", email: "peter@peteraldhous.com", and affiliation: null.

The conference is NICAR 2014 in Baltimore, so the conference key should be "NICAR". The year is clearly 2014 since it's part of the event details. 

The title of the tipsheet seems to be about producing a map using QGIS, but looking at the content, the main focus is on the session where they created a JSON object from input with specific keys. So, I'll set the title accordingly.

For the description, it needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. The tipsheet involves creating a JSON object based on given specifications, including author details and conference information. So, summarizing that should suffice.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords would be "QGIS", "mapping", "data visualization", "JSON", and "tutorial". These capture the essence without including the conference or author names.

Putting it all together, I need to structure this information into a JSON object with proper syntax, ensuring all keys are in quotes and values are correctly formatted. Double-checking for any missing details or formatting issues is essential before finalizing.

```json
{
  "id": "Tipsheet_4030",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Peter Aldhous",
      "email": "peter@peteraldhous.com",
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": 2014,
  "title": "Producing a JSON Object from Input with Specific Keys",
  "description": "A session on creating a JSON object based on given specifications, including author details and conference information.",
  "keywords": [
    "QGIS",
    "mapping",
    "data visualization",
    "JSON",
    "tutorial"
  ]
}
```
