Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. The input provided is a detailed teaching guide for investigative reporting. Let me break down what needs to be done.

First, the structure of the JSON should include specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. Each key has its own requirements.

Starting with the "id" field. It's straightforward—just set it to "T2297".

Next is "authors". The user mentioned that if no names are listed, I should leave the name as null. In the provided text, there’s no author specified, so each entry in the authors list will have name, email, and affiliation all set to null.

Moving on to "conference". The options are "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Since the original text doesn't specify which conference it's from, I'll go with "Not Listed".

The "year" should be included if it's clearly mentioned. There’s no year provided in the input, so I'll set that to "Not Listed" as well.

For the "title", looking at the content, a suitable title would encapsulate the essence of the document. Something like "Teaching Investigative Reporting: Tips and Strategies" seems appropriate because it reflects the instructional nature of the text.

The "description" needs to be a concise summary in simple language. The document is about teaching methods for investigative journalism using internet resources, so I'll phrase it as such.

Lastly, "keywords". These should be relevant terms that capture the main ideas without including the conference or authors. From the content, terms like "investigative reporting", "journalism education", "internet research", "search strategies", and "government sources" fit well. I need to ensure there are no more than five keywords.

Putting it all together, each part is addressed step by step based on the user's instructions.
