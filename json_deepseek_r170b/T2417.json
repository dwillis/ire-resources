Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me break down what's required.

First, the user provided a detailed tipsheet from Gerry Lanosga of WTHR-Indianapolis. The task is to extract specific information into a structured JSON format with keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

Starting with the ID: it should be T2417 as per the instructions.

Next, the authors section needs a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. Gerry Lanosga is listed with his email and affiliation, so that's straightforward.

Conference is clearly stated as IRE National Conference in Denver, 2005. So conference key will be "IRE" and year is 2005.

The title of the tipsheet is given: "The Abuse and Exploitation of Children: Overcoming the Confidentiality Barrier."

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about investigating child abuse despite confidentiality barriers, so I'll make sure that's clear in one or two sentences.

Keywords should be relevant and limited to five terms. I'll extract key themes like "child abuse", "confidentiality", "investigative reporting", "public records", and "transparency."

I have to ensure all values are in English and properly quoted. Also, avoid making up any data; if something's missing, leave it as null.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with each key correctly populated based on the extracted information.

    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2005,
  "title": "The Abuse and Exploitation of Children: Overcoming the Confidentiality Barrier",
  "description": "This tipsheet discusses strategies for investigating child abuse cases despite confidentiality barriers, including accessing state records, leveraging federal oversight documents, and using legal action to enforce transparency.",
  "keywords": ["child abuse", "confidentiality", "investigative reporting", "public records", "transparency"]
