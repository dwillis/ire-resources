Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me break down what's required.

First, the structure needs to include specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is provided as 3621, so that's straightforward.

Looking at the input, I see two speakers: Elizabeth Lucas from the Center for Public Integrity and Kate Golden from the Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism. Their emails are also provided, so each author object will have name, email, and affiliation.

The conference mentioned in the header is NICAR February 2012, so I'll set the conference key to "NICAR" and the year to 2012. The title of the session is given as "Environmental analyses for any newsroom" with an alias "aka: beware of environmental data".

For the description, I need a concise summary in simple terms. The tipsheet seems to focus on using environmental data in journalism, mentioning sources like EPA databases and tools like ECHO. So, the description should capture that essence without getting too technical.

Keywords are next. I'll extract relevant terms related to the topic but exclude conference and author names. Looking through the content, keywords could be "environmental data", "EPA", "ECHO", "TRI", and "data analysis".

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, check that the JSON structure is valid with correct syntax.

Putting it all together, I'll map each part of the input to the required keys, making sure not to miss any details or make up information.
