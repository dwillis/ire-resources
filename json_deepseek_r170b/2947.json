Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me go through this step by step.

First, the id is given as 2947, so that's straightforward. 

Next, looking at the authors section. The speaker mentioned is Matt Goldberg from KNBC-TV. There's no other author listed, so the authors list will have one entry with his name, email, and affiliation. His email is provided as matt.goldberg@nbc.com, and since he's affiliated with KNBC-TV, that goes into the affiliation field.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE National Conference in Phoenix, Arizona, June 7-10, 2007. So the conference key will be "IRE" and the year is 2007.

For the title, the session is titled "USING THE WEB TO GET MILLIONS TO WATCH YOUR INVESTIGATION," so that's exactly what I'll use.

The description needs to be a concise summary of the content. The tipsheet talks about using online strategies like dedicated web pages and video clips on platforms such as YouTube to increase viewership. So, I'll summarize that into one or two sentences focusing on maximizing an investigation's audience through internet distribution.

Now, keywords. I need up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Key points from the tipsheet include "viral spread," "web pages," "video clips," "online promotion," and "investigative journalism." These capture the essence without overlapping with the main topics.

Putting it all together, each part is addressed and formatted correctly in JSON. I double-check to ensure all fields are enclosed in quotes and that the structure is valid.
