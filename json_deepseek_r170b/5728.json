Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user has provided some input that seems to be from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet about using animation in investigative reporting. My task is to create a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, I need to parse the information given. The ID is specified as 5728, so that's straightforward. Next, looking at the authors section, there are three people mentioned:

1. Hilke Schellmann with her email and affiliation (NYU).
2. Ryan Gabrielson with his email and affiliation (ProPublica).
3. Sam Ellis with his email and affiliation (Vox).

Each author should be an object in a list under "authors," each containing name, email, and affiliation. Since all names are provided, I don't need to leave any as null.

The conference is IRE, as indicated by the context provided. The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the text, so it should default to "Not Listed."

For the title, the tipsheet has a clear heading: "Bring your investigative reporting to life using animation." That's perfect for the title field.

The description needs to be a concise 1-2 sentence summary of the content. The tipsheet discusses turning investigations into explainers through research, writing, and production steps, so I'll summarize that process.

Keywords should be relevant and up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Terms like "animation," "investigative reporting," "explainer videos," "storytelling techniques," and "visual journalism" seem appropriate.

Putting it all together, I structure each part into the JSON format as per the instructions.
