Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on this query. The user provided a detailed set of instructions along with some text that seems like a list of tools and resources for digital journalists.

First, the id should be 5401 as specified. 

Next, authors: looking through the text, there's a mention of "Jeremy" but no other details, so name is null. Email and affiliation are also not provided, so they'll remain null. So the authors list will have one object with all nulls except for name being null.

Conference: The text mentions IRE and NICAR in some tool collections, but it's unclear if this specific resource was presented at either conference. Since it's not explicitly stated, I should set conference to "Not Listed".

Year: There's no clear year mentioned in the provided text, so year is also "Not Listed".

Title: The main heading seems to be about tools and resources for digital journalists, so the title will reflect that.

Description: It needs to be a brief summary. The text lists various tools, apps, and resources related to digital journalism, including data visualization, AR tricks, etc. So I'll summarize it as a collection of tools and resources for digital journalists covering multimedia, data, and more.

Keywords: From the content, relevant keywords are "digital journalism", "tools", "multimedia", "data visualization", and "resources". I need to keep it to five terms, excluding conference names and authors which aren't present here.

Putting it all together, each key is enclosed in quotes, and the structure follows as per the instructions.
