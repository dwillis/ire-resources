Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Peter Karl. Let me first read through the tipsheet carefully.

The tipsheet starts with "Get out of your chair and get onto the street!" which emphasizes hands-on investigation. It talks about using documents not just for legal protection but also to develop sources by humanizing stories. The author suggests going to crime scenes to verify details from reports, using phone books as a tool, avoiding manipulation of information, focusing on facts, and ensuring simplicity in storytelling.

It mentions that the best stories involve good vs. evil, with motives like sex, money, and ego. There's advice against complicating stories, avoiding minor mistakes, not assuming anything, preparing for target interviews, giving subjects a chance to talk, using diplomacy when dealing with police, not writing before the investigation is complete, and being cautious of information that seems too good.

The tipsheet ends with "IT’S NOT BECAUSE I AM SO SMART BUT BECAUSE THEY’RE SO STUPID."

Now, moving on to constructing the JSON object. The user wants specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

1. **id**: Should be T2743 as specified.
2. **authors**: A list where each element has name, email, and affiliation. Since Peter Karl is mentioned but no other details are provided, his email and affiliation will be null.
3. **conference**: The tipsheet mentions Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE), so the conference should be "IRE".
4. **year**: There's no specific year listed in the text, so it'll be "Not Listed".
5. **title**: The title given is "PETER KARL TIP SHEET".
6. **description**: A 1-2 sentence summary. It should capture the essence of the tipsheet, which is about effective investigative reporting techniques.
7. **keywords**: Up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Keywords could be "investigative reporting," "document use," "source development," "crime scene investigation," and "journalistic integrity."

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, avoid making up any information not provided.
