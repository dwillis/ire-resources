Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an IRE conference. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON.

First, I'll start by identifying the id as 3050, which is straightforward. Next, for the authors section, I see three panelists listed: Fred Schulte from The Sun, David Heath from The Seattle Times, and David McKie from CBC. Their contact information isn't needed since the user mentioned not to include emails or affiliations unless specified. So each author will have a name and null values for email and affiliation.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE Houston in 2008, so that's easy. The title of the tipsheet is "The health beat: drugs and doctors (E)". For the description, I need to summarize it in one or two sentences. It's about covering the health beat with a focus on pharmaceuticals and medical devices.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords could be "health journalism", "pharmaceutical industry", "medical devices", "drug safety", and "investigative reporting".

I need to ensure all keys are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. No markdown is allowed, so I'll make sure the JSON is clean and correctly formatted.
