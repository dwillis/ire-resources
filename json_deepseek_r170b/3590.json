Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conferences. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON, so I'll follow those closely.

First, the id is given as 3590, so that's straightforward. Next, authors: the original text doesn't list any specific names, emails, or affiliations, so each author object will have name as null and email and affiliation as null too.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that goes in the "conference" field. The year isn't mentioned anywhere in the text, so it'll be "Not Listed".

For the title, the tipsheet covers various web resources for investigative journalism, so a suitable title would be "Web Resources for Investigative Journalists."

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet provides links and tools useful for investigations, so I can write something like: "A collection of essential web resources and tools for investigative journalists covering topics such as crime, finance, weather, and more."

Keywords should be no more than five. Looking at the content, relevant keywords are "investigative journalism," "web resources," "research tools," "crime data," and "financial databases." I'll make sure these are in a list.

I also need to ensure all keys and values are in English and enclosed in quotes. Since there's no made-up information and everything is based on the provided text, that should cover it.
