Okay, I'm trying to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The input provided includes details about how databases were used during a disaster in Cedar Rapids. 

First, I need to extract the necessary information for each key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The ID is specified as 3192. That's straightforward.

For the authors section, I see Zack Kucharski listed with his email and affiliation. There might be more authors, but in this case, only Zack is mentioned. So I'll create an array with one object containing name, email, and affiliation.

The conference isn't explicitly stated, but given that it's from Investigative Reporters and Editors, the conference should be "IRE".

Looking for the year, the flood happened in 2008, so that will be the year of the event.

The title is clearly "Databases in a disaster".

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. I'll mention how databases helped during the Cedar Rapids flooding by providing information and aiding reporting efforts.

For keywords, I should pick relevant terms like 'databases', 'disaster response', 'floods', 'Cedar Rapids', and 'recovery' since they capture the essence without including the conference or authors.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly quoted. Also, make sure no extra information is added beyond what's provided.
