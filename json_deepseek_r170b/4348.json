Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors conference. The user provided specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, I see that the id is specified as 4348, so I'll set that. Next, looking at the authors section, only Joanna Lin is listed with her affiliation as Reveal / The Center for Investigative Reporting and a Twitter handle. There's no email provided, so I'll leave email null.

The conference mentioned is #NICAR15, which I know stands for the NICAR conference in 2015, so the year should be 2015. The title seems to be about watchdogging public spending, so I'll use that as the title.

For the description, it needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about analyzing salaries of county supervisors using data like population and standardized residuals, so I'll summarize that in one or two sentences.

Keywords should be relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, appropriate keywords might include public spending, government salaries, data analysis, linear regression, and investigative journalism.

I need to make sure all keys are enclosed in quotes and values are in English. Also, ensure that the JSON structure is correct without any markdown formatting.
