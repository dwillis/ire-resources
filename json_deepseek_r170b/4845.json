Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has provided specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with certain keys.

First, let's parse the input. The main content is titled "Constructing the Narrative: An Unbelievable Story of Rape" by Ken Armstrong from The Marshall Project. His contact info is also given. The tipsheet includes several points about narrative construction techniques like suspending the reader with unanswered questions, enabling the reader by embedding rules early on, surprising them through perspective shifts, avoiding nut graphs, using simple language, thinking cinematically, minding packaging, and portraying people in full.

Now, mapping this to the required JSON keys:

- **id**: Given as 4845.
- **authors**: A list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. Only Ken Armstrong is listed, so his details go here. Email and affiliation are present.
- **conference**: Since it's from IRE, that's the value.
- **year**: Not provided in the input, so "Not Listed".
- **title**: The title of the tipsheet.
- **description**: A 1-2 sentence summary. It should capture the essence of narrative techniques for engaging storytelling.
- **keywords**: Up to five relevant terms excluding conference and authors. Possible keywords: narrative construction, suspense, reader engagement, storytelling, investigative journalism.

I need to ensure all values are in English, keys are enclosed in quotes, and structure is correct without markdown.
