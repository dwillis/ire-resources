Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The input provided includes details from the Orlando Sentinel investigation into Florida private schools accepting vouchers.

First, I'll extract the necessary information: title is "Schools Without Rules," authors are Leslie Postal, Beth Kassab, and Annie Martin. Their affiliation is Orlando Sentinel since that's mentioned in the text.

The conference is IRE because the user specified it. The year isn't provided, so I'll set it to "Not Listed." 

For the description, a concise summary of their reporting methods and findings would work. They visited schools, used document requests, and organized data with tools like Google Docs.

Keywords should include terms like 'voucher schools,' 'investigative reporting,' 'document requests,' 'school accountability,' and 'private education.'

Now, I'll structure all this into a JSON object with the specified keys: id, authors (as an array of objects), conference, year, title, description, and keywords. Each author entry needs name, email, and affiliation, but emails aren't provided so they can be null.

Double-checking to ensure no made-up names are used and all details align with the input text.
