Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with certain keys.

First, let's identify each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

Starting with the id, it should be "CrackingCodes" as per the instruction. 

Next, for the authors section, I need a list of objects each containing name, email, and affiliation. The text mentions David Donald from The Center for Public Integrity. His email is provided, so that's straightforward. There are no other authors mentioned, so the list will only have him.

The conference is the 2013 CAR Conference in Louisville, KY. Since CAR is part of IRE, the conference key should be "IRE". 

The year is clearly listed as 2013, so that goes into the year field.

The title of the tipsheet is "Cracking the Codes".

For the description, it needs to be a concise summary. The text talks about using FOIA to access CMS data, overcoming legal challenges, and analyzing large datasets. So I'll phrase that into a 1-2 sentence summary focusing on these aspects.

Keywords should be up to five relevant terms excluding conference and authors. From the content, "FOIA", "CMS", "data analysis", "healthcare billing", and "Medicare" are appropriate.

I also need to ensure all values are in English and properly quoted. No markdown is allowed in the final response, just a clean JSON object.

Double-checking that I haven't missed any authors or misattributed affiliations. Since only David Donald is listed, that's covered.

Finally, structuring everything into the JSON format with proper syntax, ensuring commas are correctly placed and all keys are enclosed in quotes.
