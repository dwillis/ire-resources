Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided specific instructions, so I should follow them carefully.

First, I'll identify each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. 

The id is T2423 as specified. 

For the authors section, it's a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. The tipsheet lists Tisha Thompson from WMAR-TV in Baltimore. Her email is provided, so I'll include that. Since she works for WMAR-TV, that will be her affiliation.

The conference is clearly stated as the 2005 IRE National Conference in Denver, so the conference key should be "IRE" and the year is 2005.

The title of the tipsheet seems to be "SMALL MARKET OR SMALL STAFF? HOW TO STILL DO INVESTIGATIONS."

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet offers advice on how reporters in small markets or with limited staff can conduct investigative journalism through planning, resource management, and dedication.

For keywords, I should pick up to five relevant terms excluding conference and authors. Looking at the content, appropriate keywords could be "investigative reporting," "small market," "resource management," "FOIA," and "journalist tips."

I'll structure all of this into a JSON object, ensuring that each key is properly quoted and the values are correctly formatted. I need to make sure there are no markdown elements and everything is in English as per the instructions.

Double-checking the requirements: authors' details are correctly extracted, description is concise, keywords are relevant and within the limit. Everything seems in order.
