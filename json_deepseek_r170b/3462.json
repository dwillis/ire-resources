Alright, so I need to figure out how to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I'll start by identifying each required key for the JSON: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The ID is straightforward; it's 3462 as provided in the tipsheet number.

Next, looking at the authors section, there are two names mentioned: Wendell Cochran and MaryJo Webster. However, their emails and affiliations aren't listed. The instructions say not to make up any information, so both email and affiliation should be null for each author. Also, since they're part of the National Institute of Computer-Assisted Reporting (NICAR), which is part of IRE, that's useful info.

The conference field needs to be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Since this tipsheet is from a NICAR event, I'll set it to "NICAR".

For the year, the text clearly states March 2011 in Raleigh, NC. So, year should be 2011.

The title of the tipsheet is "GETTING INTO A ‘DATA STATE OF MIND’", so that's clear.

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about approaching stories with data in mind, using it as raw material to answer questions and provide insights. It also includes examples like where sex offenders can live or the impact of smoking bans on restaurants. So, summarizing this into 1-2 sentences: "This tipsheet emphasizes the importance of using data to drive investigative journalism by quantifying stories, answering questions, and providing insights through examples."

For keywords, I need up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords could be "data-driven journalism", "investigative reporting", "quantifying stories", "storytelling with data", and "journalistic techniques". These capture the essence without repeating the conference or authors.

Putting it all together, I structure each key accordingly, making sure strings are in quotes and proper formatting is maintained. Also, ensuring that no made-up information is included and only the provided details are used.
