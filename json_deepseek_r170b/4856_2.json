Okay, so I need to create a JSON object from the given input based on the user's instructions. Let me break down what they want.

First, the structure should have specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is provided as "4856_2". 

Looking at the input, the speaker is Jenifer McKim from The Eye, New England Center for Investigative Reporting. Her contact info includes email and phone, so I'll use that in the authors array. Since she's the only author mentioned, the list will have one object with her details.

The conference isn't explicitly stated, but since it's about investigative reporting and mentions IRE (Investigative Reporters and Editors), I can infer the conference is "IRE". 

The year isn't given in the input, so I'll set it to "Not Listed".

For the title, the main topic seems to be investigating child maltreatment, so that should work.

The description needs a concise summary. The tipsheet covers laws like CAPTA and FOIA strategies for reporting on child abuse cases. I'll phrase that clearly.

Keywords should include relevant terms: child abuse, FOIA, CAPTA, investigative journalism, and child welfare.

I also need to make sure all values are in English and properly quoted. No markdown, just the JSON structure as per the example.
