Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. Let me read through their instructions carefully.

The user provided details from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference in Fort Worth, 2006. The speaker is Tim Nostrand, who works at The Record. His presentation is about managing investigative stories, specifically how to handle selling the story to editors and maintaining trust.

First, I'll start by identifying the required keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The id should be T2722 as specified. 

For authors, there's only one author listedâ€”Tim Nostrand. His email is nostrand@northjersey.com, and his affiliation is The Record. So I'll create an array with a single object containing these details.

Conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's straightforward. The year is 2006 since the event took place in Fort Worth that year.

The title of the tipsheet is "Conceiving and managing the investigative story."

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The main points are managing stories, selling them to editors, and building trust through reliability. So I'll craft it into one or two sentences covering these aspects.

Keywords should include no more than five terms. From the content, relevant keywords would be "investigative journalism," "story management," "editor buy-in," "trust building," and "CAR stories." These capture the essence without being too specific.

I need to ensure all values are in English and enclosed in quotes. Also, avoid making up any information, so I'll leave any unspecified fields as null or omit them if not applicable.

Putting it all together, I structure each key appropriately, making sure the JSON syntax is correct with commas and brackets in place.
