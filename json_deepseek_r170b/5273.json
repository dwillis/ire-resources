Alright, so I need to create a JSON object from the given tipsheet. The user has provided specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, the id is straightforward: it's 5273 as specified.

Next, authors. Looking at the input, under "By" it says The Associated Press and an email schoolhousesexassault@ap.org. There are no individual names mentioned, so I'll set name to null. Affiliation is clearly The Associated Press since that's their organization.

For conference, it mentions IRE Phoenix, so the conference key should be "IRE".

The year is given as June 24, 2017, so year will be 2017.

Title is clear: "Investigating Sexual Abuse".

Description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about investigating sexual assault in K-12 schools and provides various methods for obtaining records despite privacy laws. So I'll write it as a 1-2 sentence overview.

Keywords should include relevant terms without including the conference or authors. From the content, "sexual abuse", "K-12 students", "school districts", "FOIA requests", and "investigative reporting" are all key topics.

Putting it all together, I structure each part accordingly to form the JSON object as per the instructions.

```json
{
  "id": 5273,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": "schoolhousesexassault@ap.org",
      "affiliation": "The Associated Press"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2017,
  "title": "Investigating Sexual Abuse",
  "description": "A tipsheet from an IRE conference session on investigating sexual abuse, particularly in K-12 schools, with strategies for obtaining records and conducting interviews.",
  "keywords": [
    "sexual abuse",
    "K-12 students",
    "school districts",
    "FOIA requests",
    "investigative reporting"
  ]
}
```
