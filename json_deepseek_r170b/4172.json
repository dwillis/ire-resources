Okay, I need to create a JSON object from the given tipsheet. The user provided specific instructions on the structure.

First, the id is given as 4172. Then, looking at the authors: Michael Beckel is listed with his affiliation as Center for Public Integrity. His email isn't mentioned, so it's null.

The conference isn't explicitly stated in the text, so I'll go with "Not Listed". The year is also not provided, hence it remains "Not Listed".

For the title, it's clearly "Tracking money and influence in politics". The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers sources for lobbying, campaign finance, union reports, etc., so I'll mention those.

Keywords should include relevant terms: Lobbying Disclosure Act, Federal Election Commission, campaign finance, political influence, dark money. These are all central topics from the text.

I need to ensure all keys and values are in English and enclosed in quotes. Also, avoid making up any information not provided.
