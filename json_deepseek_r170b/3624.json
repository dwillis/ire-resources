Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has specific instructions on how to structure this JSON.

First, I'll start by identifying the required keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The id is given as 3624, so that's straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors. The tipsheet mentions Patricia Murietta with an example. So her name is "Patricia Murietta". Since there's no email or affiliation provided in the text, both will be null.

The conference is mentioned as IRE, so that's set.

For the year, the tipsheet doesn't specify when it was presented, so I'll put "Not Listed".

The title of the session is clear: "Making Friends with Map Projections". 

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The main points are understanding map projections' importance and how different systems can affect data representation. So, I'll summarize that in one or two sentences.

Keywords should be no more than five terms excluding conference and authors. The relevant keywords here are "map projections", "spatial data", "GIS", "cartography", and "SRID".

Putting it all together, I need to ensure each key is properly quoted and the structure is correct without any markdown formatting.

```json
{
  "id": 3624,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Making Friends with Map Projections",
  "description": "This tipsheet discusses the importance of understanding map projections and their implications for accurately representing spatial data.",
  "keywords": [
    "map projections",
    "spatial data",
    "GIS",
    "cartography",
    "SRID"
  ]
}
```
