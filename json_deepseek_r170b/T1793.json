Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from Debbie Wolfe about search engines for Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE). Let me break down each part step by step.

First, the id should be T1793 as specified. 

Next, authors. The text mentions Debbie Wolfe with email dpwolfe@aol.com and affiliation St. Petersburg Times. So I'll create an author object with name, email, and affiliation filled in. No others are listed, so that's the only entry.

Conference is clearly IRE because it's from their conference materials.

Year is given as March 2003, so year should be 2003.

Title of the tipsheet is about search engines, so I'll go with "Search Engine Tips for Journalists".

Description needs to be a concise summary. The document compares different search engines and their features, helping journalists find information efficiently. So I'll write that it's a guide comparing features to help them find info effectively.

Keywords should include the main topics: search engines, journalism tools, Boolean search, online research, investigative reporting. No more than five, so those fit well.

I need to make sure all keys are in quotes and values too. No markdown, just plain JSON. Double-check that I'm not missing any required fields. All looks good.
