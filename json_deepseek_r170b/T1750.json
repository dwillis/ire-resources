Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about water reporting tips from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through this step by step.

First, looking at the input, there are ten tips for reporting on water. The user also provided some website resources and contact information for the Savannah Morning News team. My task is to extract specific details into a JSON structure with keys like id, authors, conference, year, etc.

Starting with the ID: The user specified it should be T1750, so that's straightforward.

Authors: There are three people listed from the Savannah Morning Newsâ€”Kate Wiltrout, Bret Bell, and David Charles Donald. Each has a name, email, and affiliation. Since their affiliation is the same, I'll note that as "Savannah Morning News" for each author.

Conference: The tipsheet is from an IRE conference, so the value here is "IRE".

Year: The input doesn't mention the year of the conference, so I'll set it to "Not Listed".

Title and Description: The title should be concise. Since the main topic is water reporting, I'll go with "Water Reporting Tipsheet". For the description, I need a 1-2 sentence summary. It's about practical tips for journalists covering water issues, so that fits well.

Keywords: The user wants up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Relevant keywords could be "water", "reporting", "journalism", "environmental reporting", and "investigative journalism".

Now, putting it all together in JSON format. I'll structure each key as specified, ensuring correct syntax with quotes and commas where needed.

I should double-check that all author details are correctly captured, especially emails and affiliations. Also, verify that the description is concise and accurately reflects the content without being too lengthy.

Finally, make sure there are no typos or formatting issues in the JSON structure to ensure it's valid.
