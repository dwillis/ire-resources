Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given input. The user provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let's break down what needs to be done step by step.

First, identify all the required keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is specified as T2749. 

Next, looking at the authors section. Scott Zamost is listed with his email and affiliation. I'll structure this as an array of objects, each containing name, email, and affiliation.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE. Since the year isn't provided in the input, it will be "Not Listed".

For the title, I'll extract the main heading from the tipsheet, which is "Writing the Story and Finding the Great Narrative". 

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet discusses how to develop compelling characters for investigative stories, so I'll capture that essence in one or two sentences.

Keywords should be relevant terms from the content, excluding the conference and authors. Terms like conflict, narrative, investigation, characters, and storytelling seem appropriate.

Now, putting it all together into a properly formatted JSON object.

```json
{
  "id": "T2749",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Scott Zamost",
      "email": "scott.zamost@nbc.com",
      "affiliation": "WTVJ-TV/NBC 6"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Writing the Story and Finding the Great Narrative",
  "description": "This tipsheet discusses techniques for developing compelling characters and narratives in investigative storytelling, emphasizing conflict and creative approaches when subjects are unwilling to speak.",
  "keywords": [
    "conflict",
    "narrative",
    "investigation",
    "characters",
    "storytelling"
  ]
}
```
