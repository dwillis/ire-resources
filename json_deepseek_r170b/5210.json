Alright, I'm looking at this query where the user wants me to create a JSON object based on their specific instructions. They provided a tipsheet from Esther Kaplan of The Investigative Fund with details about story commissions, what makes a story investigative, eligibility, and more. 

First, I need to parse all the information given. The main points are about the types of stories they commission, which focus on social impact, institutional failures, and require some originality beyond what's already been reported. They accept applications from anyone but prefer experienced reporters. They support various media forms and have a budget range for first-time reporters.

The user wants me to create a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is 5210. For the authors section, I need to list each author with name, email, and affiliation. However, in the provided text, Esther Kaplan's details are mentioned but without an email or a clear affiliation beyond being the editor of The Investigative Fund. So, her affiliation should be listed as such.

The conference is likely "IRE" since it's from Investigative Reporters and Editors. The year isn't specified, so I'll put "Not Listed". The title should clearly state what the tipsheet is about, probably mentioning Esther Kaplan and The Investigative Fund. 

The description needs to be a concise summary in simple terms. It should capture that the tipsheet outlines their commissioning process for impactful stories, emphasizing investigative elements and support provided.

Keywords are up to five, so I'll pick relevant terms like "investigative reporting", "story commissions", "journalism funding", etc., avoiding conference and author names as per instructions.

I also need to ensure all values are in English unless specified otherwise and that everything is properly enclosed in quotes. Double-checking the structure to make sure it's valid JSON without any markdown or additional formatting since the user specifically asked for only a JSON object.
