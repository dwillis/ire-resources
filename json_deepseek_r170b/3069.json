Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through the requirements step by step.

First, I have to identify each key that needs to be included: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

The id is straightforward; it's given as 3069.

Next, for the authors, there are three names mentioned: Dan Mihalopoulos, Robert Becker, and Darnell Little. Each author should have a name, email, and affiliation. The emails are provided, so I can include those. Their affiliation isn't explicitly stated next to their names in the text, but since they're from the Chicago Tribune, that's clear. So each author entry will have their name, email, and "Chicago Tribune" as the affiliation.

The conference is mentioned at the top as an IRE conference, so that key should be "IRE".

Looking for the year, I don't see any specific year mentioned in the provided text. The investigation talks about the past decade but doesn't specify a particular event year, so I'll set it to "Not Listed".

The title is given as "NEIGHBORHOODS FOR SALE".

For the description, I need a concise summary of 1-2 sentences. The Tribune tracked zoning changes over a decade, built a database from paper records, and found connections between zoning decisions and campaign contributions.

Keywords should be up to five terms that capture the essence without including the conference or authors. Looking at the content: "zoning", "campaign finance", "Chicago politics", "urban development", "data journalism". These seem relevant.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each key accordingly, ensuring all values are in English and properly quoted.
