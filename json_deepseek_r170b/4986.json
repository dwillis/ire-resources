Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given input about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference panel. The user has specified several keys that must be included: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, I'll start by assigning the id as 4986, which is provided in the query. 

Next, looking at the input, there's a section for speakers with four bullet points. Each speaker has their name, handle, and affiliation or background. For each author, I need to create an object with name, email, and affiliation. However, none of the speakers have emails listed, so those will be null. Affiliations are clear for each: Julia Angwin is from ProPublica, Sam Corbett-Davies from Stanford, Nick Diakopoulos from UMD, and Greg Linch from McClatchy.

The conference is mentioned as #NICAR17, which I recognize as the 2017 NICAR conference. So the conference key will be "NICAR" and the year will be 2017.

For the title, the panel is called "Algorithmic accountability panel," so that's straightforward.

The description needs to be a concise summary of the session in simple language. The original text describes how algorithms impact society and the methods for investigating them, so I'll condense that into one or two sentences.

Keywords should be up to five terms related to the topic but excluding the conference and authors. From the topics listed, I can pick "algorithmic accountability," "investigative reporting," "algorithms," "transparency," and "bias."

I also need to ensure all values are in English and properly quoted. No made-up names or informationâ€”only what's provided.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part carefully, making sure not to miss any details from the input.
