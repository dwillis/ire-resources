Okay, so I have to create a JSON object based on the given input about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The user provided specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, I need to identify the id as 4635. That's straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors section. There are two speakers mentioned: Tisha Thompson from NBC4/WRC-TV with her email and Twitter handle, and Sisi Wei from ProPublica with her email and Twitter handle. So each author object should have name, email, and affiliation. Their affiliations are clear from their respective organizations.

The conference is NICAR 2016 in Denver. So the conference key will be "NICAR" and the year is 2016.

For the title, it's "What the Hell is D3? And all the other questions youâ€™re afraid to ask". That's a bit long, but I'll include it as is.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet seems to cover basic terms and tools for journalists in data journalism, including coding, scraping, APIs, mapping, etc. So I can summarize that it explains essential concepts and tools for journalists working with data and visuals.

Keywords should be up to five, excluding conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords would be "data journalism", "coding", "visualization", "mapping", and "tools".

I have to make sure all keys are enclosed in quotes and values are correctly formatted. The description is kept simple, and I avoid making up any names or affiliations beyond what's provided.

Putting it all together, the JSON structure should reflect each part accurately without missing any fields.
