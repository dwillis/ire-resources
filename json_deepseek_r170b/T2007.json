Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through the query step by step.

First, the user has provided a detailed tipsheet titled "Failures in the Justice System" presented at the NICAR Conference in Cincinnati, OH by Mark Schaver from The Courier-Journal. The tipsheet includes general advice for reporters investigating court systems, software used, online legal resources, and data sources.

The task is to convert this information into a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. Each key has particular instructions on how to populate it.

Starting with the "id" field, it should be "T2007". The "authors" are listed as Jason Riley, R.G. Dunlop, Alan Maimon, Jim Adams, and Andrew Wolfson. However, their emails and affiliations aren't provided. Since they're all from The Courier-Journal, I can use that as the affiliation.

The "conference" is NICAR, so that's straightforward. The year isn't explicitly mentioned, so it should be "Not Listed". 

For the title, it's "Justice Delayed, Justice Denied". The description needs to be a concise summaryâ€”maybe something about documenting mismanagement in Kentucky courts.

Keywords should include up to five terms like justice system, court systems, prosecutors, judges, criminal cases. These are relevant and exclude the conference and authors as per instructions.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly quoted. Also, no made-up information; if it's not provided, leave it null or as "Not Listed".

Putting this all together, I structure each key with appropriate values based on the given data.
