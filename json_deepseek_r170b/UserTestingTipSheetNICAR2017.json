Okay, so I need to create a JSON object from this tipsheet provided by Clarisa Diaz and Hannah Birch for NICAR 2017. The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, the id is straightforward: UserTestingTipSheetNICAR2017.

Next, the authors section requires a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. The names are Clarisa Diaz and Hannah Birch, but their emails aren't provided, so those will be null. Affiliation-wise, it's mentioned they're from a news organization, but the text doesn't specify which one. So I'll leave affiliation as null for both.

The conference is NICAR since that's where the talk was held, and the year is 2017 as given in the title.

For the description, I need to condense the entire tipsheet into 1-2 sentences. The main points are about user testing processes for both daily and long-term projects, including methods like quick interviews and feedback implementation. So something like: "A guide on conducting effective user testing for news projects, providing strategies..."

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords are usability testing, user research, design, feedback, and iterative testing.

Putting it all together, I structure each key with appropriate values, ensuring strings are in quotes and proper formatting.
