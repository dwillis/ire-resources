Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id is given as 3893, so that's straightforward. Next, looking at the authors section. The tipsheet starts with Alison Young's contact info: name, email, and affiliation. Her affiliation isn't directly listed next to her name, but since she's from USA TODAY, I'll use that as her affiliation. So the authors array will have one object with her details.

Now, for the conference field, it says "IRE" because that's explicitly mentioned in the tipsheet. The year isn't provided anywhere in the text, so I'll set it to "Not Listed".

The title of the tipsheet is clearly stated as "Using Technology in Your Investigation". For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet covers strategies for scientific testing in investigations, including research methods and team expertise. So the description will mention using technology effectively and best practices.

Keywords are next. I should pick up to five relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, "scientific testing", "investigative reporting", "technology", "research methods", and "journalism" stand out as key topics.

I need to make sure all keys and values are in English and enclosed in quotes. Also, no made-up names; since only Alison Young is listed, she's the sole author in the array.

Putting it all together, I structure each part accordingly without missing any fields. Double-checking for any missing information or errors, ensuring everything aligns with the provided data.
