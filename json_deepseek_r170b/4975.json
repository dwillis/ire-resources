Alright, let me try to figure this out. So the user has given me a query where they want a JSON object based on some specific data about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The input provided is from NICAR 2017 in Jacksonville, Fla., presented by Andy Lehren from The New York Times.

First, I need to identify the key elements required for the JSON structure: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 4975. For the authors, it's a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. Since only Andy Lehren is mentioned without an email, his entry will have name as "Andy Lehren", email null, and affiliation as "The New York Times".

Next, the conference is NICAR because that's explicitly stated in the input. The year is 2017 since it was NICAR 2017. The title of the tipsheet is "Investigating Bias and Influence in Criminal Justice". 

For the description, I need to create a concise summary. Looking at the content, Andy Lehren discussed how data can reveal bias in criminal justice systems by examining records like ticketing and court documents. So the description should capture that essence succinctly.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference or author names. The input mentions topics like criminal justice, data analysis, bias, and influence, so I'll choose those as keywords.

I also need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. No markdown is allowed, just a plain JSON object.

Putting it all together, I structure each part step by step, making sure not to miss any details or add any made-up information.
