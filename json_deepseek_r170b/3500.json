Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. The id is given as 3500. 

Looking at the text, the main author mentioned is James Drew. There’s no email or affiliation provided for him, so those fields will be null.

The conference isn't explicitly stated here. Since it's about investigative reporting and data journalism, I'll go with "IRE" as the conference.

The year isn’t specified in the input, so I’ll mark that as "Not Listed".

For the title, the text discusses how to pitch story ideas effectively, so I'll use "How to Pitch a Story Idea to Your Editor".

The description should be a concise summary. It’s about helping journalists convince editors by showing thorough research and clear evidence.

Keywords are important for searchability. I’ll pick "investigative journalism", "story pitching", "editorial process", "journalistic research", and "news reporting".

Putting it all together, the JSON structure will have the specified keys with these values.
