Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. The input provided seems to be from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me go through it step by step.

First, looking at the authors: Stephen Stock, Jaimi Dowdell, and Chris Schnaars are listed. Their emails and affiliations aren't mentioned, so I'll set those to null. Since they're presenting at an IRE event, their affiliation is IRE, right?

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's straightforward. The year isn't provided in the text, so it should be "Not Listed".

For the title, the tipsheet seems focused on using data journalism techniques to enhance reporting, maybe something like "Using Data Journalism to Enhance Breaking News Coverage."

The description needs a concise summary. It talks about uncovering basic info, testing government procedures, and enterprise reporting with data. So a 1-2 sentence summary would cover these points.

Keywords should be relevant terms without including the conference or authors. Looking at the content, "data journalism," "investigative reporting," "enterprise reporting," "government accountability," and "interactive storytelling" seem appropriate.

Putting it all together, ensuring each field is properly formatted as per the user's instructions.
