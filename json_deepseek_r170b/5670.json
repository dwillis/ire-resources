Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. The input provided seems to be from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet about data journalism. Let me break down what each part requires.

First, the id is given as 5670, so that's straightforward. Next, I need to extract the authors. Looking at the text, it starts with "@Denise Malan | @IRE_NICAR". Denise Malan is clearly an author. Her email and affiliation aren't provided, but since she's associated with IRE_NICAR, her affiliation should be "Investigative Reporters and Editors".

The conference is either IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed. Since the text mentions @IRE_NICAR, it's safe to classify this as an IRE conference. The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the provided snippets, so I'll set it to "Not Listed". 

For the title, the main heading is "Introduction to data journalism", which fits perfectly. The description needs to be a concise summary. The text covers CAR (Computer-Assisted Reporting), its history, tools like Excel and Tableau, and applications in investigations and watchdog reporting. So I'll condense that into 1-2 sentences.

Keywords are next, up to five terms excluding conference names and authors. From the content, relevant keywords include "data journalism", "computer-assisted reporting (CAR)", "investigative journalism", "watchdog reporting", and "data visualization". These capture the essence without overlapping with the conference or author details.

I should also ensure all keys are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Since there's no made-up information, everything is accurate based on the input provided.
