Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on the structure of the JSON, so I'll follow those closely.

First, looking at the input, the title is "Web Scraping with Google Docs". The authors are Acton H. Gorton from the University of Illinois and Sean Sposito from American Banker. Sean's Twitter handle is also provided, but since the user didn't mention including social media handles, I'll focus on name, email, and affiliation.

The conference isn't explicitly stated as IRE or NICAR, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed". The year is also not mentioned in the provided text, so that will be "Not Listed" too. 

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet covers web scraping using HTML/XML and Google Docs, specifically using XPath and ImportXML functions. So, the description should reflect these elements succinctly.

Keywords are next. They shouldn't include the conference or authors but should highlight key topics. From the content, relevant keywords would be "web scraping", "HTML", "XPath", "Google Docs", and "ImportXML".

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part carefully to ensure compliance with the user's specifications.
