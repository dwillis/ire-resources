Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down what each part of the query is asking for.

First, the id should be 5077 as specified. Next, the authors are listed with names, emails, and affiliations if available. Looking at the document, Jeff Kelly Lowenstein is the main author, and he has an email provided: jkellylowenstein@gmail.com. Jennifer LaFleur is mentioned as helping with data but doesn't have contact info here, so her email and affiliation are null. John Perry is another helper but also lacks specific details, so similar treatment.

The conference is NICAR 2017, which falls under IRE events, so the conference field should be "NICAR". The year is clearly stated as 2017. The title of the tipsheet is about Linear Regression, and the description needs to be a concise summary. I'll mention that it explains how to use linear regression for investigative reporting, covering concepts like OLS, R-squared, and software tools.

For keywords, I should include relevant terms without including the conference or authors. So, "Linear Regression," "OLS," "R-squared," "Data Analysis," and "Statistical Modeling" fit well as they capture the essence of the content.

I need to ensure all keys are in English and properly quoted. Also, since no other languages are involved, everything stays in English. Each part is now structured into the required JSON format with appropriate nesting for authors.
