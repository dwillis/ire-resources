Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the id is given as 5491, so that's straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors: Tom Meagher, Annie Daniel, Mark Nichols. The user mentioned not to make up any names and leave name null if none is listed. However, in this case, all three are provided. For emails and affiliations, since thereâ€™s no specific info given, I'll set them to null.

The conference is clearly the 2018 CAR conference in Chicago, which I know is associated with NICAR, so the conference key should be "NICAR". The year is 2018, as stated in the text.

For the title, it's "Creating a data culture that lasts".

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about building lasting support for data journalism through visibility, collaboration, and demonstrating value. So I'll phrase that into one or two simple sentences.

Keywords should exclude the conference and authors but include relevant terms like data journalism, newsrooms, collaboration, etc. I need to keep it to five or fewer.

Putting it all together, ensuring each part is correctly formatted in JSON with proper quotation marks and structure.
