Alright, let's break down what the user has asked for here. They provided a detailed tipsheet from an IRE conference panel on sports investigations and want me to convert that into a specific JSON object with predefined keys.

First, I'll start by identifying each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as T2084. 

Next, the authors section needs to be a list of objects. Each author should have name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the input, MaryJo Sylwester is listed with her email and affiliation as USA TODAY. So that's one author. There's no other author mentioned, so the list will only contain her details.

Conference is straightforwardâ€”since it mentions IRE 2004-Atlanta, conference should be "IRE".

The year is clearly stated as 2004, so that's set.

For the title, the panel was about Sports Investigations, so I'll use that.

Description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about investigative sports stories using data from various sources and databases. So I'll craft a 1-2 sentence summary highlighting that approach.

Keywords should be up to five terms related to the content but excluding the conference and authors. From the topics covered, I'll pick "sports investigations", "data journalism", "Title IX", "college athletics", and "high school athletics".

Putting it all together, each value is enclosed in quotes, and the structure follows the specified JSON format without any markdown.
