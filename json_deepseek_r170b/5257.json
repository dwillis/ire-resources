Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has provided specific instructions with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, I'll extract the necessary information step by step. 

The ID is already given as 5257, so that's straightforward. Next, looking at the authors, Leah Kohlenberg is mentioned as the speaker on the panel "Brain Flipping." However, her email and affiliation aren't provided in the text. There are other names like Betty Edwards, Bob Felton, Selam Berhe, and Norman Doidge. But according to the instructions, I should only include authors listed in the tipsheet, which seems to be primarily Leah Kohlenberg as she's the one presenting.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE NICAR in Jacksonville, Florida, on March 3, 2017. So the conference key will have "IRE", and the year is 2017. 

For the title, it's "How Drawing Exercises Your Brain And Why It Might Make You a Better Writer." That's a bit long, but it accurately reflects the content.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet discusses how drawing exercises can enhance cognitive functions beneficial for writing by engaging both sides of the brain. So I'll phrase that into 1-2 sentences.

Keywords should include up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. From the text, relevant keywords could be "drawing," "brain function," "writing improvement," "cognitive exercise," and "journalism techniques."

I also need to ensure that all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Since there's no non-English content here, that's covered.

Now, putting it all together into a JSON structure with the specified keys and ensuring that each value is correctly formatted.
