Alright, so I need to create a JSON object from this tipsheet provided by Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conferences. The user has given me specific instructions on how to structure it with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, the ID is straightforwardâ€”5679 as specified.

Next, for the authors, I need to list each one with their name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the document, the authors mentioned are Steve Berkowitz, Noah Pransky, and Jodi Upton. Their Twitter handles are provided, but not their emails or affiliations. Since there's no explicit news organization listed next to their names, I should leave affiliation as null for each.

The conference is clearly an IRE event since it's from their tipsheet, so that key will be "IRE". The year isn't directly mentioned in the text provided, but looking at the content, there are references to events between 2012-2018. However, without a specific year listed on the tipsheet itself, I should default to "Not Listed".

The title is given as "Watchdogging Sports", which makes sense.

For the description, I need a concise summary of the document. It covers various aspects like athlete crimes, financials in sports, stadium subsidies, and NCAA issues. So, summarizing it into one or two sentences that capture these investigative angles would be appropriate.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords could be "athlete crimes", "financial transparency", "stadium subsidies", "NCAA", and "sports investigation".

I also need to ensure all values are in English unless specified otherwise, which they are here. Also, every key and value should be enclosed in quotes as per JSON standards.

Now, putting it all together, I structure each part step by step, making sure not to miss any details and keeping the formatting correct.
