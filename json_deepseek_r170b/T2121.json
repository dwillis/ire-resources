Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided input. Let me go through each requirement step by step.

First, the id should be T2121 as specified.

Next, the authors are listed in the input. Looking at the text, Vince Beiser is clearly mentioned multiple times with his email and website. However, I don't see any affiliation like a news organization mentioned next to his name, so affiliation will be null.

The conference is explicitly stated as "IRE" because that's part of the title of the tipsheet.

The year is given in the text as 2003, so I'll include that.

For the title, it's "Freelance investigations: Methods and strategies".

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers how to write effective queries for freelance investigative journalism, including samples and advice on engaging editors quickly.

Keywords should be relevant terms from the content. From the text, appropriate keywords are query writing, freelance journalism, investigative journalism, pitch writing, and immigration issues (since one of the sample queries deals with that).

I need to make sure all values are in English and enclosed in quotes. Also, authors is a list, even if there's only one author.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON accordingly.

```json
{
  "id": "T2121",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Vince Beiser",
      "email": "vincelb@att.net",
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2003,
  "title": "Freelance investigations: Methods and strategies",
  "description": "This tipsheet provides guidance on writing effective queries for freelance investigative journalism, including a sample query and advice on engaging editors.",
  "keywords": [
    "query writing",
    "freelance journalism",
    "investigative journalism",
    "pitch writing",
    "immigration issues"
  ]
}
```
