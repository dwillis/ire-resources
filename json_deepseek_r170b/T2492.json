Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the tipsheet provided about covering auto accidents from an IRE conference. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the structure required: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The id is given as T2492, that's straightforward. 

Next, authors should be a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. The tipsheet was prepared by Tom McGinty from Newsday. Since there are no other authors mentioned, the list will have only one entry. Email isn't provided, so it remains null. Affiliation is Newsday.

Conference is IRE because the event was the IRE National Conference in Denver, 2005. The year is clearly listed as June 2005, so that's set.

Title of the tipsheet is "Sources for Covering Auto Accidents".

For description, I need a concise summary. The main points are sources like NHTSA's FARS and local police reports, and practical steps like inspecting vehicles. So the description should mention these aspects briefly.

Keywords should be up to five terms related to auto accident coverage: NHTSA, FARS, Transportation Safety, Police Reports, Vehicle Inspection.

I have to make sure all keys are in quotes, values as well. No markdown, just plain JSON.

Putting it all together now.

    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2005,
  "title": "Sources for Covering Auto Accidents",
  "description": "Tipsheet covers sources such as NHTSA's FARS and local police reports, providing insights into data collection and practical steps for investigating auto accidents.",
  "keywords": [
    "NHTSA",
    "FARS",
