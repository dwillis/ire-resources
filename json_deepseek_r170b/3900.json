Alright, so I need to create a JSON object from this tipsheet about spycraft for reporters. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the title: "Spycraft: Keeping Your Sources Safe" by Steve Doig from Arizona State University's Cronkite School of Journalism. That gives me the author info.

The description should be a short summary. The tipsheet covers methods to protect sources using encryption, anonymous communication tools, and secure internet practices. So I'll phrase that clearly.

Keywords are next. They should include terms like Spycraft, source protection, encryption, surveillance, and Tor. These capture the main topics without being too broad.

Conference is listed as IRE13, so under conference, it's "IRE". The year isn't explicitly stated, but since it's IRE13, that probably refers to 2013, so I'll set the year to 2013.

Authors section: Steve Doig is the main author. His email and affiliation aren't provided, so those will be null. No other authors are mentioned, so the list only includes him.

Putting it all together, I structure each part into the JSON keys as specified. Making sure each value is correctly formatted and enclosed in quotes.
