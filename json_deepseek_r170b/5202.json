Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, let me parse through the input. The tipsheet is titled "BEHIND THE CRIME TAPE" by Justin George from The Marshall Project, who used to be a police reporter at the Baltimore Sun. The content offers advice on building trust with police sources, attending events, maintaining journalistic integrity, and strategies for embedding with the police.

The user wants an id of 5202, so that's straightforward. For authors, I need a list where each entry has name, email, and affiliation. Since only Justin George is mentioned, his name goes in, and since thereâ€™s no email provided, it will be null. His affiliation is The Marshall Project.

Next, the conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's set. The year isn't specified, so it remains "Not Listed". 

The title should be exactly as given: "BEHIND THE CRIME TAPE".

For description, a concise 1-2 sentence summary is needed. It should reflect how the tipsheet helps reporters build trust and develop sources with police while ensuring accountability in their stories.

Keywords are up to five terms. I'll extract relevant terms like "police reporting", "journalistic integrity", "source building", "accountability journalism", and "embed reporting" since they capture the essence without including the conference or author names.

I need to ensure all keys and values are in English and properly quoted. No markdown should be used, so it's just plain JSON. Also, the structure must follow strictly what the user outlined without adding extra information.
