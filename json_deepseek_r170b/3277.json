Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about Jim Schaefer's tipsheet from the IRE conference. First, I'll extract the necessary information.

The id is given as 3277. The author is Jim Schaefer; his email and affiliation are provided, so I'll include those in the authors array. 

Next, the conference is clearly stated as "IRE" since it's the IRE National Conference in Baltimore from 2009. The title of the session is "The Art of Source Development."

For the description, I need a concise summary. It should mention the Detroit Free Press' Pulitzer Prize-winning investigation and how sources were crucial, including obtaining text messages and using FOIA.

Keywords should be relevant terms like "source development," "investigative journalism," etc., but exclude the conference name and author names. I'll limit it to five keywords.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, since the year is provided as 2009, that will go into the year field.

Putting it all together, I structure each key with the appropriate data, making sure not to include any markdown formatting and only use JSON.
