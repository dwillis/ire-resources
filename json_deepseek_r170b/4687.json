Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id is given as 4687, that's straightforward.

Next, authors. The tipsheet mentions Andy Lehren from The New York Times. Since there's only one author listed, I'll create a list with his details. His name is "Andy Lehren," email isn't provided, so it will be null. Affiliation is clearly The New York Times because that's mentioned next to his name.

Conference is NICAR because the tipsheet says "NICAR Conference, Denver 2016."

Year is 2016 as given in the same line.

Title of the session is "Humanizing Data," which is at the top.

For description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about using data to tell stories through different methods like visuals or narratives. So summarizing that into one sentence: "Explains how journalists can use data effectively by humanizing it through storytelling techniques."

Keywords should be relevant terms excluding conference and authors. Looking at the content, "Data journalism," "storytelling," "investigative reporting," "NICAR" (wait, but I shouldn't include conference name as per instructions), so maybe "humanizing data," "data storytelling," etc. Wait, in the initial response, it's ["Data journalism", "Storytelling", "Investigative reporting"]. That seems fitting.

Wait, I need to make sure not to include the conference name. So NICAR is excluded from keywords. The original JSON had those three terms, which are good.

Putting it all together now into a JSON object with the specified keys and structure.

```json
{
  "id": 4687,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Andy Lehren",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The New York Times"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": 2016,
  "title": "Humanizing Data",
  "description": "Explains how journalists can use data effectively by humanizing it through storytelling techniques.",
  "keywords": ["Data journalism", "Storytelling", "Investigative reporting"]
}
```
