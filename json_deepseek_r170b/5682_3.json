Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on this tipsheet from Jeanne Pinder of ClearHealthCosts. Let me break down what's required.

First, the id is given as 5682_3. That part is straightforward. 

Next, authors should be a list where each entry has name, email, and affiliation. The text mentions Jeanne Pinder with her email and affiliation clearly stated, so I'll include that. There are no other authors listed, so the list will have only one element.

Conference needs to be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Looking at the tipsheet, there's a mention of Columbia Journalism Review but nothing about a conference name. So I think it should be "Not Listed".

For the year, I don't see any specific event year mentioned in the text. So that will also be "Not Listed".

The title is provided as "How we do what we do: Tipsheet on crowdsourcing". That's clear.

The description needs to be a concise summary of 1-2 sentences. The tipsheet talks about methods and lessons learned from crowdsourcing health cost data, so I'll phrase it accordingly.

Keywords should be up to five terms. From the content, relevant keywords are "crowdsourcing", "health costs", "journalism", "ClearHealthCosts", and "data journalism".

I think that's all covered. Now I'll structure this into JSON format as specified.
