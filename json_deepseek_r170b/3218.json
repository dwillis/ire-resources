Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided input following specific instructions. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the user wants the response to only include this JSON object. So, no extra text or explanations, just the JSON.

Looking at the input, it seems to be notes from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference panel in 2009 held in Indianapolis. The panel is about international data, specifically focusing on farm subsidies, fish subsidies, lobbying transparency, and business data across Europe.

The author information provided includes Nils Mulvad with his email and affiliation with Kaas & Mulvad. There's also mention of Tommy Kaas as the co-founder, but since only Nils has an email, I'll include him in the authors list.

For the JSON structure, the keys required are id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

- **id**: Given as 3218.
- **authors**: A list where each entry has name, email, affiliation. Nils Mulvad's details are provided; Tommy Kaas is mentioned but without contact info, so his email and affiliation can be null.
- **conference**: The event was part of an IRE conference, so the value should be "IRE".
- **year**: Clearly stated as 2009.
- **title**: Needs to be concise. "International Data Investigations" seems fitting.
- **description**: A brief summary. The panel discusses accessing and analyzing EU subsidies and lobbying data for investigative journalism.
- **keywords**: Up to five terms. Farm subsidies, fish subsidies, EU transparency, lobbying data, investigative journalism.

I should make sure all values are in English unless the original isn't. Also, ensure proper quoting and structure without markdown.

Double-checking everything: id is correct, authors list includes both Nils and Tommy with appropriate details, conference is IRE, year 2009, title accurate, description concise, keywords relevant and within limit.
