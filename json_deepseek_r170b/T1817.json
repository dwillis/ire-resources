Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Thomas H. Gaumer at the Cleveland Plain Dealer. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the ID is given as T1817, so that's straightforward. Next, looking for authors. The tipsheet mentions Thomas H. Gaumer with his contact info and affiliation. So, I'll include his name, email, and set affiliation to "Cleveland Plain Dealer" since it's provided. There are no other authors listed.

For the conference, the header says it's from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference, so I'll put "IRE". The year isn't mentioned anywhere in the text, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

The title is clearly "Getting Electronic Data" at the top. Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet offers advice on obtaining electronic data, dealing with officials, and handling common excuses. So, summarizing that into one or two sentences makes sense.

Keywords should be relevant but exclude the conference and authors. Key points from the text include "electronic data", "FOI requests", "data acquisition", "public records", and "government transparency". These are all central themes.

Putting it all together, I ensure each field is properly formatted as per JSON standards. All values are in English, and any missing info is set to null or "Not Listed" where appropriate.
