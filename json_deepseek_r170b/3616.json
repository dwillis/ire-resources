Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's instructions. The input provided includes a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. 

First, I'll extract the necessary information:

- **id**: It should be 3616 as specified.
- **authors**: The presenters are Jaimi Dowdell from IRE and Mark Wert from The Cincinnati Enquirer. So, each author object will have their name, email (null since not provided), and affiliation.
- **conference**: Since the tipsheet is from an IRE event, this key will be "IRE".
- **year**: The input doesn't mention a specific year, so it's set to "Not Listed".
- **title**: Looking at the content, the main theme seems to be about generating story ideas using government data and building databases. So, a suitable title would be "Ideas for Using Government Data and Building Databases".
- **description**: A brief summary of the tipsheet, which is about helping journalists find creative ways to use government records for storytelling across various beats.
- **keywords**: Relevant terms include "government data", "data journalism", "investigative reporting", "story ideas", and "public records".

I'll structure this information into a JSON object with the specified keys. Each part of the input is mapped accordingly, ensuring that all values are correctly placed without any made-up details.
