Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain, so I'll go through them step by step.

First, the id is straightforwardâ€”it's 4553 as specified. 

Next are the authors. Looking at the document, there are four people mentioned: David Bornstein, Tina Rosenberg, Claudia Rowe, and Greg Borowski. Each has their name, email, and affiliation listed. I'll list them all in an array under "authors," making sure each entry has "name," "email," and "affiliation."

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's easy. The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the text provided, so according to instructions, it should be "Not Listed."

For the title, the document starts with a header mentioning using data to identify 'positive deviants' and adding fresh angles. So I'll craft a concise title that reflects this.

The description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. It should explain how reporters can use data to find positive deviants and apply solutions journalism in their investigations.

Keywords are next, up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. From the text, relevant keywords would include "solutions journalism," "positive deviants," "data-driven stories," "investigative reporting," and "journalism techniques."

I'll structure all these elements into a JSON object, ensuring that each key is properly enclosed in quotes and the values are correctly formatted. I also need to make sure that if any information isn't available, like the year, it's set to "Not Listed" as per instructions.

Double-checking everything: authors have their details correctly parsed, the description is concise, keywords are relevant and within the limit, and all other fields are appropriately filled without any made-up data.
