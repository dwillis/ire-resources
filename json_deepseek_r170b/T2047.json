Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's input following their specific instructions. Let me go through this step by step.

First, looking at the input provided, it seems to be a collection of various resources and websites related to business research, regulatory agencies, and financial data sources. There are mentions of SEC filings, FDIC, SBA, OSHA, and other such organizations. However, there's no clear structure indicating authors, conferences, or specific events.

The user wants the JSON object to have keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as T2047. 

Starting with 'authors': I don't see any names listed in the input text. It's all about resources and links without mentioning who authored this information. So, the authors list should be empty.

Next, 'conference' needs to be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Since thereâ€™s no mention of a conference here, I'll set it to "Not Listed".

The 'year' is also not specified anywhere in the input, so that will also be "Not Listed".

For the 'title', since this is a collection of resources, a suitable title could be "Business Research Resources".

The 'description' should be a 1-2 sentence summary. It's about various resources for investigating companies and businesses.

Lastly, 'keywords' need to be up to five terms. Looking at the content, relevant keywords would include business research, SEC filings, FDIC, company investigations, regulatory agencies.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring all keys are in quotes and proper formatting is followed.

```json
{
  "id": "T2047",
  "authors": [],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Business Research Resources",
  "description": "A collection of resources for investigating companies, including SEC filings, FDIC data, and other regulatory information.",
  "keywords": ["business research", "SEC filings", "FDIC", "company investigations", "regulatory agencies"]
}
```
