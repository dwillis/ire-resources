Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. The input provided is from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet titled "Battling Data Price Tag Inflation" by MaryJo Webster and Ryan McNeill.

First, I'll extract the necessary information. The ID should be 3622 as specified. The authors are MaryJo Webster and Ryan McNeill. Their emails and affiliations are provided in the input: mwebster@pioneerpress.com and rmcneill@dallasnews.com with affiliations Pioneer Press and Dallas News respectively.

Next, I'll identify the conference. Since both authors are associated with IRE events, it's safe to categorize this under "IRE". The year isn't explicitly mentioned, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

The title is clearly given as "Battling Data Price Tag Inflation". For the description, I need a concise summary in 1-2 sentences. The tipsheet offers strategies for journalists to handle data request costs, so that's my focus.

Keywords should be relevant and limited to five. I'll choose "data requests", "public records", "transparency", "investigative journalism", and "cost reduction" as they capture the essence.

I need to structure all this into a JSON object with specified keys. Making sure all values are in English, properly quoted, and formatted correctly without any markdown.
