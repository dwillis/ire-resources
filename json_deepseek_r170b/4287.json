Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON.

First, let's identify all the required keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. 

The id is given as 4287. That's straightforward.

Next, for authors, I see Robert Benincasa is listed. He's affiliated with NPR and Georgetown University. His email isn't provided, so that will be null.

Conference needs to be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". The tipsheet mentions NICAR 2015 in Atlanta, so the conference is NICAR, and the year is clearly 2015.

The title is about Nursing Home Data, specifically Quality of Care & Accountability.

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about using CMS data to analyze nursing home quality, including staffing, deficiencies, and measures like medication use. So the description should mention analyzing CMS data and focus on care quality and accountability.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords would be Nursing Home Data, Quality of Care, CMS, Accountability, Deficiencies.

Putting it all together, each field is filled accordingly with proper formatting in JSON.
