Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors conferences. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id is given as 4682, so that's straightforward. The authors are listed as Burt Hubbard from Rocky Mountain PBS. Since only one author is mentioned, I'll set up an array with a single object containing name, email, and affiliation. Email isn't provided, so it will be null.

Next, the conference is NICAR 2016, which falls under the "NICAR" category. The year is clearly stated as 2016, so that's easy to fill in. The title of the tipsheet is "Investigating Inequality."

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet covers various educational data points like student demographics, discipline rates, teacher turnover, and achievement gaps. So, I'll write it as: "A guide to investigating educational inequalities using data on student demographics, discipline, teacher turnover, and academic achievement."

Now, the keywords should be relevant and no more than five. The main topics are education inequality, data journalism, student demographics, teacher turnover, and academic achievement. These capture the essence without including conference or author names.

Putting it all together, I structure each key properly, ensuring that strings are enclosed in quotes and null values where necessary. This should meet all the specified requirements.
