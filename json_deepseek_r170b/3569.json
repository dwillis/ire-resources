Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, I notice that the tipsheet is about a black market involving Bluefin tuna worth $4 billion. It details how 12 reporters from various countries contributed to the investigation. They used methods like crosschecking vessel registries with blacklists, conducting extensive record searches in multiple countries, using FOI in the EU, and CAR analysis. They also spent a lot of time at docks in several countries.

The findings include that one in three bluefins was caught illegally, valuing the black market at around $400 million annually. The tracking system was flawed with missing data and ghost shipments. Challenges faced by the reporters included secrecy, cover-ups, a tough business environment, legal threats, and cultural differences.

Looking at the structure required for the JSON object: id is 3569. Authors are listed as null since no specific names were given. The conference is IRE because it's from an IRE event. Year isn't specified, so it's "Not Listed". Title is clear: "Bluefin: A $4 Billion Black Market".

For the description, I need a concise summary. Maybe something like: "An investigation by 12 reporters reveals a $4 billion black market in Bluefin tuna, exposing illegal catches and a flawed tracking system." That covers the main points succinctly.

Keywords should be up to five terms related to the content but exclude conference names or authors. So I'll go with ["Bluefin tuna", "black market", "illegal fishing", "tracking system", "environmental crime"].

I also need to ensure that all keys and values are in English, which they are here. No made-up data; authors remain null as per instructions. 

Putting it all together, the JSON should look like what I have below.

```json
{
  "id": 3569,
  "authors": [],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Bluefin: A $4 Billion Black Market",
  "description": "An investigation by 12 reporters reveals a $4 billion black market in Bluefin tuna, exposing illegal catches and a flawed tracking system.",
  "keywords": ["Bluefin tuna", "black market", "illegal fishing", "tracking system", "environmental crime"]
}
```
