Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has specific instructions, so I have to make sure I follow each step carefully.

First, the structure should include keys like id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is given as T1642. 

Looking at the tipsheet, there are two presenters: David Herzog from Missouri School of Journalism & NICAR, with his email dherzog@nicar.org, and David Washburn from San Diego Union-Tribune, email david.washburn@uniontrib.com.

The conference is IRE Annual Conference â€“ 2002, so the year is 2002. The title is "Census 202: Mapping the Data." 

For the description, it needs to be a concise summary in simple language. The tipsheet talks about using desktop mapping for census reporting, comparing it to the impact of sound in movies. It also mentions using mapping software with census data for various investigations like crime and education.

Keywords should include no more than five terms excluding the conference and authors. Relevant keywords from the content are "census," "mapping," "investigative journalism," "data visualization," and "GIS."

I have to structure each author as an object within a list under "authors." Each author has name, email, and affiliation. Since both presenters' affiliations are clearly stated, I can fill those in.

Now, putting it all together, making sure everything is in English, enclosed in quotes, and the JSON syntax is correct.
