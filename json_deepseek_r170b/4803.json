Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Dan Kane at IRE2016. The user has given specific instructions, so I should follow them closely.

First, the ID is straightforward: it's 4803. That’s easy enough.

Next, for authors, there's only one author listed: Dan Kane. His email is dkanenando@newsobserver.com, and his affiliation is The (Raleigh) News & Observer. So I'll structure that as an object within the authors array.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE2016, so the conference key will be "IRE" and the year will be 2016. No issues there.

The title of the tipsheet is provided: "Money, power, secrecy and complexity – a tipsheet on investigative ‘triggers’". That goes into the title field.

Now, for the description, I need a concise summary in simple language. The tipsheet talks about four triggers—money, power, secrecy, and complexity—that journalists can use to find investigative stories. So I'll write something like: "A guide for reporters on using triggers such as money, power, secrecy, and complexity to identify potential investigative stories."

Moving on to keywords. The main topics are the four triggers: money, power, secrecy, complexity, and the overarching term triggers. That makes five keywords total.

I should make sure all values are in English since the original text is in English, and enclose everything in quotes as per JSON standards. Also, ensure that there's no extra information added beyond what's provided.

Let me double-check if I missed anything. The user specified each key clearly, so I think this covers it.
