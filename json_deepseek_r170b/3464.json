Alright, I'm looking at this query where the user wants me to create a JSON object from a given tipsheet. The tipsheet is about free software tools discussed at an IRE conference. 

First, I need to parse the input. The id is clearly 3464. Then there are two authors mentioned: Anthony DeBarros and Jacob Fenton. Their affiliations are USA TODAY and Investigative Reporting Workshop respectively, so that's straightforward.

The conference listed is IRE CAR in Raleigh, NC, 2011, so the year is 2011. The title of the tipsheet seems to be "Free Software: From Spreadsheets to GIS." 

For the description, I need a concise summary. It should mention that it's about free software tools for journalism, covering various areas like text editing and GIS.

Keywords are next. They shouldn't include the conference or authors, so I'll pick relevant terms from the categories mentionedâ€”text editors, office productivity, databases, GIS, and web frameworks.

I need to make sure all fields are correctly formatted in JSON. The authors array has their names, emails as null since not provided, and affiliations based on the text. 

I also have to ensure that each key is enclosed in quotes and the structure follows what's specified without any markdown or additional text.
