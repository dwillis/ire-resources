Okay, so I need to create a JSON object from this input with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 3442. 

First, looking at the input, it's a tipsheet from IRE (Investigative Reporters & Editors), likely presented at their annual conference. The year isn't explicitly mentioned, so I'll put "Not Listed". The conference is probably "IRE" since that's where this tipsheet comes from.

Next, the title of the tipsheet seems to be about business reporting resources, maybe something like "Business Reporting Resources and Tips".

Now, for authors: in the text provided, there are mentions of contacts like datalib@ire.org with a phone number. Thereâ€™s also mention of NICAR listserv and IRE tipsheets. However, no specific author names are given. So, the authors list should have nulls for names, emails, and affiliations.

The description needs to be 1-2 sentences summarizing the content in simple language. The text includes resources like databases, tools, and story ideas for business reporting. It also mentions sources like HMDA data, SBA loans, etc. So, the summary could mention resources for investigating business topics using public records and data analysis.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference names or authors. From the content, keywords could include "business reporting", "data journalism", "public records", "HMDA", "SBA loans". That's five, so that works.

Putting it all together, the JSON object will have:
- id: 3442
- authors: an array with one object having nulls since no specific author is named.
- conference: "IRE"
- year: "Not Listed"
- title: "Business Reporting Resources and Tips"
- description: A concise summary of resources for business journalism using data tools and public records.
- keywords: the five selected terms.

I think that covers all the requirements. I just need to structure it properly in JSON without any markdown formatting as per the user's request.

```json
{
  "id": "3442",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Business Reporting Resources and Tips",
  "description": "A tipsheet providing resources and guidance for business reporting, including data sources like HMDA and SBA loans, and tools for investigating topics such as campaign contributions and tax-exempt organizations.",
  "keywords": [
    "business reporting",
    "data journalism",
    "public records",
    "HMDA",
    "SBA loans"
  ]
}
```
