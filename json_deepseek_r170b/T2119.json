Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has specified that the response should only include this JSON object without any additional text.

First, I'll start by identifying each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

The id is straightforward; it's given as T2119.

Next, for the authors section, there's one author listed: Scott J. Wilson from the Los Angeles Times. His email is provided, so I'll include that. Since the affiliation isn't explicitly mentioned next to his name but he works for the Los Angeles Times, I'll use that as his affiliation.

The conference is clearly an IRE event because the user mentioned it's from an IRE conference tipsheet. The year isn't specified in the input, so I'll set it to "Not Listed".

The title of the tipsheet is "Uncovering the Invisible Web".

For the description, I need a concise 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet discusses how to find web pages not easily accessible through regular search engines, including unlinked pages, pay sites, protected sites, and deep web databases. So, the description should reflect that.

Keywords are next. They should be no more than five terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords could be "invisible web", "search engines", "public records", "deep web", and "databases". These capture the essence of the tipsheet's focus areas.

I'll structure all these elements into a JSON object, ensuring proper formatting with quotes around keys and string values. I'll also make sure that each part aligns correctly without any markdown or extra text.

Double-checking everything: id is correct, authors have their details accurately filled out, conference is set to "IRE", year remains as "Not Listed" since it's not provided, the title matches, description is concise and accurate, and keywords are relevant and within the limit. 

I think that covers all the requirements. Time to put it all together in JSON format.
