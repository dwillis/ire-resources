Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, I'll identify the id as "T2013" since that's provided in the example. Next, looking at the authors section. The text mentions Sarah Cohen from The Washington Post with her email and phone number. So, the authors list will have one object with name "Sarah Cohen", email "cohensh@washpost.com", and affiliation "The Washington Post".

For the conference, it's clearly stated as NICAR 2004 in Cincinnati, so I'll set conference to "NICAR" and year to 2004. The title of the tipsheet is about guardianships, so I'll use "Reporting on the vulnerable: Guardianships".

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The main points are that guardianship systems lack oversight, leading to potential abuse, and how reporters can investigate this using databases and other methods. So I'll write it as a 1-2 sentence overview.

Keywords should include relevant terms without including the conference or authors. "Guardianships", "elderly", "vulnerable populations", "probate court", and "investigative reporting" seem appropriate, covering the main topics discussed.

I need to ensure all keys are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, I'll make sure there's no made-up data; everything comes directly from the input provided.
