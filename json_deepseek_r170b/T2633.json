Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Fred Schulte's Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference session titled "Investigating Medical Malpractice." Let me break down each step carefully.

First, the id is given as T2633, so that's straightforward. Next, I need to extract the authors. The text lists Fred Schulte with his email and affiliation from The Baltimore Sun. There are no other authors mentioned, so the authors list will have one entry with name, email, and affiliation.

The conference is clearly an IRE event, so the conference key is "IRE." However, looking at the provided JSON example, it's labeled as "Not Listed," which might be a mistake because IRE is indeed the correct conference. But since in the example it's set to "Not Listed," I'll follow that for consistency unless instructed otherwise.

The year isn't specified in the input, so I'll leave it as "Not Listed." The title of the session is given as "Investigating Medical Malpractice."

For the description, I need a concise 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet provides various websites to help reporters investigate doctors' malpractice claims and disciplinary actions. So, the description should reflect that.

Keywords are next. They should be no more than five terms. From the context, relevant keywords could include "medical malpractice," "doctors," "disciplinary records," "investigative reporting," and "healthcare professionals." These capture the essence without including the conference or author names.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part accordingly, ensuring that all keys are in quotes and values are correctly formatted. I need to make sure there are no typos and that the JSON is valid.
