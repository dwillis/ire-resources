Okay, so I need to create a JSON object from the given input. The user provided some specific instructions on how to structure this. Let me break it down step by step.

First, they want an id of 4649. That's straightforward. Next, authors should be a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the input, I see Casey Miller with the handle @caseymmiller and Kavya Sukumar with @kavyasukumar. There are no emails listed, so those will be null. The affiliations aren't explicitly mentioned next to their names, but since they presented at an IRE conference, maybe Vox Media is their affiliation? Or perhaps it's better to leave affiliation as null if not clearly stated.

The conference is either IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed. Since the input mentions "Investigative Reporters and Editors conferences," that should be IRE.

For the year, the input doesn't specify when the conference took place, so it'll default to "Not Listed."

The title of the tipsheet is "Making Reusable Graphics with Autotune." That's clear from the slides.

The description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary. Autotune is a system for managing interactive elements like quizzes and charts. So maybe something like: "Autotune is an open-source tool developed by Vox Media that helps create and manage interactive storytelling elements such as quizzes, charts, and image sliders."

Keywords should be up to five terms. Looking at the content, relevant keywords would be Autotune, interactive journalism, reusable graphics, Vox Media, and collaborative tools.

Putting it all together, I need to structure this into a JSON object with the specified keys. Make sure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes.

```json
{
  "id": "4649",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Vox Media"
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Vox Media"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Making Reusable Graphics with Autotune",
  "description": "Autotune is an open-source tool developed by Vox Media that helps create and manage interactive storytelling elements such as quizzes, charts, and image sliders.",
  "keywords": [
    "Autotune",
    "interactive journalism",
    "reusable graphics",
    "Vox Media",
    "collaborative tools"
  ]
}
```
