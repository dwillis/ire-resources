Alright, so I need to create a JSON object from the given tipsheet about managing and editing CAR stories at the NICAR conference in Newark back in March 2006. The user provided detailed steps on how to structure this, so let me make sure I follow each instruction carefully.

First, the id is straightforward: it's T2645 as specified. Next, for authors, I see Doug Haddix listed with his email and affiliation from The Columbus Dispatch. There are no other authors mentioned, so that part is easy—just one entry in the list.

The conference is clearly stated as NICAR, which took place in Newark in 2006, so the year is definitely 2006. The title of the tipsheet is "Managing and editing the CAR story," which I should include exactly as it appears.

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. I'll read through the content again to capture the essence. It's about strategies editors can use when handling CAR stories—things like understanding data, involving the right people, organizing information, planning visuals early, and being prepared for potential issues after publication. So I should condense that into 1-2 simple sentences.

For keywords, I need up to five terms excluding conference and authors. The main topics here are CAR (Computer-Assisted Reporting) stories, editing strategies, data analysis, organization, and follow-ups. That gives me a good set of relevant keywords without repeating the conference or author names.

I also have to ensure that all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. I'll make sure there's no made-up information; everything should be based on what's provided. 

Putting it all together, each part fits neatly into the JSON structure as per the instructions. I think I've covered all the points without missing any key details. Time to format this correctly.
