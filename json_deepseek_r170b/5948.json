Okay, so I need to help create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me start by understanding what's being asked.

The user wants a JSON response with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. They've also given detailed instructions on how to fill each of these keys. 

Looking at the input provided, it seems like the tipsheet is about using Google My Maps for investigative reporting. The author mentioned is Samantha Sunne, and she presented this at #IRE19, which I think corresponds to the 2019 conference.

First, the id should be 5948 as specified. For authors, there's a list, and each entry needs name, email, and affiliation. Since only Samantha Sunne is listed without an email or affiliation, her entry will have name as "Samantha Sunne" and the other fields null. 

The conference is clearly IRE since it's from #IRE19. The year is 2019, extracted from the hashtag. The title can be derived from the content; maybe something like "Google Map Tips for Investigative Reporting." The description needs to be a concise summary of what the tipsheet coversâ€”importing data into Google My Maps and customizing it.

For keywords, I should pick relevant terms that aren't already covered by the conference or authors. So terms like "Google My Maps," "data visualization," "investigative journalism tools" make sense. I'll limit them to five as instructed.

I need to ensure all values are in English since the original text is in English and enclose everything in quotes. Also, avoid making up any information; if it's not there, leave it null or omit it.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each key with the correct data, ensuring no markdown formatting is used. The JSON should be clean and only include the specified keys.
