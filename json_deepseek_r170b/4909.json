Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON.

First, let's break down the input content. It's about Alaska Native Corporations (ANCs) formed under the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. There are details about their formation, participation in federal programs like the 8(a) program, and where to find data related to ANCs such as annual reports, contracts, and other documents.

The user wants a JSON object with keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is fixed at 4909. 

For the authors section, I need to extract all authors mentioned in the tipsheet. The main author listed is Jennifer LaFleur from Reveal | Center for Investigative Reporting. Her email and contact info are provided as jlafleur@cironline.org and @j_la28 on Twitter. Since there's no other author mentioned, the authors list will have only one entry.

The conference key should be "IRE" because the tipsheet is from an IRE event. The year isn't explicitly stated in the input, so it remains "Not Listed".

The title of the tipsheet seems to be about digging into Alaska Native Corporations and other businesses, so I'll use that as the title.

For the description, a concise 1-2 sentence summary is needed. It should explain the focus on ANCs, their structure under the 1971 act, and the data sources available for investigation.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Relevant keywords from the content include Alaska Native Corporations, federal contracts, 8(a) program, ANC data, and Small Business Administration.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part carefully ensuring no made-up names or affiliations. All values must be in English with proper quotation marks.
