Alright, so I need to create a JSON object from the provided text. Let me first read through the user's query again to make sure I understand what they're asking for.

They want a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is given as 3000. For the authors, it should be a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. They mentioned not to make up any names; if none are listed, leave the name null. Also, if a news organization's name is in the text, use that as the affiliation.

The description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. The conference should be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". If the year isn't clear, it should also be "Not Listed". Keywords are up to five terms, excluding the conference and authors' names.

Looking at the input text, I see that there's no author mentioned. It's more of a guide on analyzing military contracts using various tools like Excel, Access, FoxPro, etc. The text doesn't specify which conference it was from or the year. So, for conference and year, they should be "Not Listed". 

For the title, I'll go with something descriptive like "Analyzing Military Contracts and Data". The description will summarize that it's a guide on using tools to analyze military data. Keywords could include things like "military contracts", "data analysis", "journalism tools", etc.

I need to structure this into JSON format, making sure all keys are in quotes and the values follow the specified rules.

```json
{
  "id": 3000,
  "authors": [],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Analyzing Military Contracts and Data",
  "description": "A guide on how to analyze military contracts and data using tools like Excel, Access, FoxPro, and SSPS.",
  "keywords": [
    "military contracts",
    "data analysis",
    "journalism tools",
    "Excel",
    "Access"
  ]
}
```
