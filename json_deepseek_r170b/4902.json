Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's input about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the id is given as 4902. That's straightforward. Next, the authors section requires some attention. The input lists Ken Armstrong from The Marshall Project with his email and Twitter handle. Since there are no other authors mentioned, I'll create a list with one object containing his details. Name is provided, so it's "Ken Armstrong", email is "karmstrong@themarshallproject.org", and affiliation is "The Marshall Project" as that's the news organization he's part of.

Now, the conference field needs to be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Since the tipsheet is from an IRE conference, it should be "IRE".

The year isn't provided in the input, so according to instructions, it will default to "Not Listed".

For the title, the original Spanish title translates to "Building a Narrative: An Incredible Rape Story" but since JSON keys and values must be in English unless the original is different, I'll use that translated version.

The description needs to be a concise 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet discusses techniques like using unanswered questions, empowering readers by setting rules, surprising them with shifts in perspective, avoiding summaries, keeping language simple, focusing on scenes and dialogue, ensuring the final package doesn't reveal the premise, and creating complex characters.

Moving on to keywords, I need up to five terms excluding conference and authors. The main points are narrative techniques, investigative journalism, storytelling, reader engagement, and character development.

Putting it all together, each part of the JSON is constructed step by step ensuring all fields meet the specified criteria.
