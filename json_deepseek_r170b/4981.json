Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let's go through each part step by step.

First, I'll start with the "id" which is provided as 4981. That's straightforward.

Next are the authors. The text lists Jenny Ye with her title as Data Director and her Twitter handle @thepapapa. There’s no email mentioned, so that should be null. Her affiliation isn't explicitly stated next to her name, but since she works for a news organization called WNYC, I'll use that as her affiliation.

Now, the conference is clearly indicated by the mention of "IRE" in the text, so the conference key will have the value "IRE". The year isn’t specified anywhere in the document, so it should be "Not Listed".

For the title, the main project discussed is the @nailbiterbot, which sends alerts for close March Madness games. So the title should reflect that.

The description needs to be a concise summary of what the tipsheet covers. It's about creating a bot that alerts users when NCAA basketball tournament games are close towards the end. So I'll write it in simple terms, mentioning how it uses live game scores and automated tweets.

Keywords are next. The main points include March Madness, close games, Twitter bots, and data journalism. I should limit this to five relevant terms without including the conference or authors.

Putting it all together, each key needs to be enclosed in quotes, and the structure must be valid JSON. I'll make sure there's no extra information added beyond what's provided.

Double-checking everything: id is correct, author details are accurate with available info, conference is set to "IRE", year is not listed, title captures the main topic, description is clear and concise, keywords are relevant and within the limit.
