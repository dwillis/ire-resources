Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. The input provided is about tips for writing a successful Pulitzer Center proposal. 

First, looking at the structure they want: id is 4518. They mentioned authors as a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. Since the text doesn't provide any specific authors, each author entry should have null for name, email, and affiliation.

Next, conference needs to be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". The input is about IRE conferences, so that's straightforward.

The year isn't specified in the text, so it'll be "Not Listed".

For the title, it should capture the essence of the tipsheet. Maybe something like "Tips for Writing a Successful Pulitzer Center Proposal".

The description has to be a concise 1-2 sentences summarizing the content. I'll focus on the main points: the Pulitzer Center offering grants and the key guidelines for proposals.

Keywords should include up to five relevant terms, excluding conference and authors. From the text, "Pulitzer Center", "grant writing", "journalism funding", "international reporting", and "proposal tips" seem appropriate.

Putting it all together, I need to ensure each field is correctly formatted with quotes and proper structure.
