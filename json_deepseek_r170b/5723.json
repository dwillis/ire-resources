Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down what's required.

First, the structure should have specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The ID is provided as 5723, so that's straightforward.

Looking at the authors section, I see names like Sarah Kendzior, Megan Luther, Shawn McIntosh, and Cepheus Phillips. Their emails aren't listed, but their affiliations are mentioned as @Sarahcnyt (probably The New York Times), @MeganLuther (maybe a news organization), @ShawnMcIntosh, and @cephillips. I'll assign affiliations based on these handles.

The conference is clearly IRE since the tipsheet is from them. The year isn't specified in the text, so it will be "Not Listed".

For the title, the main header is "Beyond numbers: Finding characters and stories in data", which fits perfectly. 

The description needs to be a concise summary of the tipsheet. It should mention using data to find story characters, analyzing outliers, time series, and geographic data. I'll keep it under two sentences.

Keywords are next. The important terms from the content are "data journalism", "outliers", "time series", "geographic data", and "storytelling". That's five keywords.

Putting it all together, each author gets an object with name, email, and affiliation. Emails are null since they aren't provided. Affiliations use the news organizations inferred from their handles.

I think that covers everything. Now I'll structure this into a proper JSON format.

```json

  "id": 5723,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Sarah Kendzior",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "@Sarahcnyt"
    },
    {
      "name": "Megan Luther",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "@MeganLuther"
    },
    {
      "name": "Shawn McIntosh",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "@ShawnMcIntosh"
    },
    {
      "name": "Cepheus Phillips",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "@cephillips"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Beyond numbers: Finding characters and stories in data",
  "description": "This tipsheet provides strategies for finding characters and stories within data, including techniques for analyzing outliers, using time series, and incorporating geographic data.",
  "keywords": [

    "outliers",
    "time series",
    "geographic data",
    "storytelling"
  ]
}
