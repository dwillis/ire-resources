Okay, I need to create a JSON object from the given tipsheet about investigating breaking news from an IRE conference. Let me go through each requirement step by step.

First, the id is specified as 4385. That's straightforward. Next, for authors, the input doesn't list any names, so I'll set authors as an empty array. 

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's easy. The year isn't provided in the text, so it will be "Not Listed". The title should be "Investigating Breaking News" based on the content.

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet offers strategies and resources for journalists covering breaking news, so I'll phrase it accordingly.

Keywords are next. I have to pick up to five relevant terms, excluding conference and authors. Looking at the text, "investigative journalism", "breaking news", "journalism resources", "reporting tools", and "news research" seem appropriate.

I need to make sure all keys are in English and properly quoted. Also, no made-up names for authors since none were provided.
