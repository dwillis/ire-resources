Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given input from crowdnewsroom.org by correctiv.org. Let's break down what each part should include.

First, the ID is provided as 4710, so that goes into the "id" field. 

Next, looking for authors. The input mentions Daniel Drepper with email daniel.drepper@correctiv.org and Twitter handle @danieldrepper. Since the affiliation isn't explicitly stated next to his name but correctiv.org is mentioned throughout, I'll use Correctiv as his affiliation.

The conference isn't specified in the text, so it should be "Not Listed". The year also isn't provided, so that will also be "Not Listed".

For the title, the presentation seems to focus on engaging citizens in investigative journalism, particularly through a savings banks project. So I'll name it "Engaging Citizens in Investigative Journalism."

The description needs to summarize the content. It's about involving 500 people and collecting over 10,000 data points on local savings banks by asking specific financial questions. They used student workers and social media for outreach.

Keywords should be relevant terms from the text: "citizen journalism," "investigative reporting," "crowdsourcing," "financial transparency," and "public engagement."

Putting it all together, I structure each part accordingly, ensuring that authors are listed as an array with their details. All values are in English, and everything is enclosed in quotes.
