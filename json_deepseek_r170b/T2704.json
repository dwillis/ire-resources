Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on this tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided some specific instructions, so let me break it down step by step.

First, the id is given as T2704, that's straightforward. Next, for authors, there's only one person mentioned: Chris Henao. His email is chenao@khou.com and he works at KHOU in Houston. So I'll list him with his details.

The conference is clearly IRE since it's from their tipsheet. The year isn't provided, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed". The title of the session is "HOW TO KEEP INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS FRESH".

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The main points are about keeping reports fresh by using specifics, working angles, and digging deeper. So I can summarize that in one or two sentences.

For keywords, I need up to five terms excluding the conference name. The tipsheet talks about investigative journalism, so relevant keywords could be "investigative reporting", "journalism techniques", "storytelling", "forensic journalism", and "public interest". That should cover the main topics without overlapping too much.

I think that's all. I'll structure it into the JSON object as per the instructions, making sure each key is properly quoted and the values are correctly formatted.
