Okay, so I'm looking at this tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conferences. The user wants me to create a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, the ID is given as 4264. That's straightforward. 

Next, authors. In the contact section, there are two people listed: Dave Levinthal and Ben Wieder. Their emails and affiliation with Public Integrity are provided. So I'll list them both under authors, each with their name, email, and affiliation.

The conference is either IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed. Since this tipsheet is from an IRE conference, that's clear.

Looking at the year, the examples given are 2012, 2010, etc., but there's no specific event year mentioned in the text. So I'll put "Not Listed".

For the title, the main heading seems to be about following money in state elections, so I'll use that as the title.

The description needs to be a brief summary. The tipsheet talks about tracking donors and political spending, especially post-Citizens United, so I'll capture that in one or two sentences.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking through the content, relevant keywords would be state elections, campaign finance, donors, Citizens United, and political ads. That's five, perfect.

Now, putting it all together into a JSON structure with each key properly filled out.
