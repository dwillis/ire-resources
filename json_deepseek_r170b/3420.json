Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the tipsheet provided. Let's break down the requirements step by step.

First, the structure should have specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is given as 3420, so that's straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors section. There's only one author mentioned: Maud Beelman from The Dallas Morning News, with her email provided. So I'll create an array with a single object containing name, email, and affiliation.

The conference is clearly stated as the "2010 IRE National Conference," so the conference key should be "IRE". The year is 2010, which matches the event's year.

For the title, it's given as "Bulletproofing the Story." 

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about organizing investigative projects and best practices for editors. So I'll condense that into one or two sentences highlighting these aspects.

Keywords should be relevant terms from the content, excluding the conference name and authors. Terms like "investigative journalism," "project management," "editorial process," "fact-checking," and "transparency" seem appropriate, each encapsulating key points from the tipsheet.

I'll structure all this information into a JSON format, ensuring that strings are enclosed in quotes and proper syntax is maintained.

```json

  "id": 3420,

    {
      "name": "Maud Beelman",
      "email": "mbeelman@dallasnews.com",
      "affiliation": "The Dallas Morning News"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2010,
  "title": "Bulletproofing the Story",
  "description": "A tipsheet offering strategies for editors to manage investigative projects effectively, including organization, document management, source verification, and fact-checking.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative journalism",
    "project management",
    "editorial process",
    "fact-checking",
    "transparency"
  ]
}
```
