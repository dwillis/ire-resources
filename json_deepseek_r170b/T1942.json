Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The id should be T1942 as specified.

First, looking at the authors section. The main author is Holly A. Heyser. Her email is hheyser@pioneerpress.com, and her affiliation is St. Paul Pioneer Press as well as being the President of the Association of Capitol Reporters and Editors. So I'll structure that with name, email, and affiliation.

Next, the conference is IRE since it's from an IRE event. The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the provided text, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

The title is clearly "Statehouse Investigations". For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet provides practical advice for journalists covering state government, like fact-checking claims and analyzing budgets. So I'll write that it offers eight strategies to produce impactful stories beyond daily news.

Now, keywords should be relevant terms without including the conference or authors. Terms like "statehouse", "investigative reporting", "fact-checking", "budget analysis", and "campaign finance" fit well and are within the five-term limit.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part accordingly, ensuring proper formatting with quotes and correct data types.
