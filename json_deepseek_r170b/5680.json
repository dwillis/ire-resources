Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided query. Let me start by understanding what's being asked.

First, the user has given me a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference in Orlando on June 15, 2018. The title of the session is "Self-editing moves you can start today" under the Storytelling Track. The speaker is Andy Hall from the Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism, with his email provided.

The user wants me to produce a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id must be 5680, and authors should be a list of objects each containing name, email, and affiliation. I shouldn't make up names; if none are listed, leave them as null.

Looking at the input, there's only one author mentioned: Andy Hall. His email is provided, so that goes into his object. The affiliation is clearly stated as Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism. 

Next, the conference is IRE since it's explicitly mentioned as the IRE annual conference. The year is given as 2018, so that's straightforward.

For the title, it's "Self-editing moves you can start today". The description needs to be a concise summary of the session in simple language. From the content, it's about tips for pitching investigative stories effectively, focusing on knowing the audience and structuring pitches with clear leads and human elements.

Keywords should include relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. Key points from the content are self-editing, storytelling, pitching, investigative journalism, and freelancing. I'll limit this to five terms: "Self-editing", "Storytelling", "Pitching", "Investigative journalism", and "Freelancing".

Putting it all together, each part of the JSON is filled out with the extracted information. Making sure not to include any markdown or extra text, just the JSON object as specified.

I should double-check that all keys are correctly quoted and the structure adheres to proper JSON formatting. Also, ensuring that values like null are appropriately handled where necessary.
