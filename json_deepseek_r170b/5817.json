Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions, so let me make sure I understand each step correctly.

First, the JSON should have keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is 5817 as specified. 

Looking at the content, Ben Popken from NBC News is the speaker, so under authors, there's one entry with name "Ben Popken". Email and affiliation aren't provided, but since he's from NBC News, I'll put that as his affiliation.

The conference is IRE because it's mentioned in the tipsheet. The year is 2019, which is given in the date (3/09/19). 

The title should be "Finding, cleaning and publishing 200,000 deleted Russian troll tweets" since that's the main topic discussed.

For the description, it needs to be a concise summary of what Ben talked about. He covered how they obtained, cleaned, analyzed, and published data on Russian troll tweets, so I'll phrase that clearly in one or two sentences.

Keywords should include relevant terms without including the conference name or authors. So, "Russian troll tweets", "data journalism", "social media analysis", "election interference" make sense here as key topics discussed.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly quoted. Also, since Ben's email isn't provided, it remains null. 

Putting it all together, I structure the JSON accordingly, making sure each field is correctly filled based on the information given.
