Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on how each part of the JSON should be structured.

First, I'll identify the id as 3032 since that's specified. Next, looking at the authors section: there are two speakers, Robert Benincasa and Doug Haddix. Their affiliations are Gannett News Service and The Columbus Dispatch respectively. Emails aren't provided, so those will be null.

The conference is NICAR in Houston from February 28, 2008, so I'll note that as "NICAR" for the conference key and set year to 2008. The title of the tipsheet is clearly stated as "Writing, editing and presenting the data-driven story."

For the description, it needs to be a concise summary. The document covers strategies for writing, editing, and presenting data stories, emphasizing clarity and collaboration between reporters and editors.

Keywords should be relevant terms from the content: "data journalism," "CAR stories" (which stands for Computer-Assisted Reporting), "story structure," "editorial process," and "news presentation."

I'll make sure each part of the JSON is correctly formatted with quotemarks and proper syntax. All values are in English as per the instructions, and I avoid including any made-up information.
