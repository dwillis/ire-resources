Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has provided specific instructions on how to structure this JSON.

First, let me identify each key that needs to be included: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. 

The ID is straightforward; it's T2713 as given. 

Next, for the authors, I see there are three presenters: Jim Steele from Time Magazine, Joe Stephens from The Washington Post, and Mike McGraw from The Kansas City Star. Each author entry should have name, email, and affiliation. Emails are provided, so I'll include those. Affiliations are clear from their respective news organizations.

The conference is mentioned as the IRE Annual Conference, so that's set under the "conference" key with the value "IRE". The year is clearly stated as 2006.

The title of the session is "Unsung Documents," which makes sense for the topic. 

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary in simple language. I'll read through the content and see that it's about using lesser-known documents in investigative reporting, combining them with other sources, and providing tips on accessing these documents. So, I can craft a 1-2 sentence summary that captures this essence.

For keywords, they should exclude the conference name and authors but include relevant terms from the content. The text mentions FOIA, state records, financial reports, tax liens, etc., so I'll pick up to five of these. Maybe "FOIA," "document research," "investigative journalism," "financial records," and "public records."

I should ensure that all values are in English unless the original isn't, which it is here. Also, make sure to enclose everything in quotes and structure properly without any markdown.

Double-checking to see if I missed anything: authors' details are correctly parsed with their names, emails, affiliations. The description accurately reflects the content without being too lengthy. Keywords are relevant and within the limit of five.

I think that covers all the requirements.
