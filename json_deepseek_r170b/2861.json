Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given input. Let me look through the user's query carefully.

First, the id is specified as 2861, so that part is straightforward. Now, for authors, the user mentioned not to make up any names and leave them as null if none are listed. Looking at the provided text, I don't see any author names mentioned, so the authors array will have an element with name set to null, email null, and affiliation null.

Next, the conference key should be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". The input doesn't mention a specific conference, so I'll default this to "Not Listed".

The year is also not specified anywhere in the text, so that will be "Not Listed" as well. 

For the title, since there's no explicit title given, I'll use a generic one like "Documentation on Crime and Related Resources" based on the content.

The description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. The text is about various criminal activities and resources for reporters, so I can write something concise that captures that essence.

Keywords are up to five terms. The main topics covered are crime documentation, resources, and related activities, so I'll include "crime", "documentation", "resources", "criminal activities", and "reporting".

I should ensure all keys and values are in English as the original text is in Spanish but the JSON needs to be in English unless specified otherwise. Also, making sure everything is properly quoted and formatted.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with these elements.

```json
{
  "id": 2861,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Documentation on Crime and Related Resources",
  "description": "A collection of resources and documentation related to various criminal activities, including statistics, reports, and investigative leads.",
  "keywords": [
    "crime",
    "documentation",
    "resources",
    "criminal activities",
    "reporting"
  ]
}
```
