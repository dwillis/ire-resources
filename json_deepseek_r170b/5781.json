Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to create this JSON object based on the user's query and the provided data. Let me start by breaking down what they're asking for.

First, the user wants a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. They've given specific details about a session titled "The election and political data you’re not using." The authors listed are Sarah Bryner from the Center for Responsive Politics, Michelle Ye Hee Lee from The Washington Post, and Derek Willis from ProPublica.

I need to extract the relevant information from the provided text. The JSON should include id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. 

Looking at each part:

- **id**: They specified it should be 5781.
- **authors**: Each author is an object with name, email, and affiliation. Since emails aren't provided, those will be null. Affiliations are the organizations listed next to their names, so I can fill those in accordingly.
- **conference**: The text mentions "Investigative Reporters and Editors conferences," so that's either IRE or NICAR. Since it doesn't specify which one, but given the context, I'll assume IRE.
- **year**: There's no year mentioned in the provided data, so I'll set it to "Not Listed."
- **title**: It's clearly stated as "The election and political data you’re not using."
- **description**: Needs a concise summary. The session talks about uncovering political influence through various data sources like FEC filings, lobbying records, and ad data.
- **keywords**: I'll extract up to five relevant terms: election data, campaign finance, lobbying, political ads, data journalism.

Putting it all together, making sure each field is correctly formatted in JSON with proper enclosures and structure. No markdown, just the JSON object as requested.
