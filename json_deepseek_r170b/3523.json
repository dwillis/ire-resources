Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, the id is straightforward: it's given as 3523. Next, for authors, there's only one person mentioned, Corey G. Johnson. His email and affiliation are both provided, so I'll include those. 

The conference is clearly stated as IRE Orlando in June 2011, so the year will be 2011. The title of the tipsheet is "Measuring risk: From earthquakes to nuclear plants, how to investigate community preparedness."

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet discusses methods for investigating building safety by examining documents and interviewing experts. So I'll summarize that in one or two sentences.

Keywords should be up to five terms related to the content. The main topics are risk assessment, earthquakes, nuclear plants, construction oversight, and community preparedness. These seem relevant and fit well as keywords.

I have to ensure all keys are properly formatted with quotes, and the values are correctly placed. I'll structure everything accordingly without adding any markdown since the user specified a plain JSON response.
