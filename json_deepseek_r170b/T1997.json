Alright, so I need to help the user by creating a JSON object based on their provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions, so I should make sure I follow them carefully.

First, I'll read through the query thoroughly. They want a response that's only a JSON object with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is T1997 as specified. 

Looking at the authors section, they mentioned it should be a list of elements each containing name, email, and affiliation. I need to extract this information from the input text. From the tipsheet, I see that Holly Yeager wrote the summary, and she's affiliated with The Washington Post. There's another author mentioned without a name, so for that entry, I'll set the name to null but include their affiliation as NICAR if applicable.

Next, the conference is either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Since this tipsheet is from a NICAR conference, I should set the conference key accordingly. The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the provided text, so according to instructions, it will be "Not Listed".

For the title, the tipsheet is about investigating fringe banking and predatory lending, so I'll use that as the title.

The description needs to be a concise 1-2 sentence summary. I'll make sure it's simple and captures the essence of the tipsheet, which is guiding journalists on how to investigate these financial practices.

Keywords are limited to five terms. I'll extract relevant ones like "fringe banking", "predatory lending", "financial exploitation", etc., making sure not to include conference names or authors.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly quoted. Also, avoid making up any information, so if something's missing, it should be null as per the instructions.

Finally, I'll structure everything into a JSON object with correct syntax, ensuring each key is enclosed in quotes and the overall formatting is accurate.
