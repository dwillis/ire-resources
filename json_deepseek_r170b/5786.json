Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let's break down each requirement step by step.

First, the structure should include id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is given as 5786, so that's straightforward.

Next, for the authors, I see "Irena Fischer-Hwang" listed with her affiliation as "Big Local News, Stanford University." There's no email provided, so that field will be null. Since there's only one author mentioned, the authors list will have just one object.

The conference is specified in the query, so it should be "IRE". The year isn't explicitly mentioned, so I'll set it to "Not Listed".

For the title, the main heading is "Federal Audit Clearinghouse data", which seems appropriate. 

The description needs a concise summary. The tipsheet discusses how Single Audits are performed on entities expending federal funds and where to find this data. So, I'll craft a 1-2 sentence summary highlighting that.

Keywords should be relevant terms from the content. "Federal Audit Clearinghouse", "Single Audits", "financial awards", "audit data", and "investigative reporting" seem fitting without exceeding five.

I also need to ensure all keys are enclosed in quotes, values are in English unless specified otherwise, and no extra information is added beyond what's provided.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON accordingly.

```json
{
  "id": 5786,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Federal Audit Clearinghouse data",
  "description": "A collection of selected fields from Form SF-SAC filled out for Single Audits dating from 1997 to present day. It includes information on federal awards, audit opinions, and other related details.",
  "keywords": [
    "Federal Audit Clearinghouse",
    "Single Audits",
    "Form SF-SAC",
    "federal awards",
    "audit data"
  ]
}
```
