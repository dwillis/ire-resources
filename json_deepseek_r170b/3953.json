Alright, I need to help the user create a JSON object from their query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, the user provided a detailed structure of the desired JSON keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. They specified that the id should be 3953. So I'll start by setting that.

Next, the authors are listed as Jennifer Hiller with her email and affiliation. The example they gave had null for name since it wasn't explicitly mentioned, but in this case, Jennifer's name is provided. Her email is jhiller@express-news.net and she's affiliated with Express-News. So I'll structure the authors array accordingly.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE 2013, so that goes into the conference field. The year is 2013 since it's part of the conference name.

For the title, the tipsheet is titled "Covering shale drilling," which seems appropriate. 

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary in simple language. The original text covers various aspects like understanding the business, tracking activity, fracking chemicals, oil field injuries, and how to get on-site. I'll condense this into a couple of sentences that highlight the main points.

Keywords should be no more than five terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking at the content, "shale drilling," "fracking," "OSHA," "oil field injuries," and "corporate filings" seem relevant and fit within the limit.

I need to make sure all values are in English as per the instructions. Also, each key and value must be enclosed in quotes, and the structure should strictly follow JSON formatting without any markdown.

Double-checking everything: id is set correctly, authors have accurate details, conference and year are properly noted, title is clear, description summarizes well, keywords are concise and relevant. I think that covers all the requirements.
