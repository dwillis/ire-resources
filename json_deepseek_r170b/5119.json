Okay, I need to help the user by creating a JSON object based on their detailed tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has provided a lot of information about business databases, so my main goal is to structure this into the required JSON format with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, I'll look for the ID. The user mentioned it should be 5119, so that's straightforward.

Next are the authors. The tipsheet lists Steve Doig from the Cronkite School at ASU. His email is provided as steve.doig@asu.edu. So the authors array will have one object with his name, email, and affiliation.

The conference is clearly an IRE event, so that's set. As for the year, I don't see any specific year mentioned in the text, so it should be "Not Listed".

The title of the tipsheet is "10 Great Business Databases to Mine for Stories". The description needs to be a concise summary. Looking at the content, it covers various databases like Census, SEC, BLS, etc., which help journalists find business data. So I'll craft a simple sentence explaining that.

For keywords, I need up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. The main topics are business databases, economic data, government sources, investigative journalism, and public records. These seem relevant and concise.

I should ensure all values are in English and properly quoted. No markdown, just plain JSON with each key correctly formatted.
