Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has provided detailed instructions, so I should follow them carefully.

First, the structure of the JSON is specified with keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The ID must be 4158. 

Looking at the input, there's an author named Mike Baker from The Seattle Times. His email and Twitter handle are provided, so I'll include those in the authors array. Since only one author is listed, that's straightforward.

The conference isn't explicitly mentioned as IRE or NICAR, but since it's about Investigative Reporters and Editors, I think "IRE" makes sense here. The year isn't given, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

For the title, it's clear: "Investigating Natural Disasters". 

The description needs to be a concise summary in 1-2 sentences. It should capture the main idea of preparing journalists for natural disaster reporting by planning, gathering data, and identifying sources.

Keywords are limited to five terms. From the content, relevant keywords would include natural disasters, emergency plans, environmental impacts, FOIA requests, and government records.

Putting it all together, I structure each part as per instructions, making sure to handle cases where information isn't available by using nulls appropriately.
