Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me start by understanding what exactly they're asking for.

The input provided is from the IRE Boston Conference in 2012, specifically about managing multimedia projects. There are three main sections: planning before starting, keeping the project on track, and post-launch strategies. The authors involved are Rose Ciotta from The Philadelphia Inquirer, Anthony DeBarros from USA TODAY, and Sarah Moughty from Frontline.

First, I need to extract the relevant information for each key in the JSON object. The id is given as 3708, which is straightforward. 

Next, the authors section should be a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. For each author mentioned, I'll include their full name if provided. Since emails are listed, I'll add those too. Affiliations will be the news organizations they're associated with.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE Boston Conference—2012", so the conference key will be "IRE". The year is 2012, which is explicitly mentioned, so that's easy to fill in.

For the title, I'll use the main heading provided: "Managing Multimedia Projects".

The description needs to be a concise summary of the tipsheet. I should focus on what the tipsheet covers—planning, managing, and post-launch strategies for multimedia projects. It should be simple and clear, maybe one or two sentences.

Keywords are next. They should be relevant terms excluding the conference name and authors. From the content, suitable keywords might include "multimedia", "projects", "management", "journalism", and "strategy". I'll make sure not to exceed five.

I need to ensure that all values are in English unless otherwise specified, which they are here. Also, every key and string value must be enclosed in quotes as per JSON standards.

Now, putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with the id, authors array, conference type, year, title, a brief description, and keywords. I'll double-check that each author's details match what's provided without making up any information or affiliations.

I think that covers everything the user asked for. Let me format it correctly to make sure it's valid JSON.
