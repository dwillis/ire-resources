Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors conference. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the id is provided as T2634, that's straightforward.

Next, looking for authors. The document mentions David Dietz, who is a Senior Writer at Bloomberg Markets Magazine. His contact info is there too: phone numbers, fax, and email ddietz1@bloomberg.net. So I'll list him with his name, affiliation as Bloomberg Markets Magazine, and his email.

The conference listed is NICAR, and the year is 2006 because it's mentioned as March 2006 in Newark.

For the title, it's clearly "Proxy Power."

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about using SEC filings, specifically DEF 14A or PRE 14A, to get detailed info on executive pay, directors, stock holdings, etc. So I'll summarize that as how proxy statements reveal company details like executive compensation and governance.

Keywords should include the main topics: "proxy statement," "executive compensation," "corporate governance," "SEC filings," and "shareholder information." Five terms max, so those fit well.

Putting it all together, ensuring all keys are in quotes and values are correctly formatted. No markdown, just JSON.
