Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Jeff Kelly Lowenstein at the IRE 2019 conference. Let me go through each requirement step by step.

First, the id is given as 5918. That's straightforward.

Next, authors should be a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. From the tipsheet, Jeff Kelly Lowenstein is the author. His email is jkellylowenstein@gmail.com, and his affiliation is Grand Valley State University. There are mentions of Nick Penzenstadler from USATODAY, but since he's a colleague mentioned in the content, not an author, I won't include him here.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE 2019, so that goes into the conference field with the year 2019.

The title should be "Reverse Mortgage Tipsheet" as given. 

For the description, it needs to be a concise summary of the text in simple language. The tipsheet provides investigative strategies for covering reverse mortgages, including source contact, court records analysis, data use, and community impact. So, I'll phrase that into one or two sentences.

Keywords are next. They should exclude conference and authors but can include up to five relevant terms. From the content, "reverse mortgages", "investigative reporting", "HUD data", "foreclosure patterns", and "redlining" seem appropriate.

I need to ensure all values are in English unless specified otherwise, which they are here. Also, all keys must be enclosed in quotes.

Putting it all together, I structure each part carefully, making sure not to miss any details or include extra information beyond the tipsheet.
