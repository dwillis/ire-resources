Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. They provided specific instructions on how to structure it, including the id, authors, conference details, title, description, and keywords.

First, the id is given as 5836. That part is straightforward.

Next, for the authors, there are two speakers: Erin Mansfield and Lauren Grandestaff. Erin's email and affiliation are provided, so I can fill those in directly. Lauren only has her name and contact info, so her affiliation will be IRE since she works there.

The conference is NICAR19, which I know stands for the 2019 event. So the year should be 2019, and the conference type is NICAR.

The title of the tipsheet is "You just survived NICAR19! Now what? Tips on how to use and share everything you just learned." That's clear from the document.

For the description, I need a concise summary. The main idea is helping journalists apply what they learned at the conference, so I'll write something like: "Provides tips and strategies for applying knowledge gained at NICAR19, including organizing materials, practicing skills, and sharing insights with newsrooms."

Keywords should be relevant but exclude the conference name and authors. From the content, "data journalism," "professional development," "training," "newsroom collaboration," and "skill application" seem appropriate.

I also need to ensure that all values are in English and correctly enclosed in quotes without any markdown formatting.
