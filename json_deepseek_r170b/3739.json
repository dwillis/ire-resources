Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has provided specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, I'll identify the id as 3739 since that's specified. Next, I look for authors. There's Kendall Taggart listed with her email and affiliation at California Watch and Center for Investigative Reporting. So the authors array will have one object with name, email, and affiliation filled in.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE Boston, so the conference key is "IRE". The year is June 2012, which corresponds to 2012. 

For the title, it's "Anatomy of an investigation: Behind the story with two IRE Medal winners." That seems straightforward. 

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. Looking at the content, it's about investigative techniques for construction safety issues, so I'll phrase that into 1-2 sentences.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. The main topics are earthquake safety, construction problems, public records, and investigative reporting techniques. That gives me four relevant keywords.

I need to make sure all keys are in English with proper quotation marks. No markdown or extra text is allowed.
