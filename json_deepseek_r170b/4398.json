Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions, so I should follow them carefully.

First, the id is given as 4398, so that's straightforward. 

Next, looking at the authors. There are two main people mentioned: Matt Waite and Ben Kreimer, but Ben doesn't have an email or affiliation listed beyond being a drone pilot, etc. Fergus Pitt is also mentioned, but his details aren't provided either. So I'll include Matt with his email and affiliation to University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The others will have nulls for missing info.

The conference is NICAR 2013, so the year is clearly listed as 2013. 

For the title, it's "How we turned a half-joke of a NICAR lightning talk into a sensor journalism project." That seems clear.

The description needs to be a concise summary. It should mention that they started with a joke talk and developed sensors for investigating luggage handling. They built five devices, two worked well, and the data collected showed significant impacts on luggage during travel.

Keywords are up to five terms: sensor journalism, TSA, luggage tracking, accelerometer, and NICAR Lightning Talks. I'll list those as they're relevant and not too many.

I need to ensure all keys are in quotes and structure correctly without any markdown. Also, avoid making up any information, so only include what's provided.
