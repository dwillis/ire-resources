Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Terri Langford at the Houston Chronicle, presented at the IRE 2005 conference in Denver. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the structure of the JSON is specified with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. Each key has specific requirements.

Starting with the "id": it should be T2446 as per the user instruction. That's straightforward.

Next, "authors" is a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. From the input, I see Terri Langford listed with her email (terri.lanqford@chron.com) and affiliation (Houston Chronicle). So that's one entry in the authors array. There are no other authors mentioned, so the array will have only this one object.

The "conference" is clearly stated as IRE 2005, so conference key should be "IRE".

The year is given as part of the conference info: IRE 2005lDenver. So the year is 2005.

For the title, looking at the document provided, it's titled "Tips For Document Hunters". That seems clear and fits the bill.

Now, the description needs to be a concise 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. The tipsheet provides advice on finding documents for investigative reporting, so I can write something like: "Tips for reporters on effectively gathering documents, including defining goals, locating sources, and refining requests."

Moving on to keywords. These should be no more than five terms excluding the conference name or authors. Looking at the content, the main themes are document collection, FOIA (since it's mentioned), public records, investigative reporting, and persistence. So those would make good keywords.

I need to ensure all values are in English unless specified otherwise, which they are here. Also, each key and value must be enclosed in quotes as per JSON standards.

Let me double-check if there are any other authors or if I missed something. It seems Terri Langford is the only author mentioned, so that's covered. The email has a typo (lanqford instead of langford), but since it's from the source, I have to keep it as is unless instructed otherwise.

So putting it all together:

- id: "T2446"
- authors: an array with one object containing name, email, affiliation
- conference: "IRE"
- year: 2005
- title: "Tips For Document Hunters"
- description: a concise summary
- keywords: relevant terms as listed

I think that's all. Let me structure this into the JSON format now.

```json
{
  "id": "T2446",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Terri Langford",
      "email": "terri.lanqford@chron.com",
      "affiliation": "Houston Chronicle"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2005,
  "title": "Tips For Document Hunters",
  "description": "Provides guidance for reporters on effectively gathering documents, including strategies for defining goals, locating sources, and refining requests.",
  "keywords": [
    "document collection",
    "FOIA",
    "public records",
    "investigative reporting",
    "persistence"
  ]
}
```
