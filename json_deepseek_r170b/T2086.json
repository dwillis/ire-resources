Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The user provided specific instructions on what keys to include: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, the id is given as T2086, so that's straightforward. 

Next, for the authors, I see Christine Stapleton is listed with her email and affiliation as The Palm Beach Post. Since she's the only author mentioned, the authors list will have one object with her details.

The conference is specified as "IRE" because it's an IRE event. The year isn't provided in the text, so I'll set that to "Not Listed".

The title of the tipsheet is clearly stated as "Investigating Agriculture: Down on the Farm".

For the description, I need a concise 1-2 sentence summary. The main focus is on investigating agricultural practices, regulations, labor issues, and data sources, so I'll craft a brief overview that covers these points.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords include agriculture, farming, regulation, pesticides, and farmworkers.

Putting it all together, each key needs to be in quotes with appropriate values. I have to ensure no markdown is used and the JSON is valid.
