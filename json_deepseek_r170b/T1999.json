Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided input with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, let's parse the input content. The text describes a web scraping tutorial for extracting job listings from an IRE website. There are no explicit author names mentioned in the text, so the authors array will be empty or have nulls.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE" since the URL and context point to the Investigative Reporters & Editors conference.

The year isn't explicitly provided in the input, so it should default to "Not Listed".

For the title, I can extract a relevant phrase from the content. The example given mentions job search, so maybe that's suitable.

The description needs to be a concise summary of the text. It should mention web scraping and extracting job details without getting too technical.

Keywords should include terms like web scraping, HTML, links, parsing, etc., but limited to five.

Now, let me structure this into JSON with appropriate values for each key.

```json
{
  "id": "T1999",
  "authors": [],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Job Search Web Scraping Tutorial",
  "description": "A tutorial on web scraping techniques to extract job listings from an IRE website.",
  "keywords": ["web scraping", "HTML", "links", "parsing"]
}
```
