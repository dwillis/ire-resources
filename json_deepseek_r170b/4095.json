Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id is given as 4095, so that's straightforward.

Next, authors. The text doesn't mention any specific author names, emails, or affiliations. So I'll set "name" to null, and both "email" and "affiliation" to null as well.

Conference is clearly stated as IRE since the tipsheet is from their conference materials.

The year isn't provided in the text, so it will be "Not Listed".

For the title, the main heading is "Weathering the Storm: Using data to bolster the traditional weather story", which captures the essence.

The description should be a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about enhancing weather reporting with data from sources like the National Weather Service and state climatologists. So I'll phrase it as using data to provide context and improve stories.

Keywords are next. I need up to five relevant terms. "Weather", "data journalism", "National Weather Service", "state climatologists", and "GIS data" seem appropriate as they cover the main topics discussed.

I should ensure all keys are in quotes, no markdown is used, and the structure is correct. Double-checking each field to make sure there's no missing information or errors.
