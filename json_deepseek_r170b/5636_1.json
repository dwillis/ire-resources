Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Laura J. Nelson of the Los Angeles Times. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON.

First, I'll identify each key required: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

The id is straightforward; it's 5636_1 as specified.

Next, for the authors section, there's only one author mentioned: Laura J. Nelson. Her email and affiliation are both provided in the tipsheet, so I'll include those. The structure will be a list with one object containing her name, email, and affiliation.

The conference is listed as "IRE" since the document mentions it's from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE).

The year isn't explicitly stated in the text, so according to instructions, I'll set it to "Not Listed".

For the title, the tipsheet starts with "Reporting on transportation", which seems appropriate.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers sources, data, and documents for reporting on transportation. So I'll phrase that into a clear sentence.

Keywords should include up to five relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. The main topics here are transportation, transit, ridership, safety, and data journalism.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. No markdown is allowed, so just plain JSON formatting.

Double-checking everything: id is correct, author details are accurate, conference is IRE, year remains not listed, title fits, description summarizes well, and keywords capture the essence without exceeding five terms.
