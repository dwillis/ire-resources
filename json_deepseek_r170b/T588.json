Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has specific instructions for each key in the JSON.

First, I'll start by identifying the id, which is given as T588. Then, looking at the authors section. The text lists panelists but doesn't provide their emails or affiliations. Since the user said not to make up names and to leave them as null if none are listed, each author in the list will have name set to null, and email and affiliation as null.

Next is the conference name. It's clearly an IRE event, so that goes into the conference key. The year is mentioned as 2003, so that's straightforward.

For the title, it should capture the main topic of the tipsheet, which is about tracking people across borders using the internet. So, "Tracking People Across Borders: How to Get Human Sources on the Net" seems appropriate.

The description needs to be a concise summary in simple language. The tipsheet talks about three methods: web directories, forums, and going behind websites. I'll summarize that into one or two sentences.

Keywords are next. I need up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords would be "web directories," "forums," "discussion groups," "backgrounding," and "investigative reporting."

Putting it all together, each part is filled out as per the instructions, making sure everything is in English and properly enclosed in quotes.
