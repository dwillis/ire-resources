Alright, so I need to help the user create a JSON object based on their query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The user has provided specific instructions, so I should follow them carefully.

First, I'll parse the input data. There's a speaker named Todd Wallack from the Boston Globe with his contact info. The session is titled "Secrets of SEC filings and other financial docs" at the NEFAI event in 2013. The content lists various SEC forms, search tips, alternate sites, and other documents for researching companies.

The user wants a JSON object with keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 3998. For authors, I need to list each speaker with name, email, and affiliation. Todd's info is there, so his entry is straightforward. The other lines have placeholders, but since no names are listed, those should have null for name.

The conference is NEFAI, which I think stands for New England First Amendment Institute. Since it's not explicitly IRE or NICAR, the conference key should be "NEFAI". Wait, actually, in the example provided by the user, they used "Not Listed" because it wasn't clearly identified as IRE or NICAR. So maybe better to put "Not Listed".

The year is given as October 1, 2013, so that's clear.

For the description, a concise summary: The tipsheet explains how to use SEC filings and other financial documents for investigative reporting, detailing key forms and search strategies.

Keywords should be up to five terms. I'll pick "SEC filings", "financial documents", "investigative reporting", "company research".

Now, structuring all this into the JSON object as per the user's specifications.
