Okay, so I need to help this user create a JSON object from their input. Let's see what they provided.

They mentioned that the response should only be a JSON object describing a tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors conferences. So first, I need to identify all the necessary fields: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

Looking at the input, the id is T587 as specified. Now, for the authors, the session leader is Timo-Erkki Heino from TV 1, Finland. There are no other authors mentioned, so I'll list him with his name and affiliation, leaving email null since it's not provided.

The conference listed in the input is the Global Investigative Journalism Conference. The user instructed that if it's not IRE or NICAR, we mark it as "Not Listed." So here, it's "Not Listed."

The year isn't clearly stated in the text, so I'll set it to "Not Listed" too.

For the title, it's clearly given: "Investigative TV - more than hidden camera."

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The session talks about how investigative TV uses different methods like undercover reporting and humor, affecting its credibility and coverage. So I'll write that in simple terms.

Keywords should be up to five. From the content, relevant keywords are "investigative journalism," "television journalism," "hidden camera," "undercover reporting," and "public interest." These cover the main points without including the conference or authors.

Putting it all together, I structure each key accordingly, ensuring everything is in English and properly quoted.
