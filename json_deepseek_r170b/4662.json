Alright, let's see. I need to create a JSON object based on this tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided specific instructions, so I have to make sure I follow them closely.

First, the id is given as 4662, that's straightforward. Next are the authors: Dhrumil Mehta and Reuben Fischer-Baum. Their emails and affiliation are mentionedâ€”both work for FiveThirtyEight. So each author object will have their name, email, and affiliation filled in accordingly.

The conference is IRE since it's from an IRE event. The year isn't explicitly stated in the text provided, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed". 

For the title, the main heading seems to be about working with big geodata without messing up, which fits perfectly. The description needs to summarize the tipsheet in a couple of sentences. It should highlight that they shared lessons from analyzing Uber and taxi pickup data, emphasizing tool selection, data structuring, and avoiding common mistakes.

Keywords are next. I'll pick terms like "geospatial data", "data analysis", "GIS", "PostGIS", and "QGIS" since those are central to the tipsheet's content. They also tie into the tools and methods discussed.

I need to ensure all keys are in quotes and that the structure is correct. No markdown, just a plain JSON. Let me put it all together step by step to make sure I don't miss anything.
