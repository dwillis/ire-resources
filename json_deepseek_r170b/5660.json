Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The id should be 5660, which is provided. 

First, looking at the authors: Lllya Younes from ProPublica. Her email is lylia.younes@propublica.org, so I'll include that with her affiliation as ProPublica.

The conference is IRE since it's part of their tipsheet. The year isn't specified, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

For the title, the main session was about Explanatory Data Reporting on Gramercy Park, so I'll use that.

In the description, I need a concise summary. It should mention the investigation into whether key holders are paying taxes and how property values include park access.

Keywords should be relevant terms: "Gramercy Park", "Property Taxes", "Data Journalism", "Investigative Reporting", "Local Investigations". I'll list them in order of relevance.

Putting it all together, ensuring all fields are correctly formatted with quotes and proper syntax.
