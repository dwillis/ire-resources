Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id is given as 4350, that's straightforward. Next, the authors. There are three authors listed: Todd Wallack, Thomas Thoren, and Abe Handler. Each has their name, email, and affiliation. For example, Todd Wallack's email is twallack@bostonglobe.com and he's affiliated with the Boston Globe. Similarly for the others.

The conference is NICAR 2015 in Atlanta, so I'll set conference to "NICAR" and year to 2015. The title of the tipsheet is "Red Alert: Tools to automatically generate story leads."

For the description, it should be a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about tools for generating story leads through RSS feeds, email alerts, website monitoring, and custom alerts. So I'll make sure the description captures that in one or two sentences.

Keywords are next. They need to be no more than five terms. Looking at the content, relevant keywords would be "RSS feeds," "email alerts," "website monitoring," "story leads," and "automated tools."

Putting it all together, I structure each part into the JSON object with appropriate keys. Making sure that all values are in English and enclosed in quotes as per the requirements.
