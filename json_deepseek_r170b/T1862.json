Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's input. Let me read through the query carefully.

First, they provided details about a panel from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference titled "Death on the Job? Danger and Profiteering." The reporter is Thomas Maier from New York Newsday with contact info.

The main content seems to be tips on documenting undocumented workers' workplace fatalities. They list sources like U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, OSHA, Department of Labor, police reports, and various advocacy groups. 

I need to structure this into a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

- **id**: Given as T1862.
- **authors**: Thomas Maier is the reporter. His email and affiliation are provided, so I'll list him with those details.
- **conference**: Since it's from an IRE event, that's straightforward.
- **year**: The conference was in 2003, according to the input.
- **title**: "Death on the Job? Danger and Profiteering" as given.
- **description**: Need a concise summary. It's about investigating workplace deaths among undocumented workers using various sources.
- **keywords**: Relevant terms are undocumented workers, workplace fatalities, OSHA, labor statistics, immigration.

I should make sure all values are in English and correctly formatted. No markdown, just plain JSON within triple backticks as per the user's instruction.

Let me double-check each field to ensure accuracy. Thomas Maier is correctly affiliated with New York Newsday, email provided. The description captures the essence without being too long. Keywords are limited to five and relevant.
