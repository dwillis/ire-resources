Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has provided specific instructions on how to structure this JSON.

First, let's break down the input. The title is "Ten Lessons From the Courthouse" by Jeffrey Meitrodt, who works at the New Orleans Times-Picayune. His contact info is 504-826-3497 and email jmeitrodt@timespicayune.com. There are ten lessons listed, each with examples.

The JSON needs to have keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. 

ID is given as T2064.

Authors should be a list. Each author has name, email, affiliation. Since only Jeffrey Meitrodt is listed, I'll set his name, email, and affiliation as New Orleans Times-Picayune.

Conference: The tipsheet mentions it's from an IRE conference, so the value will be "IRE".

Year isn't provided in the input, so it should be "Not Listed".

Title is straightforward: "TEN LESSONS FROM THE COURTHOUSE".

Description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary. Looking at the content, it's about investigative reporting tips using court records, so I can write something like: "Provides ten practical lessons for journalists on effectively using courthouse records in investigative reporting."

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Relevant keywords from the lessons include courthouses, investigative journalism, court records, legal research, and reporting techniques.

Now, putting it all together in JSON format with proper structure and ensuring all keys are enclosed in quotes.
