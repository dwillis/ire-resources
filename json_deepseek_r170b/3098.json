Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference and wants it converted into a specific JSON format. 

First, I need to identify the key components required for the JSON object: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The ID is given as 3098, so that's straightforward.

Looking at the authors section, there's Steve Daniels from WTVD-Raleigh-Durham with his email. There's also mention of a second author, but their name isn't listed, so I'll set their name to null and only include the available email and affiliation.

For the conference, since the tipsheet is from an IRE event, that's clear. The year isn't provided in the text, so it will be "Not Listed".

The title is "The Shrinking Newsroom: Watchdog work with limited staff". 

The description needs to be a concise summary. The main idea is about making the most of limited resources through techniques like two-camera shoots and efficient travel planning.

Keywords should include terms that capture the essence without overlapping too much. I'll choose investigative journalism, resource management, media production, cost-effective strategies, and watchdog reporting.

Now, putting it all together into a JSON structure, ensuring each field is correctly populated with the extracted information.
