Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me start by understanding the structure required.

First, the id is given as T2742. Next, the authors section should be a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. The speaker listed is Mary Rose, who's an Assistant Professor at the University of Texas at Austin. Her email is provided, so I can include that along with her affiliation.

The conference is mentioned as the 2006 ISE Conference in Fort Worth, Texas, which falls under IRE events, so the conference key will be "IRE". The year is clearly stated as 2006. 

For the title, it's "Empirical Research on Jury Selection". The description needs to be a concise summary of the content. Looking at the main points, the tipsheet discusses jury representativeness and juror privacy concerns.

Keywords should include relevant terms like jury selection, representativeness, juror bias, privacy, and peremptory challenges to capture the essence without exceeding five terms.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly quoted. Also, since this is an IRE conference, the affiliation for Mary Rose will be her university department.
