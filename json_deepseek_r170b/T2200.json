Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, I'll start by identifying each required key and what information goes into them. 

The ID is straightforward; it's given as T2200.

Next, the authors section requires a list of objects, each containing name, email, and affiliation. From the input, Darcy Spears is listed as the author with her email and affiliation to KVBC-TV. I'll structure that accordingly, making sure to include all details provided.

The conference is mentioned as part of the 2004 IRE Regional Conference in Las Vegas, so the conference key should be "IRE". 

The year is clearly stated as 2004, so that goes into the year field.

For the title, it's "GROWING PAINS: DIGGING UP THE DIRT".

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary of 1-2 sentences. The tipsheet talks about investigating urban sprawl focusing on environmental and health impacts like pollution from construction. So I'll craft a brief summary highlighting these points.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference or authors. From the content, relevant keywords include "urban sprawl", "environmental impact", "pollution control", "construction regulation", and "taxpayer spending". These capture the essence without overlapping with other keys.

Putting it all together, I'll make sure each key is correctly formatted in English with proper quotation marks. I'll also ensure that there are no markdown elements as per the user's request.

I think that covers everything needed to structure the JSON accurately based on the provided input.
