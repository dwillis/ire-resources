Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conferences. The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, the id is straightforward: it's 5743 as specified.

Next, for authors, there are two entries for Kae Petrin from St. Louis Public Radio. Since both have the same name and affiliation but no email, I'll list them with null emails.

The conference is either IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed. The tipsheet mentions it's from an IRE conference, so that's set.

The year isn't provided in the text, so it defaults to "Not Listed".

For the title, it's clearly "Investigating Private Landlords".

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet focuses on identifying bad landlords through red flags like lawsuits and complaints, and using public records. So I'll craft a 1-2 sentence summary capturing that.

Keywords should include up to five relevant terms: 'Private Landlords', 'Investigative Reporting', 'Public Records', 'Tenant Rights', 'Housing Complaints'.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly quoted. Also, avoid making up any information not provided.
