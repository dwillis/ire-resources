Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given query and input. Let's break down what the user is asking for.

First, the user provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference that took place in 2013. The title of the session was "Investigating After a Disaster," and it featured several speakers: Paul Monies, Will Van Sant, Scott Keenan, Brett Shipp, with Sally Kestin as the moderator.

The user's instructions specify that I must generate a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 3905. 

Looking at the "authors" key, it needs to be a list of objects each containing name, email, and affiliation. Since emails aren't provided in the input, I'll leave them null. Affiliations should come from the news organizations listed next to each speaker's name.

Next, the description must be a concise summary of 1-2 sentences. The conference is clearly "IRE" as that's mentioned at the top. The year is 2013, so that's straightforward. 

For keywords, I need up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Relevant terms from the content include disaster investigation, preparedness, post-disaster reporting, government contracts, public safety.

I also need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes without any markdown formatting. Each key-value pair must be correctly structured within the JSON object.

Now, putting it all together:

- Set id as 3905.
- Populate authors with each speaker's name, null email, and their respective affiliations.
- Conference is "IRE".
- Year is 2013.
- Title is "Investigating After a Disaster".
- Description summarizes the tips on preparing for disaster coverage and post-disaster investigations.
- Keywords include relevant terms related to disaster investigation.

Double-checking each field to ensure all information is accurately captured and formatted correctly. That should fulfill the user's request precisely.
