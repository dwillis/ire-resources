Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's input following their specific instructions. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id should be 5716 as specified. That's straightforward.

Next, the authors section is a list. In the input, there's only one author mentioned: Rick Hirsch from the Miami Herald with an email rhirsch@miamiherald.com. So I'll create an object for him with name, email, and affiliation. Since his affiliation is clearly stated as Miami Herald, I can fill that in.

The conference key should be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Looking at the input, there's no mention of a specific conference name, so I'll set it to "Not Listed".

For the year, again, the input doesn't provide a specific year. So I'll mark that as "Not Listed" as well.

The title is given in the input: "WHO’S YOUR AUDIENCE: BUILDING INVESTIGATIVE STORIES WITH IMPACT". That should be used directly.

Now, the description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary. The input talks about creating a distribution plan for investigative stories including checklists and strategies. So I'll craft a concise summary that captures the essence without being too wordy.

Keywords are next. I need up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the text, relevant keywords might be "investigative journalism", "distribution plan", "audience engagement", "SEO", and "social media strategy".

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with each key properly quoted and values filled in as determined.

  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "WHO’S YOUR AUDIENCE: BUILDING INVESTIGATIVE STORIES WITH IMPACT",
  "description": "This tipsheet provides a checklist for creating an effective distribution plan for investigative stories, including considerations for audience identification, platform selection, SEO optimization, and social media engagement.",
  "keywords": [
