Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions, including the structure of the JSON with certain keys like id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, looking at the input, the session is titled "Lighter side of data journalism?" with speakers Jenny Ye from WNYC and Jeff Hargarten from Star Tribune. Their email addresses aren't provided, so I'll leave them as null. The conference isn't explicitly named here, but since it's from IRE, I can set that as the value for "conference." The year isn't mentioned, so it should be "Not Listed."

For the description, I need a concise summary of what this session covers. From the input, it seems they discussed using data journalism not just for serious topics but also for lighter, entertaining stories like Pokémon Go and Halloween candy rankings.

Next, keywords. They include data journalism, lighter side, Pokémon Go, Halloween Candy Index, Baby Name Popularity, urban bias, scraping, QGIS, Mapbox GL JS. I'll limit it to five relevant terms: "data journalism," "lighter side," "Pokémon Go," "Halloween Candy Index," and "Baby Name Popularity."

Putting it all together, the JSON should accurately reflect each part without any markdown formatting, just a clean structure.
