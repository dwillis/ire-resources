Alright, so I'm trying to create this JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) tipsheet. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, the structure needs specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 4973, so that's straightforward.

Looking at the text provided, there are mentions of "Doctors & Sex Abuse" and a person named Shawn McIntosh from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. His email is smcintosh@ajc.com, but his name isn't explicitly listed in the context where he's introduced, just his title as Deputy managing editor. So I should set his name to null since it's not provided.

The conference is likely "IRE" because that's the organization mentioned. The year isn't specified anywhere, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed". 

For the title, "Doctors & Sex Abuse" seems fitting. The description needs to be a concise summary. The text talks about doctors committing abuse but being allowed to continue practicing with minimal consequences. So I'll summarize that.

Keywords should include relevant terms like medical professionals, sex abuse, and regulatory failures. Also, "underreporting" since the hospitals didn't report cases, and "patient harm" because of the violations.

I need to ensure all values are in English, enclosed in quotes, and authors is an array with each having name, email, affiliation. Since only one author is mentioned, I'll include him accordingly.
