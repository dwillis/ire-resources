Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to respond to this query. The user provided a tip sheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference about investigating the immigration crisis on the border by Valeria Fernández and Jude Joffe-Block. They want me to create a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, I need to extract all the necessary information from their text. The tip sheet's title is "Investigating the immigration crisis on the border." The authors are Valeria Fernández and Jude Joffe-Block, but there are no emails or affiliations mentioned, so those fields will be null.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, held in September 2020, so the year is 2020. For the description, it should be a concise summary of what the tip sheet covers. It includes methods for reaching immigrants in detention, fact-checking resources like A numbers and media waivers, data resources from TRAC, ICE COVID-19 data, CBP statistics, detention facilities info, detention management stats, legal resources such as Court Listener, and other tools.

The keywords should be relevant but exclude the conference name and authors. I'll list them as immigration crisis, border investigation, detention, FOIA, data journalism.

I need to structure this into a JSON object with each key properly filled. The id is given as 5998. The authors array will have two objects with names set to null since no emails or affiliations are provided. Conference is IRE, year is 2020, and the description is a brief summary. Keywords are limited to five terms.

I should make sure all values are in English unless specified otherwise. Also, ensure that all keys and string values use double quotes as per JSON standards. No markdown formatting is allowed in the response, just plain JSON.

Double-checking each part: id, authors (with nulls where info isn't available), conference, year extracted correctly from September 2020, title exact, description concise, keywords relevant and within five terms. Everything seems to fit.
