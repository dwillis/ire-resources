Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The user provided detailed information from a session by Bob Young of Public Citizen’s Congress Watch.

First, I'll start with the id, which is given as T1586. Next, for authors, there's only one person mentioned: Bob Young. His email and affiliation are provided, so I can fill those in directly. 

The conference is clearly stated as an IRE Regional Conference in Washington, D.C., and the year is 2002. The title of the tipsheet is about anti-competitive practices in the pharmaceutical industry.

For the description, I need a concise summary. The main points are how drug companies extend patents to delay generics, leading to higher costs for consumers. Tricks include bogus patents, settlements, and using legislative maneuvers.

Keywords should capture the essence without listing the obvious like conference names or authors. So, I'll choose pharmaceutical industry, anti-competitive practices, patent extensions, generic drugs, and drug pricing.

Putting it all together, ensuring each field is correctly formatted as per JSON standards with proper quotemarks and structure.
