Okay, so I'm trying to help this user create a JSON object based on their query. Let me read through what they provided.

They have a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference titled "Digging Online for Global Data" presented by Jeff Kelly Lowenstein in 2014. The tipsheet includes various resources, investigative results, and contact information for different authors involved.

First, I need to extract the necessary fields: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. 

The id is given as 4102. That's straightforward.

Authors are listed with names, emails, and affiliations. I see Jeff Kelly Lowenstein from Columbia College Chicago, his email and Twitter handle. Ricardo from La Nacion in Argentina, and another entry for Sheila Coronel from Columbia Journalism School. So each author should be an object within the authors array.

Conference is either IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed. Since this was presented at an IRE conference, that's clear. The year is 2014, as provided in the tipsheet.

The title is "Digging Online for Global Data." 

For the description, it needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary. It should mention online resources and tools for investigative journalism globally. Something like using data portals, laws, collaborative work across borders.

Keywords are up to five terms, excluding conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords could be "global data," "investigative journalism," "online resources," "transparency," and "collaboration."

Now, putting it all together in JSON format with proper syntax, making sure all keys are enclosed in quotes and values as well. Each author object has name, email, affiliation. 

I should double-check for any missing information. For example, Ricardo's email isn't provided, so that field is null. Same for Sheila Coronel's Twitter handle; since it's not mentioned, her email is null too.

Finally, ensure the JSON structure is valid without any syntax errors.
