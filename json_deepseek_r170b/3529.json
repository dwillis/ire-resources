Okay, so I have to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has already given me an example of what they want, but I need to understand how to approach this if I were doing it for the first time.

First, I'll read through the entire tipsheet carefully. It's about using Tableau Public for real estate data analysis, specifically in a neighborhood in Washington D.C., Shaw. The tipsheet goes into detail on getting the data, formatting it, connecting it to Tableau, creating maps and trend views, building dashboards, and publishing the results.

Now, I need to structure this information into a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. Let's break down each key:

1. **id**: The example uses 3529, so I'll stick with that unless instructed otherwise.
2. **authors**: This is a list of objects, each containing name, email, and affiliation. In the provided tipsheet, there are no specific authors mentioned, so each author object will have null for name, email, and affiliation.
3. **conference**: Since this is from an IRE conference, it should be "IRE".
4. **year**: The example didn't specify a year, so it's "Not Listed".
5. **title**: The title of the tipsheet is clearly stated as "Real Estate Data Analysis with Tableau Public".
6. **description**: Needs to be a concise 1-2 sentence summary. From the content, I can say it's about using Tableau Public for analyzing and visualizing real estate data.
7. **keywords**: These should be relevant terms from the content, excluding conference and authors. The example uses ["Tableau Public", "real estate", "data visualization", "dashboard", "analysis"], which seems appropriate.

I need to ensure that all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, if any part isn't specified (like authors), I leave those fields as null.

Double-checking the structure: each key is a string, and the JSON syntax is correct with commas separating key-value pairs and proper use of colons and braces.

I think that's all. Now, putting it together.

```json
{
  "id": "3529",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Real Estate Data Analysis with Tableau Public",
  "description": "A guide to using Tableau Public for analyzing and visualizing real estate data, including mapping and trend analysis.",
  "keywords": [
    "Tableau Public",
    "real estate",
    "data visualization",
    "dashboard",
    "analysis"
  ]
}
```
