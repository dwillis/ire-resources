Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet focused on investigative journalism for radio.

First, looking at the input provided, the title mentions "Investigative Journalism for Radio" by Sandra Bartlett and John Ryan. So, the authors are clear: Sandra Bartlett with her email and affiliation as CBC, and John Ryan without an email or affiliation listed.

The conference is IRE since it's from Investigative Reporters and Editors. The year isn't specified in the text, so I'll mark that as "Not Listed."

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet covers planning, interviewing techniques, storytelling elements, and multimedia integration. So, I'll summarize it as a guide on those aspects.

Keywords should include investigative journalism, radio journalism, storytelling, interviewing, and multimedia. These capture the main topics without overlapping with the conference or authors.

Putting this all together into the JSON structure with id 3904 and ensuring proper formatting.
