Alright, let me try to work through this step by step. The user provided a chunk of text about using the internet for journalism and wants me to create a JSON object with specific keys. 

First, I need to parse all the information given. The id is T1729, so that's straightforward. Next, authors: in the text, there are mentions of Nora Paul from the Poynter Institute and another site created by a TV managing editor, but no name is provided for the latter. So, I'll list two authors, one with name and affiliation, the other without.

Conference is either IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed. The text doesn't mention any specific conference, so it's Not Listed. Year isn't provided either, so that's also Not Listed.

The title should be a brief summary of the content. Maybe something like "Using the Internet for Journalistic Research."

For the description, I need a 1-2 sentence summary in simple terms. It should mention tips and resources for journalists using online tools to gather data.

Keywords are up to five terms. Looking at the text, keywords could be "journalism," "research," "data gathering," "online tools," and "investigative reporting."

I also need to ensure all values are in English unless specified otherwise, which they are here. 

Wait, I should check if there's any mention of a conference or year in the text. No, so those fields remain as Not Listed.

Putting it all together, I structure the JSON with these elements.

    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
