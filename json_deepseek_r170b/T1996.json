Alright, I need to create a JSON object from the given input based on the user's instructions. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id should be T1996 as specified. 

Next, looking for authors. The text mentions Frank Bass at the end with his email and affiliation. So, the authors list will have one entry: name is "Frank Bass", email is "fbass@ap.org", and affiliation is "The Associated Press".

The conference is identified as NICAR because it's from the National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting in Cincinnati, Ohio, March 11-14, 2004. So conference is "NICAR" and year is 2004.

The title of the tipsheet is "Twelve Easy Census Pieces".

For the description, I need a concise summary. The text talks about using regularly updated Census Bureau data for stories, listing twelve specific datasets. So the description can be: "A guide to twelve recurring Census Bureau data releases that journalists can use for storytelling."

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords are "Census data", "data journalism", "investigative reporting", "demographic estimates", and "government finances".

Putting it all together in JSON format with proper structure and ensuring all keys are enclosed in quotes.
