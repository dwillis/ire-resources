Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on how each key should be structured.

First, looking at the input, the title is "Flesh on the bones" with the subtitle "Using Narrative Techniques in Investigative Stories." So I'll set the title as that combined string.

The author's name is Miles Moffeit, and his contact info is mmoffeit@denverpost.com. He's affiliated with The Denver Post. Since there are no other authors mentioned, the authors array will have just one entry with all these details.

The conference is IRE National Conference in Denver from June 2-5, 2005, so the conference key is "IRE" and the year is 2005.

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about adding storytelling elements like characters, suspense, and emotional landscapes to investigative stories. So I'll summarize that into one or two sentences.

Keywords should be relevant terms from the content but not include the conference or authors. The main points are narrative techniques, storytelling, investigative journalism, character development, and emotional landscape. That gives me five keywords.

Putting it all together, each key is populated with the extracted information, making sure to follow the structure: id as T2425, authors as an array of objects, and so on.
