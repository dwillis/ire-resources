Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on this tipsheet from the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference in 2015. The user has given specific instructions about what each key should contain.

First, let me parse through the input text. It's titled "How to Buy a Candidate" and was presented by four panelists: Michael Beckel, Russ Choma, Eve Byron, and Bill Allison. Each of them is affiliated with different organizations—Center for Public Integrity, Center for Responsive Politics, National Institute on Money in State Politics, and Sunlight Foundation respectively.

The tipsheet describes various resources like OpenSecrets.org, Influence Explorer’s Super PAC tracker, Political Ad Sleuth, Ad Hawk, CitizenAudit.org, FollowTheMoney.org, FEC.gov, and Political Party Time. These tools help track money in politics, including campaign finance data, lobbying efforts, outside spending, and more.

Now, the JSON structure needs to have specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 4521. Authors should be a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. Since emails aren't provided, they'll be null. Affiliations are based on the organizations mentioned next to each panelist's name.

The conference is IRE because it's from an IRE event. The year is clearly 2015 as indicated in the header. The title is "How to Buy a Candidate." 

For the description, I need a concise summary—maybe something about tracking money in politics using various tools and resources. It should be simple and 1-2 sentences.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference and authors. So terms like campaign finance, lobbying data, outside spending, political ads, transparency seem appropriate.

I'll structure each author with their name and affiliation. If any panelist's email or more details were present, I'd include them, but since they're not, emails will be null.

Putting it all together, the JSON should accurately reflect the tipsheet content as per the instructions.
