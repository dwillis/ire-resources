Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has provided specific instructions, so let me break it down step by step.

First, the id is 5684 as specified. Next, the authors are T. Christian Miller and Karen de Sá. I don't see any emails or affiliations mentioned in the text, so those will be null for both authors.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE" since it's from an IRE event. The year isn't provided, so that field will be "Not Listed".

For the title, it's given as "No surprises: Transparency and the Art of the Investigative Interview". The description should be a concise summary. Looking at the content, it focuses on interviewing techniques for sources who've suffered trauma and officials fearing exposure.

Keywords need to be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Relevant terms here are transparency, investigative interview, trauma, sources, and ethics.

Putting this all together in JSON format, ensuring each key is enclosed in quotes and proper structure.
