Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided specific instructions on how to structure it with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, I'll note that the id is fixed at 4519 as per the instructions. Next, looking at the tipsheet, it was prepared by Julia Angwin for the 2015 IRE conference in Philadelphia. So, under authors, there should be a list with one element. Since only her name is mentioned without an email or affiliation, those will be null.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE" and the year is 2015. The title of the tipsheet is "Avoiding Prying Eyes." 

For the description, I need to summarize it in 1-2 sentences. The main point is about protecting sources through various strategies like ACE (Add Noise, Cloak, Evade) and HEM (Hide, Encrypt, Mask), along with tools such as Tor, Signal, etc.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. So, I'll list "source protection," "encryption," "anonymity," "metadata masking," and "communication security."

I also need to ensure all keys and values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes without any markdown formatting. The structure should strictly follow the JSON syntax with each key-value pair correctly formatted.

  ],
