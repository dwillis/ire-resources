Okay, I'm trying to create a JSON object based on the given input about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet from 2018. The user provided specific instructions on what each key should contain. 

First, I need to identify the id as 5742. Then, the authors are mentioned in the text: John Bones from SKUP. Since there might be more authors inspired by others like Brigitte Alfter, Ingeborg Eliassen, and Arun Karki, I'll include them with their affiliations.

Next, the conference is clearly stated as IRE Conference 2018, so the year will be 2018. The title isn't explicitly given, but it's about international data resources, so I'll name it "International Data Resources for Investigative Journalists."

For the description, I need a concise summary: something like a collection of global data sources to aid investigative journalism.

Keywords should be up to five terms. Looking at the content, appropriate keywords would be "data journalism," "international data," "investigative reporting," and "transparency." That's four, so maybe add one more if needed, but I think these cover it.

I also need to ensure all values are in English unless otherwise specified. Each key must be in quotes, and the structure should strictly follow JSON formatting without any markdown.

Now, putting it all together, making sure each part aligns with the user's instructions.
