Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors conference. The user specified that the id should be 5093, which is clear.

First, I'll identify the authors. From the input, the names listed are Kate Howard, Matt Kiefer with his email @matt_kiefer, and Andrew Mollica. Since their affiliations aren't mentioned, I'll leave affiliation as null for each.

The conference acronym given in the header is #NICAR17, so I'll set the conference to "NICAR" and the year to 2017 based on that hashtag.

For the title, it's clearly stated as "Putting your town under a microscope -and keeping it there."

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about starting a new beat by flooding the zone with information like archives, employee lists, emails, and audits. It also covers tracking changes over time using tools like LTDB and monitoring with scrapers or RSS feeds. So, I'll craft a two-sentence summary that captures these main points.

Keywords should be relevant and up to five. From the content, "FOIA," "Local Government," "Census Data," "Investigative Reporting," and "Transparency" seem appropriate. They cover the key areas without overlapping with the conference name or authors.

I'll make sure all keys are in English and properly quoted, avoiding any made-up names or assumptions beyond what's provided.
