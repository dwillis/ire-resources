Okay, I need to create a JSON object from the given tipsheet. Let's see what information I have.

The title of the session is "The Art of the Interview: Strategies for Compelling Storytelling" by Tony Kovaleski. He's the Chief Investigative Reporter at NBC Bay Area.

First, the id should be 4614 as specified. 

For authors, there's only one person mentioned, Tony Kovaleski. His email is provided as Tony.Kovaleski@nbcuni.com and his affiliation is NBC Bay Area. So the authors array will have one object with name, email, and affiliation filled in.

The conference isn't explicitly stated here. Looking at the tipsheet content, there's no mention of IRE or NICAR, so I'll set conference to "Not Listed". Similarly, the year isn't provided, so that field will also be "Not Listed".

Next is the description. It should be a 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. The session covers strategies for conducting effective interviews, including preparation and handling emotional or unexpected situations.

Keywords need to be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords are "interview techniques", "journalism", "storytelling", "investigative reporting", and "communication".

Putting it all together, each key is filled with appropriate values based on the tipsheet.
