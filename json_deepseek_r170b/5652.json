Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet titled "WIN YOUR FOIA APPEALS." Let me break down each part of the requirements step by step.

First, the structure should include keys like id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is given as 5652, so that's straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors section. There are four speakers listed: Jason Leopold, Christine Waltz, Les Zaitz, and Brad Heath. Each has an email, some have Twitter handles, and phone numbers. I need to extract their names, emails, and affiliations.

For each author:
- Jason Leopold is from BuzzFeed.
- Christine Waltz is affiliated with Holland & Knight.
- Les Zaitz is part of Malheur Enterprise.
- Brad Heath works at USA TODAY.

I should list them as an array under the authors key. Each entry will have name, email, and affiliation fields. Since all necessary details are provided, I don't need to leave any fields null here.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's set. The year isn't mentioned in the text, so it should be "Not Listed."

For the title, it's given as "WIN YOUR FOIA APPEALS," which I can use directly after cleaning up any formatting issues like extra spaces or capitalization.

The description needs to be a concise summary of the content. The tipsheet focuses on strategies for appealing FOIA denials by understanding legal frameworks and providing specific language examples. So, I'll phrase it as a 1-2 sentence overview highlighting these points.

Keywords should be relevant terms related to the content but exclude the conference name and authors. Looking at the text, appropriate keywords might include "FOIA," "appeals," "transparency," "journalism," and "public records." I'll ensure there are no more than five.

I also need to make sure that all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. No markdown or additional formatting should be present.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part carefully, ensuring accuracy and adherence to the specified format.
