Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down what's required step by step.

First, the structure should include id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is given as 4926. 

Looking at the input, Sarah Ryley is listed under "Intro to Data Journalism: How to Get Started." Her email is sarahryley@gmail.com and her affiliation is New York Daily News. So the authors array should have one object with name set to "Sarah Ryley," email as provided, and affiliation as "New York Daily News."

The conference is either IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed. The tipsheet mentions both NICAR-Learn and the NICAR Conference, so it's safe to classify this under NICAR.

For the year, the input doesn't specify a particular year, just dates for events like March 2-5. Since there's no clear annual identifier, I'll set year to "Not Listed."

The title is straightforward: "Intro to Data Journalism: How to Get Started."

Next, the description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers free resources and tools for data journalism, so I can write something like, "A guide to getting started in data journalism, including free resources and essential tools for cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data."

Keywords should be no more than five terms. From the content, relevant keywords are "data journalism," "free resources," "tools," "cleaning data," and "mapping." These capture the essence without mentioning the conference or authors.

I also need to ensure all keys and values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Let me double-check that each part of the input is accurately translated into the JSON structure.

```json
{
  "id": 4926,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Intro to Data Journalism: How to Get Started",
  "description": "A tipsheet providing an introduction to data journalism, including free resources and tools for cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data.",
  "keywords": [
    "data journalism",
    "free resources",
    "tools",
    "cleaning data",
    "mapping"
  ]
}
```
