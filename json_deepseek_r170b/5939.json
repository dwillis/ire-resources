Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's input about a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through this step by step.

First, the id is given as 5939, so that's straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors section. The tip sheet was provided by Dave Cawley, who is the host of the podcast Cold. His email is dcawley@ksl.com and his affiliation isn't explicitly mentioned, but since he's associated with KSL through his email, I'll use that as his affiliation.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that goes under the conference key. The year isn't provided in the input, so it should be "Not Listed".

For the title, it's "Driveway moments: The art of long-form audio narrative". 

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet focuses on using audio narratives effectively, so I'll mention that and include some key points like public records requests and transcription issues.

Keywords should capture the essence without being too many. I'll go with "audio narrative", "long-form storytelling", "public records", "transcription", and "investigative journalism".

Putting it all together, making sure each field is correctly formatted and enclosed in quotes.
