Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has provided specific instructions, so I have to make sure each part is addressed correctly.

First, the structure of the JSON should include keys like id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is fixed at 4460 as per the instruction.

Looking at the authors section, there are three panelists: Steve Walters from WisconsinEye, Shawn Johnson from Wisconsin Public Radio, and Dee J. Hall from Wisconsin State Journal. Each author needs to be an object with name, email, and affiliation. For emails, only Dee J. Hall's is provided, so that should be included. The others don't have emails listed, so their email fields can be null.

Next, the conference is mentioned as the Midwest Watchdog Workshop, which I know is part of IRE, so the conference key should be "IRE". The year is clearly stated as 2015, so that's straightforward.

The title of the tipsheet is "Statehouse reporting: Getting the goods and bads." For the description, it needs to be a concise summary. I'll go with something like, "Tips for effectively covering state capitols, including building sources and utilizing online resources."

Keywords should be up to five terms that capture the main topics without including the conference or authors. Terms like "statehouse reporting," "legislative sources," "advocacy groups," "Capitol news services," and "lobbying activities" seem appropriate.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part carefully, ensuring correct data types and proper syntax in JSON format.
