Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let's break down what each part should include.

First, the id is straightforward—it’s provided as 3723. Next, authors: looking at the document, Harrison Gordon is listed as the Program Manager for Excel Services/Excel Web App. I don't see any other authors mentioned, so that's the only one. His email and affiliation aren't provided, so those will be null.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE since it's from their event. The year isn’t explicitly mentioned, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed". 

For the title, the main topic seems to be embedding interactive data using Office Web apps, specifically Excel. So I'll go with "Embedding Interactive Data and Charts Using Office Web Apps".

The description needs a concise summary. It should mention how the session covers adding live charts, tables, calculators, and allowing real-time interaction for better reader engagement.

Keywords are next. They should be relevant and no more than five. So I'll include: interactive content, Excel Web App, data visualization, Office Web Apps, embeddable tools.

Putting it all together, ensuring each field is correctly formatted as per the instructions.
