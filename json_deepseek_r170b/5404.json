Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's input about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The user has provided detailed information from the NICAR 2018 conference session titled "Evolving Forms and the Future of Live Coverage." 

First, I'll identify each required key for the JSON object: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

The ID is given as 5404. 

Next, for the authors, there are four individuals mentioned:
1. Tyler Fisher from Politico.
2. Ham Boardman from The New York Times (NYT).
3. Alastair Coote from The Guardian, who was absent.
4. Tiff Fehr from NYT, who facilitated the session.

I need to structure each author with name, email, and affiliation. Since emails aren't provided, they'll be null. Affiliations are clear from their respective organizations.

The conference is NICAR, and the year is 2018 as it's explicitly mentioned in the title.

The title of the session is "Evolving Forms and the Future of Live Coverage."

For the description, I should write a concise summary in simple language. The session discusses new methods for live coverage, including smart notifications, chat apps, and augmented transcripts.

Keywords need to be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords are "live coverage," "smart notifications," "chat apps," "augmented transcripts," and "journalism innovation."

Putting it all together, I structure each part ensuring correct syntax and that all values are enclosed in quotes as per JSON standards.
