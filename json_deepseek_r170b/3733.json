Alright, I need to help the user by creating a JSON object based on their provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has specific instructions, so I should follow them carefully.

First, I'll start by identifying each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The ID is given as 3733, which I'll include directly.

Looking at the authors section, there are two people listed: Jaimi Dowdell and Mark Horvit. Both have their emails and affiliations mentioned. So each author object should have name, email, and affiliation fields. Their names are clearly stated, so no nulls needed there. Emails are provided, and since both are affiliated with IRE, that's straightforward.

Next is the conference. The tipsheet mentions Jaimi and Mark’s cool Web tools from an IRE event, so the conference should be "IRE". The year isn't specified in the text, so according to instructions, it should default to "Not Listed".

The title of the tipsheet is given as "Jaimi and Mark’s cool Web tools", which I'll use directly. 

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet covers various web tools for tasks like file handling, searching, visualization, and social media. So I'll craft a 1-2 sentence summary that captures this essence.

Keywords are next. I should pick up to five relevant terms, excluding conference and authors. From the content, "Web tools", "file sharing", "data visualization", "social media monitoring", and "productivity" seem appropriate.

I need to ensure all values are in English as per the original text and that each key is properly enclosed in quotes. I'll structure the JSON accordingly, making sure it's valid and adheres strictly to the user's formatting requirements.

Finally, I'll double-check each field to confirm accuracy: IDs, author details, conference name, and the summary. Once everything looks correct, I'll present the JSON object as the response.
