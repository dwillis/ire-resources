Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, I'll look at the structure they want: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is fixed as 5812, so that's straightforward.

Next, the authors section is a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. Looking through the tipsheet, I see three names mentioned: Anupama Narayanswamy, Sandra Fish, and AmyJo Brown. Their Twitter handles are provided but not their emails or affiliations. Since the user said to use the news organization as affiliation if available, and these authors are from Washington Post, I can list that as their affiliation.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's set. The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the text, so according to instructions, it should be "Not Listed".

For the title, the tipsheet has "Breaking out of the traditional election-cycle narrative: How to make your campaign finance data useful year-round", which fits perfectly.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet discusses using campaign finance data beyond elections, covering federal, state, and local levels with examples and resources. So I'll craft a 1-2 sentence summary that captures this essence.

Keywords should be up to five terms. From the content, relevant keywords are "campaign finance", "election-cycle narrative", "data journalism", "lobbying", and "political donations". These cover the main topics without including the conference or authors' names.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each key with appropriate values, ensuring everything is in English and properly enclosed in quotes. I need to make sure there are no markdown formats as per the user's request.
