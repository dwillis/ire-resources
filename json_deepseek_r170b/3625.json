Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conferences. The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, the id is set to 3625 as per the instruction. Next, looking at authors, the original document doesn't list any names, so I'll leave the name as null. Email and affiliation can also be null since there's no information provided about them. 

The conference is clearly an IRE event because the tipsheet mentions "Investigative Reporters and Editors conferences." So, the conference key will be "IRE". The year isn't specified in the text, so it should be "Not Listed."

For the title, the main heading seems to be about creating robot reporters, so I'll use that as the title. The description needs to be a concise summary of what the tipsheet covers. It talks about using automated systems for data analysis and reporting, so I'll phrase it to reflect that.

Keywords should include relevant terms without including the conference or authors. Looking through the content, appropriate keywords are "robot reporters," "automated journalism," "data analysis," "alert systems," and "investigative reporting." These capture the essence of the tipsheet.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with each key properly filled as per the instructions.

```json
{
  "id": 3625,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "How to create robot reporters in your own image",
  "description": "This tipsheet explores how journalists can use automated systems to analyze data streams, identify trends, and generate news content efficiently.",
  "keywords": [
    "robot reporters",
    "automated journalism",
    "data analysis",
    "alert systems",
    "investigative reporting"
  ]
}
```
