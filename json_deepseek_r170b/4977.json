Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down each requirement step by step.

First, the id is given as 4977, so that's straightforward. Next, I have to extract the authors. The names mentioned are Jenny Ye from WNYC and Jeff Hargarten from Star Tribune. Since emails aren't provided, I'll set them to null. Their affiliations are clearly their respective news organizations.

The conference is IRE since it's part of the user's context. The year isn't specified in the input, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed". 

For the title, looking at the tipsheet content, it starts with "Lighter side of data journalism?" which seems appropriate. The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet shows examples like Pokémon Go analysis and Halloween Candy Index, which are lighter, fun uses of data journalism. So I'll summarize that they used creative projects to entertain while informing.

Keywords should exclude the conference and authors. Relevant terms from the content include "data journalism", "entertainment", "Pokémon Go", "Halloween Candy Index", and "Baby Name Popularity". These capture the essence without overcomplicating.

Putting it all together, each part of the JSON is filled accurately based on the input provided.
