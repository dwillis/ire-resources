Alright, I need to figure out how to create a JSON object from the given input based on the user's instructions. Let me break down each step carefully.

First, the id should be "PowerPivot_Hands_On". That seems straightforward.

Next, authors is a list where each element has name, email, and affiliation. The text doesn't mention any authors, so each author object will have null for all fields except maybe affiliation if it's part of a news organization. But since there are no specific names or emails provided, I'll set them to null.

For the conference field, looking at the content, it's about PowerPivot and data analysis, which is common in NICAR (National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting) conferences. So I'll set conference to "NICAR".

The year isn't clearly mentioned in the text, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

The title should be a brief summary of the content. The input includes steps on using PowerPivot, so "Hands-On Guide to Using PowerPivot" seems appropriate.

Description needs to be 1-2 sentences summarizing the text. It's about learning PowerPivot for data analysis and visualization, so that's concise.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. The main topics are PowerPivot, data analysis, visualization, business intelligence, and Excel add-ins. That makes five relevant keywords.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with each key as specified.

```json
{
  "id": "PowerPivot_Hands_On",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Hands-On Guide to Using PowerPivot",
  "description": "A step-by-step guide on using PowerPivot for data analysis and visualization, including creating pivot tables, slicers, and charts.",
  "keywords": [
    "PowerPivot",
    "Data Analysis",
    "Visualization",
    "Business Intelligence",
    "Excel Add-ins"
  ]
}
```
