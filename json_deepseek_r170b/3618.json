Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given input. Let me start by understanding what's being asked. The user provided some slides from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. My task is to extract specific information like id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, I'll note that the id should be 3618 as specified. Next, looking for authors in the input. Scanning through the slides, I don't see any names listed, so authors will be an empty list.

The conference is clearly mentioned as "IRE" since it's about Investigative Reporters and Editors conferences. Now, checking for the year. The input doesn't provide a specific year, so I'll set year to "Not Listed".

For the title, one of the slides has "Getting on the Innovation Curve", which seems relevant. So, the title will be that phrase.

The description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. Looking at the content, it's about rebuilding civic trust through innovation, using models like Brigade, Fellowship, and Accelerator. So, I'll craft a concise summary around that.

Keywords should be up to five terms. From the slides, relevant terms include "Innovation", "Civic Trust", "Open Data", "Civic Tech", and "Community Engagement". These capture the essence without including the conference or authors.

Putting it all together, each field is filled accordingly. I need to ensure that all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. No made-up names since none were provided, so authors remain empty.
