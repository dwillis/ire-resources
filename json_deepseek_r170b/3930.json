Okay, I need to create a JSON object from the given tipsheet based on the user's query. Let me go through each requirement step by step.

First, I'll start with the id, which is provided as 3930. Thatâ€™s straightforward.

Next, for the authors, there are specific instructions. The user mentioned that if no author name is listed, it should be null. In this case, Margot Williams is clearly listed along with her email and affiliation to NPR. So, I'll create an object in the authors array with her details: name as "Margot Williams", email as "mwilliams2@npr.org", and affiliation as "NPR".

The conference is explicitly stated as IRE June 2013, so the conference key will be "IRE". The year is also clear, it's 2013, so that goes into the year field.

For the title, looking at the document, there's a section labeled "Beyond Google 2013" which seems to be the main heading. So I'll use that as the title.

The description needs to be a concise summary of the content. The tipsheet provides various resources and tools for investigative research, including databases, FOIA resources, digital libraries, etc. So I can summarize it in one sentence mentioning the key points without getting too detailed.

Now, keywords should be up to five terms, excluding the conference name and authors. Looking through the document, relevant keywords would include "investigative journalism", "research tools", "FOIA resources", "digital libraries", and "lobbying disclosure". These capture the essence of what the tipsheet covers.

I need to ensure all keys and values are enclosed in quotes and use English unless specified otherwise. Also, avoid making up any names or details not present in the text.

Putting it all together, I structure each part carefully, ensuring that each key is correctly assigned based on the instructions.
