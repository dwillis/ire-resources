Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has provided specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, looking at the id: it's specified as 3029, so that's straightforward.

Next, authors is a list of elements with name, email, and affiliation. From the input, I see Tisha Thompson listed with her email and affiliation to WTTG-TV Fox 5 News. There are no other authors mentioned, so the authors array will have just one object with her details.

The conference is either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Since the document refers to NICAR listserv and mentions IRE in the URLs, it's safe to classify this as an IRE conference.

For the year, there's no specific date mentioned in the text. So according to the instructions, year should be "Not Listed".

The title comes from the section headers: "Broadcast and CAR: Quick hits and visuals". That seems appropriate.

Description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet provides quick resources for investigative reporters dealing with breaking news, so I'll craft a concise summary reflecting that.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking through the content, "investigative reporting", "breaking news", "CAR", "broadcast journalism", and "quick resources" are relevant and fit within the limit.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, since there's no year listed, that field remains as "Not Listed".

Putting it all together, I'll structure each key with appropriate values based on the input and guidelines provided.
