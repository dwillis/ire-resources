Okay, so I'm trying to create a JSON object based on the user's query. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, the response should only be a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 4696. 

Looking at the input, it seems to be a tipsheet from an IRE conference, specifically NICAR 2016 in Denver. So the conference is NICAR and the year is 2016.

The title of the tipsheet is "Risks and Rewards of Rolling Your Own Criminal Justice Data."

Now, for the authors. The user mentioned several projects with authors listed:
1. USA Today's project by Jodi Upton (@jodiupton)
2. The Guardian's project by Kenan Davis (@kenandavis)
3. Washington Post's project, author is @dataeditor
4. The Marshall Project by Gabriel Dance (@gabrieldance) and Ultra Casual (@ultracasual)

So each of these authors should be in the authors array. Each entry needs name, email, and affiliation. Since there are no emails provided, those will be null. Affiliation should be the news organization if mentioned. For example, Jodi Upton is affiliated with USA Today.

Next, the description. It needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. The tipsheet discusses the challenges and benefits of creating one's own criminal justice data, highlighting issues like data accuracy and the efforts by various news organizations.

Keywords should be up to five terms related to the topic, excluding conference and authors. So, "criminal justice," "data collection," "journalism," "police shootings," and "mass killings" seem appropriate.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part accordingly, making sure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes.
