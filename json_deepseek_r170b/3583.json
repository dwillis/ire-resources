Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided query. The user has given me specific instructions about what each key should contain.

First, the id should be 3583 as specified. 

Next, for authors, there are three names: Russ Baker, Carolyn Edds, and Niels Heimeriks. Niels has an email and affiliation listed, so I'll include those. The others don't have emails or affiliations mentioned, so their entries will have nulls.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE" in Orlando on 6/11/2011, so the year is 2011.

The title of the tipsheet is "Digging for Information."

For the description, I'll summarize the content. It's about backgrounding individuals using public records and other resources, highlighting steps like identify, reconstruct, and check.

Keywords should be relevant and up to five terms. I'll choose "backgrounding," "public records," "investigative research," "individual research," and "journalism."

I need to structure all of this correctly in JSON format with proper quoting and syntax.

    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
