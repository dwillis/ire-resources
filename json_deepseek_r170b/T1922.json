Alright, let me try to work through this step by step. The user has provided a detailed tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference titled "CDC 101" presented by Maryn McKenna. My task is to convert this information into a specific JSON object with predefined keys.

First, I need to identify the required fields: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as T1922, so that's straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors section. The tipsheet mentions Maryn McKenna from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution with her email provided. So, I'll create an author object with her name, email, and affiliation as the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. There are no other authors mentioned, so the list will only have this one entry.

For the conference, since it's about CDC 101 and presented by an investigative reporter, it makes sense that this is from an IRE conference. The year isn't explicitly stated in the provided text, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

The title is clearly given as "CDC 101". Now, the description needs to be a concise summary of what the tipsheet covers. It discusses the CDC's role in public health, its structure, history, and how reporters can effectively cover it. So, I'll craft a 1-2 sentence summary capturing that essence.

Regarding keywords, I need up to five relevant terms excluding conference and authors. The content revolves around the CDC, public health reporting, so keywords like "CDC", "public health", "government agencies", "investigative journalism", and "research access" seem appropriate.

Putting it all together, I structure each part carefully ensuring all data is correctly mapped without adding any extra information beyond what's provided.
