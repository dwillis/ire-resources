Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. Let me read through the instructions carefully.

The user provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference titled "22 Harvest Street" by Tisha Thompson. The response needs to include specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, I'll set the id as 5511 since that's specified. Next, for authors, there's only one author mentionedâ€”Tisha Thompson with her email and affiliation at ESPN. So, the authors list will have one object with her details.

The conference is clearly IRE, so I'll note that. The year isn't provided in the text, so it should be "Not Listed". The title is straightforward from the tipsheet: "22 Harvest Street".

For the description, I need a 1-2 sentence summary. The content describes a violent attack with surveillance videos and evidence photos, focusing on Niko Kollias's experience. So, the description will summarize that.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Relevant keywords from the text are "Violent Attack", "Surveillance Video", "Crime Investigation", "Multiplatform Storytelling", and "Evidence Photos".

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes, with no markdown formatting as per the user's request.

Let me double-check each part: id is correct, authors have the necessary details, conference is IRE, year is not listed. Title matches, description is concise, and keywords are relevant without exceeding five terms.

I think that covers everything. Time to structure it into JSON.
