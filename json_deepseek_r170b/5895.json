Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to create a JSON object based on the user's query. The user provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference, specifically mentioning IRE19. They want the response to be only a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, I'll note that the id is given as 5895. Next, for authors, there's a list of panelists from different universities and centers. Each author should have name, email, and affiliation. The names are provided, so I can extract them. Emails and affiliations are also listed next to each name, except for Sarah Cohen, who only has her name and email. So, I'll include those as they are.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE because it's part of the panel title "IRE19 New investigative centers: The university model." The year isn't explicitly mentioned beyond the event being labeled IRE19, so I'll default to "Not Listed" since it's not a four-digit year. 

For the title, it should be the main topic of the tipsheet. Looking at the content, it's about collaborating with students for investigative journalism, so I can summarize that as the title.

The description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. The text talks about planning ahead and involving students in various tasks like public records requests and data analysis while ensuring they have tangible outputs for their portfolios. So, my description should capture these points succinctly.

Keywords are next. I need up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking through the content, relevant keywords might be collaboration, academic partnerships, investigative journalism education, student projects, and public records requests. But wait, I shouldn't exceed five, so perhaps "collaboration," "academic partnerships," "investigative reporting," "student training," and "public records."

Now, putting it all together in JSON format with proper syntax, making sure each key is enclosed in quotes and the structure is correct.
