Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The user provided specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, looking at the input, the id is given as 6017. That’s straightforward.

Next, for authors: Martin Shelton from Freedom of the Press Foundation is mentioned. His email isn't listed, so it'll be null, and his affiliation is clear.

The conference is IRE since that's part of the tipsheet context. The year is July 2020, which can be inferred from the edition date provided.

The title should be concise, maybe "Encrypted Communications for Beginners."

For description, I need a short summary in simple terms. It’s about using encrypted channels and protecting device security.

Keywords: encryption, metadata, Signal, Wire, Jitsi Meet seem relevant.

I have to make sure all values are in English, enclosed in quotes, and keys match exactly as specified.
