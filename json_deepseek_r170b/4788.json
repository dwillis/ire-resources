Alright, I'm trying to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from Rob Barry's presentation at an IRE conference. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the ID is straightforward: 4788 as specified. Next, the authors section. The only author mentioned is Rob Barry, and his affiliation is clearly listed as "Wall Street Journal." His email isn't provided, so that will be null. 

The conference is identified as IRE since the tipsheet mentions it's from an IRE event. However, the year isn't explicitly stated anywhere in the text, so I'll mark that as "Not Listed."

For the title, it's given at the top: "Digging deeper with data and documents." The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers using data and documents in investigative journalism, so I'll summarize that it helps journalists find stories through data analysis.

Keywords should be relevant and limited to five. The main topics are data analysis, investigative journalism, documents, storytelling with data, and Medicare fraud. These capture the essence without including the conference or author names.

Putting it all together, each part is filled out accurately based on the provided information.
