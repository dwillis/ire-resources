Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided document. Let's go through each step carefully.

First, the user specified that the id should be 5235. So, I'll start with that.

Next, looking at the authors. The text lists several reporters from the Palm Beach Post, including Pat Beall, Mike Stucka, Lawrence Mower, Christine Stapleton, Joe Capozzi, and Joel Engelhardt. Each has an email and affiliation. Since their affiliations aren't explicitly stated but they're with a news organization, I'll use "Palm Beach Post" for each.

The conference is either IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed. The document mentions it's from the 2016 IRE Conference, so the conference key will be "IRE".

For the year, it's clearly listed as 2016 in the document.

The title needs to reflect the content. The tipsheet seems focused on investigative reporting related to opioid crises and sober homes, so a suitable title is "Investigating the Opioid Crisis: Tracking Costs, Sober Homes and Fatalities."

The description should be a concise summary. It talks about how to track costs of addiction treatment and link sober homes to overdoses, so I'll phrase it as such.

Keywords are limited to five terms. Relevant ones include "opioid crisis," "sober homes," "overdose tracking," "addiction treatment costs," and "investigative reporting techniques."

Putting it all together, I structure each part into the JSON format with proper syntax.
