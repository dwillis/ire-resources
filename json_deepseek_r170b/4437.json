Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided specific instructions, so I should follow them carefully.

First, the id is fixed at 4437. Got that. Next, authors are listed with name, email, and affiliation. Looking through the text, there are four panelists: Joel Engelhardt from Palm Beach Post, Shawn McIntosh from Atlanta Journal-Constitution, John Walton from BBC News, and moderator David Armstrong from Georgia News Lab.

For each author, I need to extract their details. Joel's email is listed as JEngelhardt@pbpost.com, so his affiliation is clear. Same with Shawn McIntosh at smcintosh@ajc.com, affiliated with AJC. John Walton's email is john.walton.02@bbc.co.uk, so BBC News is correct for him. David Armstrong's email is david.armstrong@georgianewslab.org, so Georgia News Lab is his affiliation.

The conference is NICAR because the hashtag #NICAR15 is present in the tipsheet. The year should be 2015 since that's what the 15 stands for in NICAR15.

Title of the session is "Editing the Data Story" as mentioned early on. For the description, I need a concise summary. It covers launching, bulletproofing, presentation, and Q&A for data stories. So the description should capture these elements in one or two sentences.

Keywords are next. The main points are accuracy, bulletproofing, data analysis, data visualization, and editorial process. These are all relevant terms from the content.

Now, putting it all together into a JSON structure with the specified keys: id, authors (as an array of objects), conference, year, title, description, keywords. Each field should be properly quoted, and emails shouldn't have any typos. Also, ensure that all values are in English as per instructions.
