Alright, I need to help the user by creating a JSON object based on their query. The user provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. My task is to extract specific information and structure it into the required JSON format.

First, I'll identify the ID which is given as 4750. Next, I need to find the authors. Looking at the input, there are two presenters: @MISTYMONTANO from 9NEWS in Denver and @DOUGHADDIX from Kiplinger Program at Ohio State University. So, their names are Misty Montano and Doug Haddix. Their affiliations are clear, so I'll include those.

The conference is mentioned as "IRE" since it's from Investigative Reporters and Editors. The year isn't specified in the text, so I'll set that to "Not Listed".

For the title, I see "DIG DEEPER WITH SOCIAL MEDIA", which seems appropriate. The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers various social media tools for investigative journalism, so I'll phrase it accordingly.

Keywords should include terms like "social media investigation", "Facebook", "Reddit", etc., up to five relevant ones excluding the conference and authors.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, any missing information like email addresses should be null as per instructions.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each key with the correct data, making sure not to invent any details and follow the user's formatting strictly.
