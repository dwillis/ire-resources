Alright, I need to help the user create a JSON object from their input following specific guidelines. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, the JSON should have keys like id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is given as 4816, so that's straightforward.

Looking at the authors section: it's a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. The user provided Ben Poston from Los Angeles Times with his email. So I'll structure that correctly, making sure to use null where information isn't available.

The conference is either IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed. Since the input mentions "Investigative Reporters and Editors conferences," it's definitely an IRE event.

For the year, the user didn't specify, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed."

The title should capture the essence of the presentation. The talk is about flawed UCR data in two cities, so a concise title would be fitting.

The description needs to be 1-2 sentences summarizing the content. It's about how crime misclassification affects statistics and public perception, so I'll condense that.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Aggravated assault, UCR data, crime classification, police data integrity, and data accuracy seem relevant here.

I also need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes without any markdown formatting as per the user's request.
