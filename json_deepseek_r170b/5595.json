Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The input provided includes various search terms for human disasters, Twitter operators, tools like Hoaxy and Botometer, and some contact information. 

First, I'll identify the required keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The id is given as 5595, so that's straightforward.

For authors, the input mentions "DOUG@IRE.ORG" and a Twitter handle "@DOUGHADDIX", which suggests the author's name might be Doug Haddix. However, since the name isn't explicitly provided, I should set it to null. The email is clearly listed as DOUG@IRE.ORG, and the affiliation would be IRE since that's part of the email.

The conference is IRE because the email and Twitter handle are associated with IRE events.

Looking for the year, the input doesn't specify any dates or years related to the conference, so I'll set it to "Not Listed".

The title should reflect the content. The tipsheet includes search terms and tools for covering human disasters on social media, so a suitable title would be "Investigating Human Disasters on Social Media".

The description needs to be concise. It's about using specific search terms and tools like Hoaxy to monitor social media during crises.

For keywords, I'll extract relevant terms: "human disasters", "social media monitoring", "search terms", "Hoaxy", and "Twitter". These are all within the limit of five and exclude conference and authors.

Putting it all together, each part is mapped correctly without making up any information. If something isn't specified, like the author's name, I leave it as null.
