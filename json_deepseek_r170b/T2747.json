Okay, so I have to create a JSON object based on the provided text. Let me go through this step by step.

First, I need to identify the 'id', which is given as T2747. That's straightforward.

Next, the 'authors' section. Looking at the text, there are mentions of Roger L. and other names like Mark Horvit, but they aren't clearly listed as authors. Since the main speaker seems to be Roger L., I'll set his name with null email and affiliation. The others mentioned don't have enough info, so I'll leave them out.

The 'conference' is specified as NICAR, which stands for National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting. That makes sense given the context of data journalism.

The 'year' isn't explicitly stated in the text, so it should be "Not Listed".

For the 'title', the main topic is about police decertification and databases, so I'll summarize that as the title.

The 'description' needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary. It's about the lack of a national database for bad cops moving between states and the need for better tracking.

Now, 'keywords'. The important terms are police decertification, officer misconduct, National Decertification Database (NDD), National Practitioner Databank, and police unions. I'll list these as keywords, making sure not to exceed five.

Putting it all together, I structure each part carefully, ensuring no made-up data and that everything is correctly formatted in JSON.
