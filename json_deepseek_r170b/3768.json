Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The user provided specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, I'll start by identifying the id, which is given as 3768. Next, for authors, there's Joe Bergantino from the New England Center for Investigative Reporting. Since only his name and affiliation are present, email will be null.

The conference is clearly IRE, so that's straightforward. The year isn't mentioned in the text, so it should be "Not Listed". The title is "The Business of Training".

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet covers planning, partnerships, costs, and revenue growth for training programs, so I'll phrase it simply.

Keywords should be up to five terms related to the content: "training", "business planning", "university partnerships", "cost analysis", and "revenue growth".

I have to make sure all values are in English and keys are enclosed in quotes. No markdown, just plain JSON.
