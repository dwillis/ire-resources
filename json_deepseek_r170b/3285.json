Okay, so I need to create a JSON object from the provided input. Let me first read through everything carefully.

The input starts with June 11, 2009, and mentions an Investigative Reporters and Editors Annual Conference in Baltimore. So that gives me the conference name as "IRE" and the year is clearly listed as 2009.

Looking at the authors section, I see four people: Joe Bergantino, Maggie Mulvihill, David Cohn, and Andy Hall. Each has an email and an affiliation. For example, Joe's email is jbergant@bu.edu and his affiliation is New England Center for Investigative Reporting. Similarly for the others. So I can list each author with their name, email, and affiliation.

The title of the tipsheet is "Building Investigative Centers: Getting Through the First Year". That seems clear from the input.

For the description, it's a bit longer, but I need to summarize it in 1-2 sentences. The main points are building a strong framework before starting, establishing identity through branding and networking, managing operations, adapting to challenges, and staying focused on long-term goals. So maybe something like: "A guide for establishing and sustaining investigative journalism centers, focusing on strategic planning, operational management, and adaptability."

Keywords should be up to five terms. Looking at the content, relevant terms are "investigative journalism", "nonprofit management", "start-ups", "fundraising", and "strategic planning". I'll list these in lowercase.

I also need to make sure that all values are enclosed in quotes and keys are properly formatted. Since the conference is clearly stated as IRE and the year is 2009, those fields are straightforward.

Now, putting it all together into a JSON structure with the specified keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The ID given is 3285.
