Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let's break down the requirements step by step.

First, the structure should have specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 2934. Next, authors need to be a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. I see Ken Ward Jr. is listed with his contact info, so that's straightforward.

The conference is IRE since it's explicitly mentioned in the text. The year is 2007 from the date provided. For the title, "Covering Worker Safety and Health" makes sense as it encapsulates the main topic.

Now, the description should be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers investigating workplace injuries, using data sources like OSHA, MSHA, and BLS. It also mentions FOIA requests and talking to workers. So I'll condense that into one or two sentences focusing on strategies for journalists investigating worker safety issues.

Keywords need to be relevant and limited to five. From the content, "worker safety," "OSHA," "investigative journalism," "FOIA requests," and "occupational health" are all key terms.

I should ensure all values are in English and correctly formatted with quotes. Also, since Ken Ward Jr.'s affiliation is The Charleston Gazette, that goes into his author object.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, making sure each field aligns with the instructions provided.
