Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given input from NICAR 2016 titled "THE CYCLE OF A NEWS APP." The user provided specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, the id is straightforward: it's 4729. 

Next, for authors, the text includes a panel with Jacquima Her. So I'll set her name as "Jacquima Her" and since there's no email or affiliation mentioned, those will be null. Also, Mike Rastiello is quoted, but he isn't part of the authors list; he's just a speaker.

The conference is NICAR because it's from the NICAR 2016 event. The year is clearly stated as 2016.

For the title, it's "THE CYCLE OF A NEWS APP."

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet discusses what constitutes a news app and its lifecycle, including development and management challenges. So I'll write that in simple terms.

Keywords should be up to five relevant terms excluding conference and authors. Looking at the content, "news app," "interactive journalism," "content management system (CMS)," and "digital storytelling" fit well.

I need to make sure all keys are in English and enclosed in quotes without any markdown.
