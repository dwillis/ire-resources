Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's instructions. The input provided is about a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference titled "10 Databases For Covering City Hall" by David Herzog.

First, I'll start by identifying each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

The id is given as T1986. 

Next, the authors section should be a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. The input only mentions David Herzog, so his entry will have his name. Email isn't provided, so it'll be null. His affiliation is listed as NICAR & Missouri School of Journalism, which I can use directly.

For conference, since the tipsheet is from an IRE conference, that's straightforward.

The year isn't mentioned in the input, so I'll set it to "Not Listed".

The title is clearly given as "10 Databases For Covering City Hall".

Now, the description needs a concise 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet discusses various databases like Personnel, Payroll, Budgets, etc., which help journalists cover city government activities. So I'll summarize that.

Lastly, keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, "City Hall", "Databases", "Government Accountability", "Journalism Resources", and "Investigative Reporting" are relevant and fit within the limit.

Putting it all together, I structure each part into the JSON object as per the instructions.
