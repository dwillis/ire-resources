Alright, I'm looking at this query where the user provided some Prezi slides titled "Weathering the Storm" by Stephen Stirling. They want me to create a JSON object for an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) tipsheet based on that input.

First, the id should be 4094_1 as specified. The authors section needs to include each author with name, email, and affiliation. Here, only Stephen Stirling is mentioned without an email or affiliation, so I'll list him with nulls for those fields.

Next, determining the conference: since it's about investigative journalism and presented by someone likely from that field, I'm assuming it's an IRE conference. The year isn't explicitly stated, but the slides are dated March 26, 2014, so I can confidently set the year to 2014.

The title is straightforwardâ€” "Weathering the Storm". For the description, I need a concise summary. The transcript mentions that anything you want is available in real-time, which suggests it's about using real-time data for journalism. So, the description should reflect that.

Keywords are limited to five terms, excluding conference and authors. Real-time data, investigative journalism, transparency, efficiency, and accountability seem fitting based on the context.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with these values, ensuring all keys are in quotes and proper formatting is maintained.
