Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me break down the steps.

First, the user provided a detailed text which includes speaker information, session title, and various tips for managing investigative stories. My task is to parse this information into specific fields: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The id is given as 3510, so that's straightforward. 

Next, I need to extract the authors. There are three speakers listed: Blake Morrison, Joel Engelhardt, and Rose Ciotta. Each has their name, email, and affiliation. I'll structure each author with these attributes. For example, Blake Morrison's email is bmorrison@usatoday.com and his affiliation is USA Today.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE National Conference, so the value for "conference" will be "IRE". The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the provided text, so according to instructions, it should be "Not Listed".

The title of the session is "Managers: Bulletproofing the story". 

For the description, I need a concise 1-2 sentence summary. Looking at the content, the session focuses on best practices for managing investigative projects, covering phases from start to finish and emphasizing thoroughness and legal considerations.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Relevant keywords here would include "investigative reporting", "project management", "editorial standards", "legal review", and "data analysis".

Putting it all together, I structure the JSON with these values, ensuring each key is properly quoted and the data aligns correctly.
