Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me break down the requirements step by step.

First, I'll start by identifying each key needed: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

The id is given as T2708, so that's straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors section. The user provided information about Dave Moore from the Dallas Business Journal. His email and phone number are listed, so I can include his name, email, and affiliation. Since there are no other authors mentioned, the authors list will only have one entry.

For the conference, it's clearly stated as "Investigative Editors & Reporters conference," which I know is associated with IRE, so I'll set conference to "IRE".

The year is specified as June 15-18, 2006, so the year key should be 2006.

The title of the tipsheet is "Stretching your resources to do investigations", which I'll include verbatim.

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The main idea is about using databases and expert sources to enhance reporting despite limited resources. I'll phrase it simply to meet the requirement.

For keywords, I need up to five terms excluding conference and authors. The relevant terms here are "investigative journalism", "databases", "resource management", "expert sources", and "reporting tips".

I should ensure all values are in English and properly quoted. Also, since the year is clearly listed, it's not "Not Listed".

Putting it all together, I structure each key with appropriate values, making sure authors is an array of objects with name, email, and affiliation. Since Dave Moore's phone isn't needed, I can ignore it.

Finally, I'll review to ensure no made-up names are included and that all data aligns with the user's instructions.
