Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions, so I have to make sure each part is addressed correctly.

First, I notice that the id should be 2911. That's straightforward. Next, looking at the authors section: there's Rose Ciotta listed with her email and affiliation as The Philadelphia Inquirer. Since only one author is mentioned, the authors list will have just one object with her details. If there were more authors, I'd add them accordingly.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, which took place in Phoenix in 2007. So, the year is 2007. The title of the tipsheet is "Making CAR stories sing." Now, for the description, it needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet provides advice on writing and editing data-driven stories, so I'll phrase that into one or two sentences.

Keywords are next. I should pick up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking through the content, "CAR reporting," "data journalism," "writing tips," "story structure," and "investigative reporting" seem relevant.

I also need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. No markdown, just plain JSON. I'll double-check each field to make sure there's no made-up information and that everything aligns with the user's instructions.
