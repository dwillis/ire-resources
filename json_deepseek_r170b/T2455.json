Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided input. Let me start by understanding what's required.

First, the structure needs specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as T2455. 

Looking at the input, there's an author named Joel Grover from KNBC-TV Los Angeles with his email. So under authors, I'll have a list with one object containing name, email, and affiliation. Since the affiliation isn't explicitly stated next to his name but he works for KNBC-TV, that becomes his affiliation.

The conference is either IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed. The input doesn't specify which conference this tipsheet is from, so it should be "Not Listed". 

The year isn't mentioned in the provided text, so I'll set that to "Not Listed" as well.

For the title, the input has two parts: "THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX---DOING BIGGER, BETTER INVESTIGATIONS" and "Create a JSON object from the input". Wait, actually, looking back, the first line is the tipsheet's title. So the main title should be "Thinking Outside the Box—Doing Bigger, Better Investigations".

The description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. The tipsheet emphasizes innovative approaches and thorough storytelling. So I'll summarize that.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the text, relevant keywords include investigative journalism, storytelling, innovation, newsroom collaboration, and visual elements.

Putting it all together, I structure each key accordingly, making sure everything is in quotes and proper JSON syntax.
