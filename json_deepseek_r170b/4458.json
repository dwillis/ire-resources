Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conferences. Let's break down each requirement step by step.

First, the id is straightforwardâ€”it should be 4458 as specified. Next, looking at the authors section: the original text mentions "@MeganLuther @IRE_NICAR". Megan Luther is a clear author name, while IRE_NICAR is likely an organization or conference handle, not another person. So, authors will have one object with name "Megan Luther" and her email and affiliation as null since no further details are provided.

The conference is either IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed. Since the tipsheet is from IRE, it should be listed as such. The year is noted at the top as 2015, so that's set under "year".

For the title, it's "Web for Watchdogs", clearly stated at the beginning. The description needs to be a concise summary of the content. The tipsheet covers various search techniques and tools useful for investigative journalism, so I'll phrase it to reflect that.

Keywords are next. Looking through the document, key terms include advanced search techniques, people searching tools like Pipl and PeekYou, alternative search engines such as DuckDuckGo and Blekko, property records, and social media monitoring tools like SocialMention. I'll select up to five relevant keywords: "advanced search", "people search", "alternative search engines", "property records", and "social media".

I should ensure all values are in English since the original text is in English. Each key and value must be enclosed in quotes, so I'll structure the JSON accordingly.

Putting it all together, each section is addressed as per the user's instructions without making up any information or adding extra data beyond what's provided.
