Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The tipsheet is titled "Broadcast Track: Visual Storytelling" and includes sections like "Opening Shots – The Long Shot," "Rock Solid Center – Quality Visual Content," and "Finishing Touches – The Polished Product."

First, I'll identify the key elements required in the JSON object. The keys needed are id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

Starting with the id: it's given as 5702.

Next, authors. From the tipsheet, Anna Hewson is listed with her affiliation KUSA. Brendan Keefe is from WXIA, and Andy Miller is mentioned without an explicit affiliation but works for Raycom Media as the Executive Producer of Investigations. So each author entry should include their name, email (which isn't provided here), and affiliation.

The conference is clearly IRE since it's about Investigative Reporters and Editors conferences.

The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the text, so I'll set it to "Not Listed."

The title of the tipsheet is straightforward: "Broadcast Track: Visual Storytelling: A New Perspective."

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet covers visual storytelling techniques using drones, multi-camera setups, lighting, and effective editing. So the description should capture these elements in 1-2 sentences.

Keywords are next. They should be relevant to the content but not include the conference or authors' names. Appropriate keywords could be "visual storytelling," "broadcast journalism," "investigative reporting," "multi-camera techniques," and "storytelling techniques."

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part carefully, ensuring that emails and affiliations are correctly assigned where possible. Since some details like emails aren't provided, they'll remain null.

I need to make sure the JSON syntax is correct: keys in quotes, proper use of commas, and square brackets for arrays. Each author object should be within an array under "authors."

Finally, I'll review the JSON to ensure all data from the tipsheet is accurately represented without adding any made-up information.
