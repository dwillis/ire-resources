Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors conference. The user provided specific instructions about what each key should contain.

First, the id is set to 3011 as instructed. Next, for authors, I see Andy Hall's details are present, including his email and affiliation with the Wisconsin State Journal. There might be other authors mentioned, but looking at the text, it seems only Andy Hall is listed, so the authors array has just one object.

The conference is clearly stated as "Investigative Reporters and Editors," which I'll abbreviate as "IRE." The year is given as 2007 from the date provided. 

For the title, it's "First Day on the Beat: Investigating Cities and County Government." The description needs to be a concise summary. I'll mention that it provides strategies for journalists covering local government and neighborhood issues.

Keywords should exclude the conference and authors but include relevant terms like "neighborhood reporting," "local government," "investigative journalism," etc., keeping it to five.

I think that's all covered. Now, just structure everything into JSON with proper syntax.
