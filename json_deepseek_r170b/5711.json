Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The user has provided specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, I'll start by extracting the relevant information from the given text. The ID is 5711 as per the user's instruction. The conference is clearly stated as IRE in Orlando, June 16, 2018, so that fills in the conference and year fields.

Next, looking at the panelists: Bente Birkeland, Jim Brunner, and Joel Ebert. Each has an email and a Twitter handle, but no affiliations are mentioned in the text. Since their emails have domains like krcc.org, seattletimes.com, and tennessean.com, I can infer their affiliations from those. So Bente is with KRCC, Jim with Seattle Times, and Joel with The Tennessean.

The title of the tipsheet seems to be about localizing investigations into sexual misconduct. The description needs to be a concise summary in simple language. It should mention that it's a tipsheet offering strategies for investigative journalists covering sexual misconduct cases, including sourcing, document use, and handling challenges.

For keywords, I need up to five terms excluding the conference and authors' names. Relevant terms here would be "sexual misconduct," "investigative journalism," "source interviewing," "document analysis," and "journalistic ethics."

I should make sure that all keys are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. The authors array needs each panelist's details, with name, email, and affiliation correctly filled out. Since the user specified not to make up names, I only include what's provided.

Putting it all together, the JSON structure should accurately reflect the tipsheet's content as per the guidelines given.
