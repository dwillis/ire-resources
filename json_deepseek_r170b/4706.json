Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conferences. The user provided specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, I'll start with the "id" which is given as 4706. That's straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors section. The tipsheet mentions Justin Myers, who works at The Associated Press. His email isn't listed, so I'll set it to null. Since he's affiliated with AP, that goes into his affiliation field. There are no other authors mentioned, so the authors list has only one entry.

For the conference, the user specified that it should be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". The tipsheet is from IRE, so I'll set that.

The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the text, so I'll default to "Not Listed".

The title of the session is clearly stated as "Bot Building 101: Tools and Techniques for Newsroom Automation." That's perfect for the title field.

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers various tools like IFTTT alternatives (Dexter, Huginn), conversation bots (Hubot, Lita), and other coding solutions (cron, forever). So, I'll summarize that it introduces tools and techniques for automating tasks in newsrooms.

Keywords should be up to five relevant terms. From the content, "Automation", "Newsroom Tools", "Bot Development", "Huginn", and "Hubot" are key terms. These exclude the conference name and authors as per instructions.

Putting it all together, I ensure each key is enclosed in quotes and that the structure follows proper JSON formatting.
