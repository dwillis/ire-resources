Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. The input provided is about web scraping tools presented at a conference. Let me go through each key step by step.

First, the id should be 3649 as specified. Next, for authors, since none are listed in the text, it'll be an empty list with nulls for name, email, and affiliation.

The conference isn't explicitly mentioned as IRE or NICAR, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed". The year is also not provided, so that's another "Not Listed".

For the description, I need a concise summary. The text discusses various web scraping tools for non-programmers, emphasizing ethical practices and when to move to programming.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Relevant terms are web scraping, tools, data extraction, ethics, and non-programmers.

I'll structure all these into the JSON object as specified.

```json
{
  "id": 3649,
  "authors": [],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Web Scraping Tools for Non-Programmers",
  "description": "This text discusses various web scraping tools available for non-programmers, including their features and ethical considerations.",
  "keywords": ["web scraping", "tools", "data extraction", "ethics", "non-programmers"]
}
```
