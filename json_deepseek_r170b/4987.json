Okay, so I'm trying to create a JSON object from the input provided by the user. Let me break down what they've asked for.

First, the structure needs to have specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 4987. Next, the authors should be a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. They mentioned not to make up names and leave them null if none are provided. Also, if a news organization is mentioned, use that as the affiliation.

Looking at the input text, it's about various ways journalists can investigate college athletics through different data sources and methods. There are tips on using public records, financial documents like IRS Form 990, NCAA data, etc. I don't see any specific authors or affiliations listed in the text provided, so the authors list will be empty with nulls.

The conference key should be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Since the input references IREâ€™s story database and other IRE-related content, it makes sense to categorize this under the "IRE" conference. 

For the year, there's no specific mention of when this information was presented or published, so I'll set that to "Not Listed".

The title should capture the essence of the document, something like "Investigating College Athletics: A Guide for Journalists".

The description needs to be a concise summary in 1-2 sentences. It should explain that it's a guide for journalists investigating college sports through public records and financial data.

Lastly, keywords are up to five terms. From the content, relevant keywords could be "college athletics", "investigative journalism", "public records", "financial transparency", and "data journalism".

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part accordingly, ensuring that all values are in English and properly quoted.
