Alright, so I need to help this user create a JSON object based on their tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down the requirements.

First, the structure: id is given as 4282. Authors should be a list with each having name, email, and affiliation. The example only mentions Nancy Amons with her email and affiliation as WSMV-TV Nashville. So I'll include her details and leave others as null since there are no additional authors.

Conference is definitely "IRE" because it's from their conference. Year isn't provided in the text, so it should be "Not Listed". The title is clear: "Quick-Hit Investigations: Daily Deadlines Don't Mean Dull Stories".

For description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about digging deeper on breaking stories and using resources like Hotlinks for quick investigations. So summarizing that into 1-2 sentences should work.

Keywords are up to five terms. Looking at the content, "investigative journalism", "breaking news", "public records", "Hotlinks", and "story leads" seem relevant. These capture the essence without including conference or author names.

I need to ensure all keys and values are in quotes and use correct JSON syntax. No markdown, just plain JSON. I'll structure it step by step to make sure nothing's missed.

```json
{
  "id": 4282,

    {
      "name": "Nancy Amons",
      "email": "namons@wsmv.com",
      "affiliation": "WSMV-TV Nashville"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Quick-Hit Investigations: Daily Deadlines Don't Mean Dull Stories",
  "description": "This tipsheet provides strategies for conducting quick and effective investigations under daily deadlines, emphasizing the use of public records, organization tools, and simple storytelling techniques.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative journalism",
    "breaking news",
    "public records",
    "Hotlinks",
    "story leads"
  ]
}
