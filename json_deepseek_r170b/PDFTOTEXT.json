Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let's break down what each part requires.

First, the `id` is straightforwardâ€”PDFTOTEXT as given. 

Next, for `authors`, there are two authors listed: Jeff Porter with email jeff@ire.org and affiliation IRE and NICAR, and another author whose name isn't provided but is affiliated with IRE. So, one entry has all details, the other has null for name and only affiliation.

The `conference` should be "IRE" since that's explicitly mentioned. 

Since there's no year in the text, it'll be "Not Listed".

The `title` is clear: "How to use PDFTOTEXT to convert PDFs into text".

For the `description`, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet teaches converting PDFs to text using pdftotext, so that fits.

Keywords should be relevant terms excluding conference and authors. I'll go with ["PDF", "pdftotext", "data conversion", "text extraction", "Excel import"].

Putting it all together, ensuring correct syntax and structure.

```json
{
  "id": "PDFTOTEXT",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Jeff Porter",
      "email": "jeff@ire.org",
      "affiliation": "IRE and NICAR"
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "IRE"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "How to use PDFTOTEXT to convert PDFs into text",
  "description": "This tipsheet provides instructions on using the pdftotext tool to convert PDF files into text format and importing the data into Excel for analysis.",
  "keywords": ["PDF", "pdftotext", "data conversion", "text extraction", "Excel import"]
}
