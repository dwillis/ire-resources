Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the user has given me a specific structure to follow with keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is already specified as 4767, so that's straightforward.

Looking at the tipsheet, I see it's titled "Donâ€™t Let the Bots Win" by Liam Andrew and Daniel Craigmile. Their Twitter handles are provided, but since the user mentioned not to make up names and only include what's listed, their emails and affiliations remain null unless specified. The affiliation should be based on any news organization mentioned, which in this case isn't present, so they stay null.

The conference is NICAR, which stands for the National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting, a part of IRE. Since the year isn't explicitly mentioned, it'll be "Not Listed".

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet discusses how bots impact websites and how to manage them respectfully. So, a 1-2 sentence summary would capture that essence.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Relevant keywords here are bots, web scraping, robots.txt, user-agent, and crawl management.

I'll structure all these into the JSON format as per instructions, ensuring each value is in English and properly quoted.

    }
  ],
