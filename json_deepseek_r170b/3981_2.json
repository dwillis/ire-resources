Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, looking at the input, the title is "Income inequality: A journalistâ€™s guide." That's clear. The conference is IRE annual in San Antonio, June 2013, so the conference key should be "IRE" and the year is 2013.

Next, for the authors, there's Paul Overberg from USA TODAY with his email provided. So the authors list will have one entry: name is "Paul Overberg," email is "poverberg@usatoday.com," and affiliation is "USA TODAY."

The description needs to be a concise summary in 1-2 sentences. The tipsheet discusses income inequality, its measurement, causes, effects, and provides resources for journalists. So I'll phrase that simply.

Keywords should be no more than five terms excluding conference or authors. Relevant keywords here are "income inequality," "journalism resources," "economic reporting," "social dispersion," and "educational attainment."

Putting it all together, I structure each key with proper values, ensuring strings are in quotes and the JSON syntax is correct.
