Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's input. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, the id should be 4606. That part is straightforward.

Next, authors is a list where each element has name, email, and affiliation. The original text doesn't mention any authors by name, so I'll set name to null. Similarly, there's no email or affiliation provided, so those will also be null.

The conference should be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Looking at the links, they're from 9news.com, which is a news organization. I don't see any mention of IRE or NICAR conferences here, so I'll go with "Not Listed" for conference.

For the year, since there are no dates in the provided text, it should be "Not Listed".

The title isn't explicitly given, but the links have titles like "Dept-of-Labor-director-helped-get-friend-142000-job", which refers to an investigation. So I'll use that as the title.

The description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. The investigations seem to cover various topics like labor issues and facility security, so I'll craft a brief summary about investigative reporting on these topics.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the links, relevant keywords are "Investigative Reporting", "Labor Department", "Facility Security", "Public Records".

I need to make sure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. No made-up names or affiliations; only use what's provided.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with these elements.

```json
{
  "id": "4606",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "9News"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigative Reports by 9News",
  "description": "A collection of investigative reports covering various topics including labor department actions, facility security breaches, and public ticketing issues.",
  "keywords": [
    "Investigative Reporting",
    "Labor Department",
    "Facility Security",
    "Public Records"
  ]
}
```
