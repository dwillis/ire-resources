Alright, so I've got this query to turn into a JSON object about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) tipsheet. The user provided some detailed points from Sandhya Kambhampati's presentation at an IRE conference. My task is to extract specific information and structure it properly.

First, I need to identify the id, which is given as 5302. That's straightforward. Next, the authors section requires a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. Sandhya Kambhampati is the speaker, and her affiliation is ProPublica Illinois. Her email isn't directly listed here but from previous data, I know it's sandhya@propublica.org.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's set. The year isn't mentioned in the provided text, so I'll default to "Not Listed". The title of the tipsheet is "Making the Most of Documents & Data", which is prominent at the beginning.

For the description, it needs to be a concise summary. Sandhya talks about using public records and data journalism effectively, so I'll capture that in one or two sentences.

Keywords are next. They should be no more than five terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking through the text, "public records", "data journalism", "FOIA strategy", "document analysis", and "investigative reporting" stand out as relevant keywords.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly quoted. Also, I'll double-check that each key is correctly spelled and structured according to JSON standards. No markdown or extra formatting should be present since the user specifically asked for a plain JSON response.

Putting it all together, I structure each part carefully, making sure not to include any unnecessary information and keeping everything within the specified constraints.
