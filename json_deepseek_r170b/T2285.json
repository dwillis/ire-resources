Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from George Watson of The Sun. Let me break down what each part should look like.

First, the id is T2285 as specified. Next, the authors section: there's only one author mentioned, George Watson. His email and affiliation are provided, so I'll include those.

For the conference, since it's from an IRE event, that goes in. The year isn't listed, so I'll put "Not Listed". The title is clearly "Wildfires Tip Sheet".

The description needs to be a concise summary. It should mention the project name and what resources are provided, so something like how they used interactive media and listed various online tools.

Keywords should include relevant terms without including the conference or authors. So wildfire, mapping tools, drought analysis, emergency response, and fire safety make sense here.

I'll structure all this into JSON with proper formatting.

```json
{
  "id": "T2285",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "George Watson",
      "email": "george.watson@sbsun.com",
      "affiliation": "The Sun"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Wildfires Tip Sheet",
  "description": "A comprehensive guide to resources and tools for reporting on wildfires, including mapping tools, drought analysis, emergency response, and fire safety.",
  "keywords": [
    "wildfire",
    "mapping tools",
    "drought analysis",
    "emergency response",
    "fire safety"
  ]
}
```
