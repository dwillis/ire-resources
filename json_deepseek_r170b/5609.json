Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the tipsheet provided from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through this step by step.

First, looking at the input, there's a slide titled "Digital Sleuthing on Deadline" presented by Denise Malan, with her email denise@ire.org and affiliation IRE. So, under authors, there should be one entry with name "Denise Malan", email "denise@ire.org", and affiliation "IRE".

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's straightforward. The year isn't mentioned in the text provided, so I'll set it to "Not Listed". 

For the title, the main heading is "Digital Sleuthing on Deadline". 

The description needs to be a concise summary of the content. The tipsheet covers strategies for effective online research, including search techniques, background checks, social media sleuthing, and tools for verification and archiving. So I can write something like: "Tips and strategies for journalists on conducting efficient digital research, including search techniques, verifying sources, and using specialized tools."

Now, the keywords should be up to five terms that capture the essence without repeating the conference or authors. Looking through the content, relevant terms might include "digital research", "investigative journalism", "online verification", "backgrounding sources", and "search strategies". These seem to cover the main topics.

I'll structure this into a JSON object with all the required keys: id, authors (as an array), conference, year, title, description, and keywords. Each value needs to be in English and enclosed in quotes. Since there's no explicit year, it remains "Not Listed".

Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The tipsheet includes various sections like thinking like a researcher, using checklists, verifying information, expanding searches, and specific tools for different areas like social media, images, etc. All of these are encapsulated in the keywords I've chosen.

Alright, putting it all together now.
