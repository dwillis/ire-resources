Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on this tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE). Let's see what information I have here.

First, the ID is given as Tipsheet #3400, so that will be straightforward. The authors listed are Bill Allison from the Sunlight Foundation, Wendell Cochran from American University, and Jonathan D. Salant from Bloomberg News. Since their emails aren't provided, those fields will remain null. I should make sure to structure each author with name, email, and affiliation correctly.

Next, the conference is clearly IRE because it's mentioned at the top of the document as being from Investigative Reporters and Editors. The year isn't explicitly stated in the text, so according to the instructions, I'll set it to "Not Listed".

For the title, it's "CAMPAIGN FINANCE: TRACKING THE MONEY". That seems clear enough.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet provides various resources and methods for tracking campaign finance data, including FEC filings, contributions from PACs, and tools from organizations like Sunlight Foundation and Center for Responsive Politics. So I'll condense that into one or two sentences.

Keywords should include terms relevant to the content but exclude the conference name and authors. Looking at the content, "campaign finance", "lobbying", "FEC", "PAC", and "transparency tools" are all key topics here.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly quoted. I'll structure each part step by step, making sure not to miss any required fields or include extra information beyond what's necessary.
