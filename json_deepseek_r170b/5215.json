Alright, I need to help the user create a JSON object based on their query. They provided a detailed set of instructions and an example response. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, the JSON should have specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is given as 5215, so that's straightforward.

Next, looking at the input text, I see mentions of "Julian Sher" with contact info including email and phone number, but no explicit mention of a news organization except CBC in his email. So for authors, it should be a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. Since only Julian Sher is mentioned, he'll be the sole entry. His email is provided, so that goes in. The affiliation isn't explicitly stated next to his name, but since his email is @cbc.ca, I can infer CBC as his affiliation.

The conference needs to be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Scanning through the text, there's a mention of ire.org events and tipsheets, which indicates it's related to IRE. So the conference should be "IRE".

For the year, the input includes "(2017)" in the tipsheet link, so that's clear.

The title is clearly stated as "The Art of Investigative Story-Telling" at the top.

The description needs a 1-2 sentence summary. The presentation focuses on storytelling techniques for investigative journalism, so I'll craft something concise around that.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the content, "investigative journalism", "storytelling techniques", "journalism tips", and "narrative structure" are relevant.

I need to ensure all values are in English unless otherwise specified. The original text is in English, so no issues there.

Now, structuring it all into JSON format with proper syntax, making sure each key is enclosed in quotes and the structure is correct.

```json

  "id": "5215",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Julian Sher",
      "email": "julian.sher@cbc.ca",
      "affiliation": "CBC"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2017",
  "title": "The Art of Investigative Story-Telling",
  "description": "A presentation on storytelling techniques for investigative journalism, focusing on character development, narrative structure, and research guidance.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative journalism",
    "storytelling techniques",
    "journalism tips",
    "narrative structure"
  ]
}
```
