Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about the IRE 2002 San Francisco conference tipsheet. Let me break this down.

First, I'll identify each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The id is given as T1601, so that's straightforward.

Looking at the authors section, Sofia Basso is listed with her email and affiliation Il Nuovo from Italy. So I'll structure the authors array with one object containing name, email, and affiliation.

Conference is clearly stated as IRE Annual Conference 2002 in San Francisco, so conference key will be "IRE".

The year is 2002, which is explicitly mentioned.

Title of the tipsheet is "EXPLOITATION OF WORKERS - INTERNET RESOURCES".

For the description, I need a concise summary. The main points are internet resources and tools for investigative journalists to find information on labor exploitation. So I'll phrase it as a 1-2 sentence summary.

Keywords should be relevant terms excluding conference and authors. From the content, "workers' rights", "labor exploitation", "internet resources", "investigative journalism" seem appropriate. I'll limit it to five, but in this case, four seems sufficient.

I need to ensure all values are in English unless original text is different, which they are here.

Now, putting it all together, I structure the JSON with each key properly enclosed and values accurately filled.
