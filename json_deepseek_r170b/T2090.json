Alright, so I need to help this user by creating a JSON object based on their query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) tipsheet. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, the user provided a detailed text from George Papajohn of the Chicago Tribune. They want this information structured into a specific JSON format with keys like id, authors, conference, year, etc. The id is given as T2090, so that's straightforward.

Looking at the author section, they mentioned not to make up names and to use null if none are provided. Here, George Papajohn is listed, but there's no email or affiliation beyond the Chicago Tribune. So I'll set his name and affiliation, leaving email as null since it's not provided.

The conference key should be "IRE" because the tipsheet is from an IRE event. The year isn't specified in the text, so I'll mark that as "Not Listed". 

For the description, they want a concise summary of 1-2 sentences. I'll need to capture the essence of managing reporters during projects, emphasizing team-building and support.

Keywords are next. I should pick up to five relevant terms, excluding the conference name and authors. Looking at the text, "project management", "team building", "journalism", "leadership", and "newsroom" seem appropriate.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part carefully, ensuring all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes as per JSON standards.
