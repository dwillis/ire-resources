Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to create this JSON object based on the user's query. Let me start by reading through the input they provided.

The input seems like a detailed guide for investigative business reporters, listing various resources and tips. It mentions books like "The Investigative Reporter’s Handbook" by Brant Houston, Len Bruzzese & Steve Weinberg, along with several websites such as www.ire.org, www.businessjournalism.org, and others.

First, I need to extract specific information: authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords, and so on. The user wants a JSON object with the id 3014. 

Looking at the input, there's no explicit mention of the conference name or the year of an event. So for the "conference" key, it should be "Not Listed", and similarly, the "year" will also be "Not Listed". 

The title is given as "Create a JSON object from the input..." but that seems more like an instruction rather than a title. Wait, no, actually, in the context, it's part of a query, so perhaps I need to extract the actual title from the content provided. The user mentions several books and resources, so maybe the main title is "The Investigative Reporter’s Handbook". But looking again, the input starts with that book as one of the recommended resources.

Wait, no, the entire text seems like a guide or resource list for business reporters, so perhaps the title should reflect that. Maybe something like "Guide to Investigating Businesses" or "Resources for Business Reporters".

Now, the authors: there are several mentioned, such as Brant Houston, Len Bruzzese & Steve Weinberg, Edward Iwata, James K. Gentry, Chris Roush, and Howard Schilit. Each of these should be in the authors list with their details. However, the user specified not to make up names; if none is listed, leave name as null. But since these are real people mentioned, we can include them.

For each author entry, I need to provide name, email, and affiliation. Emails aren't provided here, so they'll be null. Affiliations: some authors are associated with organizations like Bedford/St. Martin’s (publisher), IRE, etc. So for Brant Houston and his co-authors, since the book is published by Bedford/St. Martin’s, that can be their affiliation.

The description needs to be a concise summary of 1-2 sentences in simple language. It should capture the essence of the input text, which is about providing resources and tips for investigative business reporters.

Keywords are next—up to five terms excluding conference and authors. So from the content, keywords could include "investigative journalism", "business reporting", "journalism resources", "financial statements", etc.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part step by step, ensuring that all keys are present and correctly formatted. I need to make sure that the JSON syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotes.

I also have to remember not to include any made-up information and stick strictly to what's provided in the input. Since there’s no conference or year specified, those fields will be "Not Listed". Emails are null since they aren't mentioned, and affiliations are taken from the context where possible.

Let me outline each key:

- id: 3014
- authors: List of objects with name, email, affiliation.
  - Brant Houston: name is present; email null; affiliation Bedford/St. Martin’s (publisher)
  - Len Bruzzese: same as above
  - Steve Weinberg: same
  - Edward Iwata: perhaps affiliated with IRE since his work is mentioned there.
  - James K. Gentry, Chris Roush, Howard Schilit similarly.
- conference: "Not Listed"
- year: "Not Listed"
- title: Determined as "Resources for Investigative Business Reporters" or similar
- description: A concise summary about the resources provided.
- keywords: Relevant terms from the content.

I think that's all. Now, I'll format this into a JSON structure accordingly, ensuring correct syntax and data types.
