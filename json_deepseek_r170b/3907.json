Alright, I need to create a JSON object from the given tipsheet for an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, the ID is provided as 3907, so that's straightforward. Next, I need to handle the authors section. Looking at the tipsheet, Greg LeRoy is listed as the Executive Director of Good Jobs First, along with his contact information. Since there are no other authors mentioned, the authors list will have only one entry with his details.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, and the year is June 2013, so those fields are easy to fill in. The title of the tipsheet is about reporting on economic development subsidies and recipient companies, which I can condense into a concise string.

For the description, it needs to be a brief summary. I'll mention that it's a guide with resources for investigating economic development subsidies, including programs, company deals, tax incentives, and transparency. That should cover the main points without being too lengthy.

Now, onto the keywords. The user wants up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking through the content, relevant keywords could be "economic development," "subsidies," "transparency," "tax incentives," and "investigative reporting." These capture the essence of the tipsheet's focus areas.

I should ensure that all values are in English since the original text is in English and properly enclose keys and string values in quotes. Also, I need to make sure there are no markdown formats in the final JSON output as per the user's instruction.
