Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user has given me a block of text that seems to contain information about various editors from different news organizations along with their contact details and some additional content. They want me to create a JSON object based on specific instructions.

First, I need to parse the input carefully. Looking at the input, there are multiple sections each starting with a name, followed by their role (like Editor), then links to helpdesks, websites, social media handles, and sometimes some additional text about events or topics they're covering.

The user's requirements include extracting id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is fixed at 5993. For authors, I need a list where each entry has name, email, and affiliation. They emphasize not to make up names; if there’s no name listed, leave it null. Email and affiliation can be null but should use the news organization as affiliation if available.

I notice that in each section, the editor's name is provided (like Andrea Arzaba, Spanish Editor), followed by their email (helpdesk.gijn.org/support/home) and their social media links. So I'll extract each editor's name, set email to null since it's a general helpdesk, and use their role as affiliation if no specific organization is mentioned.

Next, the conference key needs to be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Scanning through the text, there’s no mention of any conferences, so I'll default this to "Not Listed".

The year isn't provided anywhere in the input, so that will also be "Not Listed". 

For the title and description, it seems each editor is introducing their section with a greeting or a brief statement about their coverage. Since there are multiple editors, maybe I can make the title a general one like "Investigative Reporting Around the World" as seen at the end of the input, and the description could be a summary that these sections provide insights into investigative reporting from different regions.

Keywords should be up to five terms, excluding conference names. Looking at the content, keywords like "investigative journalism", "global media", "reporting trends", "editorial insights" seem appropriate.

I'll structure each author entry with their name, email as null, and affiliation based on their role or organization if mentioned. Then compile all these into a JSON object following the specified keys.

I need to make sure that all values are in English unless the original text is otherwise, but everything here seems to be in English except for some Chinese characters which might not impact the JSON structure as per the instructions.

Finally, I'll format everything correctly with quotes and proper syntax. Double-checking each part to ensure no made-up data is included and that all fields adhere to the user's guidelines.
