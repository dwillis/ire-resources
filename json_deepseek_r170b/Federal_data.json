Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about federal data for local stories from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The user provided detailed information about various federal databases and how they can be used by reporters.

First, I'll identify each part of the required JSON structure:

1. **id**: It should be "Federal_data" as specified.
2. **authors**: There's one author listed, Gavin Off from the Charlotte Observer. His email is provided, so I'll include that along with his affiliation.
3. **conference**: The mention of NICAR (which stands for National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting) indicates this tipsheet is likely from an IRE conference since IRE includes NICAR events.
4. **year**: The input doesn't specify the year, so it will be "Not Listed".
5. **title**: The main title given is "Federal Data For Local Stories".
6. **description**: I need a concise summary of the tipsheet in 1-2 sentences. It should highlight how federal data can be used to enhance local reporting.
7. **keywords**: Up to five relevant terms excluding conference and authors. The databases mentioned like USDA subsidies, OSHA, FEC, etc., are good keywords.

I'll structure all this information into a JSON object, ensuring proper formatting with quotation marks and commas where necessary. Each value will be in English as per the instructions.
