Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me carefully read through the provided document to extract the necessary information.

First, the title of the session is "Pushing Back: Strategic resistance to harassment and threat" presented by Bruce Shapiro. His affiliation is the Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma at Columbia Journalism School. The conference is IRE 2017, held on June 22, 2017.

Looking at the content, the tipsheet discusses how reporters are becoming targets of various threats, including digital attacks, social media harassment, and direct instigation of violence. It also outlines strategies to push back against these threats, such as taking them seriously, sharing with editors, securing digital presence, and maintaining ethical standards. Additionally, it covers the cost of these threats and provides resources from the Dart Center.

For the JSON object, I'll need to structure it with the specified keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. 

- The id is given as 5145.
- Authors should be a list. Since only Bruce Shapiro is mentioned, his name will be included. Email and affiliation are null since they aren't provided in the text.
- Conference is IRE because it's clearly stated as IRE 2017.
- Year is 2017 as per the date given.
- Title is "Pushing Back: Strategic resistance to harassment and threat".
- Description needs to be a concise summary. I'll mention that it addresses threats against journalists, strategies for resistance, and related costs.
- Keywords should include relevant terms like harassment, digital attacks, journalist safety, media ethics, and online threats.

I must ensure all values are in English, properly quoted, and within the specified limits. No made-up information is added, especially for email and affiliation if not provided.
