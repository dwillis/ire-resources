Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down the steps.

First, understanding the structure: The JSON should have keys like id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is given as 5204. 

Looking at the authors section, Katie LaGrone is the main author with her email and affiliations listed (WPTV, WFTS, FOX 4). Since there's only one author mentioned, I'll list her details accordingly.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE since it's from an IRE event. The year isn't specified in the text, so I'll set that to "Not Listed".

For the title, it's about tips on domestic violence reporting, so I'll use something concise like "Tips on helping you cut through the he said/she said of domestic violence".

The description needs to be a brief summary. I'll note that it provides strategies for accessing court records and interviewing victims.

Keywords should include relevant terms: court records, domestic violence, investigative journalism, interviewing techniques, and DV cases.

I need to ensure all values are in English, properly quoted, and no markdown is used. Also, make sure the JSON structure is correct without any errors.
