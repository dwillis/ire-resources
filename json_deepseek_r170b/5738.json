Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided detailed notes about balancing family life with investigative journalism.

First, I'll set the id as 5738 since that's specified. Next, the authors section: Megan Luther is listed, but her email and affiliation aren't provided, so I'll leave those null.

The conference is clearly IRE, and although the year isn't mentioned, it says to use "Not Listed" in such cases. The title should be concise, like "Balancing Family Life with Investigative Journalism."

For the description, I need a 1-2 sentence summary. It should highlight managing guilt, finding an ideal workplace, and present parenting tips.

Keywords are important too. They can't include conference or authors, so I'll pick relevant terms: investigative journalism, work-life balance, parenting, flexible hours, supportive workplace.

I have to ensure all keys and values are in English and enclosed in quotes. Double-checking everything meets the requirements before finalizing.
