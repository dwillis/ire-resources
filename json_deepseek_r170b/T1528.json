Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query and the provided input. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, the JSON should have specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as T1528. 

Looking at the input, I see that the main story is from the Star-Ledger, authored by Kathy Barrett Carter and Joe Donohue. Their affiliations are clearly stated as "Star-Ledger", so that goes into their respective objects.

The conference is mentioned as "IRE" in the text, so that's straightforward for the conference key. The year is 2000, as seen in the date provided within the content.

For the title, I'll use the cover story's main focus, which seems to be about racial profiling by the New Jersey State Police. So, "Racial Profiling by New Jersey State Police" makes sense.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The investigation uncovered that minorities were being targeted, leading to various consequences like indictments and policy changes. I'll make sure it's a couple of sentences in simple terms.

Keywords should include racial profiling, police misconduct, New Jersey State Police, consent decree, and indictment. These capture the essence without being too lengthy.

I need to ensure all values are correctly formatted, with proper quotation marks and structure. No made-up names; since Kathy and Joe are listed, their details are included, but if there were no authors mentioned, I'd leave name as null.

Double-checking everything: id is correct, authors have all necessary fields with appropriate affiliations, conference is IRE, year is 2000, title accurately reflects the story, description is clear and concise, keywords are relevant and within five terms. 

I think that's it. Time to put it all together into a properly formatted JSON.
