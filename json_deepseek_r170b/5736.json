Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain. Let me go through this step by step.

First, looking at the input, it's titled "Web development for beginners" presented by Neil Bedi. His contact info is @_neilbedi and neilbedi@gmail.com. There's no explicit mention of his affiliation, but since he's presenting at an IRE conference, I can assume his affiliation is with IRE unless stated otherwise.

The description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. The tipsheet covers HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics, along with exercises for creating a personal homepage. So, the summary should reflect that it's an introductory session on web development fundamentals.

Next, keywords are important. They shouldn't include the conference or authors. From the content, relevant keywords would be "HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript", "web development", and maybe "beginners" since it's aimed at them.

The conference is IRE, as that's where the tipsheet is from. The year isn't provided in the text, so it should be "Not Listed".

For the authors array, each entry needs name, email, and affiliation. Neil Bedi is listed with his email but no explicit affiliation beyond presenting at IRE, so affiliation can be null unless we assume IRE as his organization, which might not be accurate.

Putting this all together, I structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring that all keys are correctly formatted and values are enclosed in quotes.

```json

  "id": 5736,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": "neilbedi@gmail.com",
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Web development for beginners",
  "description": "A beginner's guide to web development, covering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with hands-on exercises.",
  "keywords": ["HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript", "web development"]
}
```
