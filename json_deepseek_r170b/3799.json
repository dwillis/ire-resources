Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given input about shadow banking from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The user has provided specific instructions on how to structure this JSON, with keys like id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, I notice that the ID is 3799 as per the user's instruction. Next, looking at the input, there are mentions of Yale University professors Gary Gorton and Andrew Metrick in the context of "From 'Securitization' by Yale University professors..." So these two should be the authors. Since their emails or affiliations aren't provided, I'll set name to "Gary Gorton" and "Andrew Metrick", with email and affiliation as null.

The conference is mentioned as IRE in the initial input line, so that's straightforward. The year isn't specified anywhere in the text, so it should be "Not Listed". 

For the title, the main subject is "Shadow Banking", so that's clear. The description needs to be a concise summary. Looking at the content, shadow banking involves non-traditional financial institutions creating and trading securities from loans. So I can summarize that in one or two sentences.

Keywords are next. They should be no more than five terms excluding conference and authors. From the input, relevant keywords would include "shadow banking", "securitization", "asset-backed securities", "collateralized debt obligations", and "financial regulation".

Putting it all together, I need to structure this into a JSON object with each key properly enclosed in quotes and values as specified. Ensuring that authors are an array of objects, each with name, email, and affiliation, even if some are null.

I should double-check that there's no made-up information; since the professors' names are provided, I can include them without issues. Also, make sure the JSON syntax is correct, with commas in the right places and proper use of quotation marks.
