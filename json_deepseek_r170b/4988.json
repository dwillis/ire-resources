Alright, let me try to figure this out. So the user has given me a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference about using social media and the internet in reporting by Lynda Cohen from BreakingAC.com. They want me to create a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, I need to extract the necessary information. The id is given as 4988. Under authors, there's only one author mentioned, Lynda Cohen. Her email and affiliation aren't provided in the text, so those will be null. Affiliation can sometimes be inferred from the context, but here it's BreakingAC.com, which is a news organization, so I should include that.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE. The year isn't mentioned anywhere in the text, so I'll put "Not Listed" for that field. 

For the title, the main heading is "USING SOCIAL MEDIA AND INTERNET IN REPORTING". That's straightforward.

The description needs to be a concise summary of the tipsheet. It should mention how social media helps in reporting by finding sources and story ideas, interacting with readers, and building trust. I'll make sure it's 1-2 sentences and simple.

Keywords are next. They can't include the conference or authors, so I need relevant terms like "social media", "reporting tools", "source building", "online interaction", and "journalism tips". I have to limit it to five terms.

Now, putting all this together into a JSON structure with the correct keys and ensuring all values are in English. Also, making sure that any missing information is appropriately marked as null.

I think that's everything. Let me double-check each field to ensure I haven't missed anything.
