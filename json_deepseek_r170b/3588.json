Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions about the structure and content of this JSON.

First, let me read through the tipsheet carefully to extract all necessary information. The title is "Spycraft: Keeping your sources private" presented by Steve Doig from Arizona State University's Cronkite School of Journalism. 

The id needs to be 3588 as specified. Under authors, I have only one author, Steve Doig. His email and affiliation aren't provided in the text, so those will be null. The conference is clearly an IRE event since it mentions "Investigative Reporters and Editors conferences" at the top.

Next, the year isn't explicitly mentioned in the provided text, so I'll set that to "Not Listed". For the description, I need a concise summary of what the tipsheet coversâ€”essentially methods for protecting sources through privacy measures like encrypted communications and secure internet practices.

Now, keywords. The main topics are encryption, privacy, surveillance, security, and anonymity. These are all relevant and fit within five terms.

I should structure this into the required JSON format with each key properly enclosed in quotes and values following the specified guidelines.
