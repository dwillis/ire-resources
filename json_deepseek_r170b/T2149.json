Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE). The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, let's look at the input. It includes an article titled "A Lesson in Excess" by Chris Davis and Matthew Doig of the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, with contact info for Chris. There's a summary explaining how Florida's School Recognition Program had no accountability, leading to misuse of funds. The tipsheet also provides advice on how to investigate similar programs.

The required JSON keys are: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. 

Starting with the ID: It should be T2149 as per the user's instruction.

Authors: I need a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. Chris Davis is listed with his email, so his affiliation is Sarasota Herald-Tribune. Matthew Doig doesn't have an email provided, so his entry will have name and affiliation without email. 

Conference: Since the tipsheet is from IRE, that's straightforward.

Year: The input doesn't specify the conference year, so it should be "Not Listed".

Title: The title of the article is clear, "A Lesson in Excess".

Description: Needs to be a concise summary. The key points are Florida's program lacking oversight and misuse of funds, so I'll phrase that into 1-2 sentences.

Keywords: Up to five terms. From the content, relevant keywords could be "school funding", "accountability", "education spending", "government waste", "investigative journalism".

Putting it all together, ensuring proper formatting with quotes and correct data types. No markdown, just plain JSON.

I need to make sure authors are correctly structured as an array of objects, each with name, email, affiliation, handling cases where some fields are null. Also, verifying that the description accurately reflects the article's main point without being too lengthy.
