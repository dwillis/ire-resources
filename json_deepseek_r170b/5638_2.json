Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conferences. The user has given specific instructions on how each key should be populated.

First, the id is straightforward: it's given as "5638_2". So that goes into the JSON without any changes.

Next, looking at authors. The input mentions Meg Moritz from The Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma. Her name is explicitly provided, so I'll set her name to "Meg Moritz". There's no email or affiliation mentioned beyond the news organization, which is The Dart Center. So, her email will be null, and affiliation will be "The Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma".

For conference, since it's from an IRE conference, that should be clear. The year isn't directly provided in the text snippet, so according to instructions, it'll be "Not Listed".

The title is given as "Considerations for Coverage of Mass Shootings". That's perfect.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The main points are about responsible reporting practices to avoid glorifying shooters and preventing copycat effects. So I can write: "A guide to ethical journalism practices when covering mass shootings, emphasizing the importance of not glorifying perpetrators and reducing the risk of copycat violence."

Keywords should be relevant and no more than five. From the content, appropriate keywords would be "mass shootings", "copycat effect", "journalism ethics", "school shootings", and "responsible reporting".

Putting it all together, I structure each key with the correct values, ensuring that all are in English and properly quoted.
