Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Bill Dedman's presentation at an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, the id is given as 4541, that's straightforward. Next, the authors section requires some attention. The main author mentioned is Bill Dedman, who is affiliated with Newsday, and his email is provided. I don't see any other authors listed, so the list will only include him.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE since it's an IRE conference tipsheet. The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the text, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed". 

For the title, it's "Writing memorable investigative stories (even with data)", which is repeated throughout the document. The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet offers advice on crafting compelling stories using data and includes various strategies like covering the field and rebutting counterarguments.

Keywords should include relevant terms without repeating the conference or author names. I'll go with "investigative journalism", "data storytelling", "reporting tips", "storytelling techniques", and "journalism best practices".

I need to ensure all keys are in English and properly quoted. Let me structure this accordingly, making sure each part aligns with the instructions provided.
