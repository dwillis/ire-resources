Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. The input provided includes various investigative reporting tipsheets from Andy Lehren of The New York Times at the NICAR conference in St. Louis, 2012. 

First, I'll identify the main sections and extract relevant information. The title seems to be "Mining Data Around The Globe" by Andy Lehren. Since the authors section only mentions Andy Lehren without an email or affiliation beyond The New York Times, I'll structure that part accordingly.

Next, the conference is clearly NICAR in St. Louis during 2012, so those fields are straightforward. For the description, I need a concise summary of what the tipsheet coversâ€”using global data sources to investigate issues like lead battery recycling and chemical imports.

Keywords should capture the essence without being too lengthy. Terms like "data journalism," "investigative reporting," "global investigations," "environmental oversight," and "trade regulations" seem fitting.

I'll make sure each part of the JSON is properly formatted, with all keys in quotes and values appropriately enclosed as well. Since Andy's email isn't provided, it will remain null. The affiliation is clearly The New York Times.
