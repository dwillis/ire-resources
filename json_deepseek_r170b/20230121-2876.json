Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about using Solutions Journalism in Investigations from an IRE conference tipsheet.

First, the id should be 2876 as specified. The authors section is tricky because the original text mentions Brie Zeltner but doesn't list others explicitly. So, I'll include her with her affiliation as Cleveland Plain Dealer and leave email null since it's not provided.

Next, the conference is clearly IRE, so that's straightforward. The year isn't mentioned in the input, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

For the title, the main heading is about using Solutions Journalism in Investigations, which fits perfectly. 

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet emphasizes adding a solutions component to investigations to show that problems can be addressed and to provide hope. So, I'll craft a 1-2 sentence summary capturing that essence.

Keywords are limited to five terms. Looking through the content, key terms include "solutions journalism", "investigative reporting", "problem-solving", "journalism techniques", and "hope in journalism".

Putting it all together, I ensure each field is correctly formatted and enclosed in quotes as per JSON standards.
