Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on this query about a tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conferences. The user provided some detailed information, and they want the response strictly as a JSON object with specific keys.

First, let me break down what's needed. The JSON should have id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. Each author in the authors list needs name, email, affiliation. Also, no making up namesâ€”leave them null if not provided. Emails and affiliations can be null too, but if a news org is mentioned, that becomes the affiliation.

Looking at the input, I see three presenters: Julia Angwin from ProPublica, Jon Keegan, and Jeremy B. Merrill from The New York Times. So their names are there, along with their affiliations. No emails provided, so those will be null.

The conference is NICAR, which stands for National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting, part of IRE. The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the text, but since it's a tipsheet from NICAR 2017, as seen at the end where slides are linked with bit.ly/facebook-nicar17, I can infer the year is 2017.

The title seems to be "Breaking Through The Facebook Wall" based on the first line. 

For the description, I need a concise summary in simple language. From the content, they discussed how Facebook uses data for ads, the browser extension used to collect ad data, and the implications of political polarization and microtargeting on journalism.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. So, I'll pick "Facebook", "data privacy", "ad targeting", "political polarization", and "microtargeting".

Putting it all together, making sure everything is correctly formatted as a JSON object with proper quotation marks and structure.
