Okay, so I need to create a JSON object from the given input. The input seems to be about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference workshop related to D3.js. Let me break down what each part requires.

First, the id should be "4128_1". That's straightforward.

Next, authors: I need to list them with name, email, and affiliation. The problem is that in the input provided, there are no explicit author names listed except for Alastair Dant mentioned under commits. So, I'll set name as null because it's not provided. Email and affiliation can also be null since there's no information given.

The conference is NICAR 2014, so the conference key will be "NICAR". The year is clearly stated as 2014, so that goes into the year field.

For the title, the repository name is "demystifying-d3", which seems appropriate. 

Description needs to be a concise summary of the workshop's content. From the input, it's about using D3.js for data visualization and includes code examples and instructions on how to navigate through different stages of the workshop using Git.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. So, "D3.js", "data visualization", "workshop", "GitHub", and "NICAR" are relevant here, but I need to exclude "NICAR" as per instructions, so maybe just focus on D3.js, data binding, interactivity, Git, and workshop.

Putting it all together, the JSON structure takes shape with each key filled appropriately based on the information extracted from the input.

```json
{
  "id": "4128_1",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": 2014,
  "title": "demystifying-d3",
  "description": "A workshop at NICAR 2014 focusing on using D3.js for data visualization, with code examples and Git instructions.",
  "keywords": [
    "D3.js",
    "data binding",
    "interactivity",
    "Git",
    "workshop"
  ]
}
```
