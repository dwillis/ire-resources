Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on this tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on the structure with keys like id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, looking at the content provided, it's about collaboration between inewsource and KPBS. They talk about their partnership, tools they use for producing radio and TV content, workflow tips, delivering final products, and an example of putting data on TV with a case study called "The Case of the Mello-Roos Map."

Now, the user wants the JSON to have specific keys. The id is given as 3973_1, so that's straightforward.

Next, authors: inewsource and KPBS are mentioned as organizations. However, individual authors aren't listed by name, only their roles like Joanne Faryon as a reporter. Since the user said not to make up names and leave null if none is listed, I think authors should be an array where each entry has name, email, and affiliation. But since specific names aren't provided except for inewsource and KPBS being organizations, maybe each organization can be an author with their affiliation as themselves.

Conference is clearly IRE because the tipsheet mentions it's from an Investigative Reporters and Editors conference.

The year isn't specified anywhere in the text, so according to instructions, it should be "Not Listed".

Title: The main title seems to be "Collaboration: Tips & Techniques" or "What I wish someone had told me a year ago". Since both are present, perhaps combining them would capture the essence.

Description needs to be 1-2 sentences. It's about the partnership between inewsource and KPBS, their collaboration techniques, tools used, workflow, and delivering content across media platforms.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking at the content: collaboration, data journalism, investigative reporting, multimedia storytelling, and partnerships seem relevant.

Putting it all together, I need to structure each part correctly, ensuring that nulls are handled appropriately, especially for emails since they aren't provided.

    }
  ],
