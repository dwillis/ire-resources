Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to approach this user's query. They provided some detailed notes from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet by Nicole Vap. The task is to convert these notes into a specific JSON object with several keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, I'll start by parsing the input data. The author's name is clearly listed as Nicole Vap. Her email and affiliation are also provided, which makes it easy to fill in those fields. Since there's only one author mentioned, the authors array will have a single object with her details.

Next, determining the conference. The notes mention IRE-TV and TEGNA, so the conference is definitely "IRE". Thatâ€™s straightforward.

The title of the tipsheet isn't explicitly stated, but looking at the content, it's about using data in investigative reporting. So, "Using Data and Documents for Investigative Reporting" seems like a fitting title that encapsulates the main theme.

For the description, I need a concise summary. The notes emphasize using data to make stories irrefutable, fact-checking oneself, following money trails, and not relying solely on PIOs. So, a 1-2 sentence summary would mention leveraging data and documents for accountability and storytelling in journalism.

Keywords are next. I should pick terms that represent the key points without including the conference or author names. Looking through the content, "data journalism", "investigative reporting", "fact-checking", "public records", and "accountability" seem appropriate. They each capture a central theme of the tipsheet.

The year isn't provided in the notes, so I'll default to "Not Listed". The ID is given as 5528, which I just need to include as per the instructions.

I also need to ensure all keys are enclosed in quotes and that there's no extra text outside the JSON object. Since the user emphasized this, I'll make sure the response is purely the JSON without any additional explanations or formatting.

Finally, I'll double-check each field to confirm accuracy: author details are correct, conference is properly identified, title and description are concise yet descriptive, keywords are relevant and limited to five terms. Everything seems in order.
