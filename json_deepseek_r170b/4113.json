Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down what each part requires.

First, the id is straightforward; it's given as 4113. Next, I look at authors. The input mentions Denise Malan with her email and affiliation. Her name isn't null because she's listed, so I'll include that along with her contact info and the fact that she's from IRE. 

The conference is clearly IRE, so that's set. The year isn't provided in the text, so it should be "Not Listed". For the title, looking at the content, it seems to focus on hazardous materials incidents, so something like "Hazardous Materials Incident Reporting" makes sense.

The description needs to be a concise summary. I'll mention the key points: what's reported, what's included in reports, and any limitations of the system. 

Keywords are next. The main topics here are the incident reporting subsystem, hazardous materials, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), environmental enforcement, and toxic release inventory.

Putting it all together, I ensure each field is correctly formatted as per the instructions. No extra information or made-up dataâ€”everything comes directly from the provided text.
