Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an IRE conference. Let me go through this step by step.

First, looking at the input, the title is about localizing investigations into sexual misconduct. The conference is clearly stated as IRE - Orlando in June 2018, so the year should be 2018.

Next, the panelists are Bente Birkeland from KUNC Public Radio, Jim Brunner from The Seattle Times, and Joel Ebert from The Tennessean/USA Today. Their contact info is provided, but I need to structure each author with name, email, and affiliation. Even though their emails are listed, since the user specified that if the text includes the news organization, use that as the affiliation, so I can fill in the affiliations accordingly.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers how to get sources to talk, using documents, investigating old claims, and handling challenges. So I'll craft a short sentence that captures all these aspects without getting too detailed.

Keywords should be up to five terms. From the content, the main keywords would be "sexual misconduct," "investigative reporting," "source interviewing," "document analysis," and "journalism ethics." These cover the essential topics discussed.

I also need to make sure each value is in English and properly quoted. The ID is given as 5711_2, so that's straightforward. Since it's an IRE conference, that key is set correctly.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part carefully, ensuring no made-up names are included and all affiliations are accurate based on the provided information.
