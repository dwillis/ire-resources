Alright, I need to create a JSON object from the given input following specific instructions. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, identify the required keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The id is straightforward: "Sableman_DataPrivacyScorecard_2012_v3_print".

Next, authors. From the text, Mark Sableman is listed with his email and affiliation. So, one author object with name, email, and affiliation. No others mentioned, so only one in the list.

Conference needs to be IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed. The input doesn't specify which conference it's from, so "Not Listed".

Year: Since the year is 2012 as per the title, that goes into the year field.

Title is clear: "Data Privacy Scorecard: What To Watch in 2012".

Description should be a concise summary of one to two sentences. The text discusses data privacy regulations and proposals from different sources, so the description needs to capture that essence simply.

Keywords are up to five terms, excluding conference and authors. Looking through the content, relevant keywords include "data privacy", "regulations", "Online Behavioral Advertising (OBA)", "self-regulation", and "Do Not Track".

Now, putting it all together in JSON format, ensuring proper syntax with quotes around keys and values.
