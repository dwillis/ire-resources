Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let's go through each part step by step.

First, the id is specified as 3600, so that's straightforward.

Next, authors. The tipsheet mentions David Cay Johnston as the author. I don't see any other authors listed, so the authors array will have one element with name set to "David Cay Johnston". Thereâ€™s no email or affiliation provided in the text, so those fields will be null.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE" since it's from an IRE event. The year is given as 2011, so that goes into the year field.

For the title, the tipsheet is titled "COVERING THE ECONOMY AND BUSINESS", but in the initial part of the text, the workshop is called "Better Watchdog Workshop". However, the main section heading is about covering economy and business, so I'll use that as the title.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet provides various resources for reporters covering economic data, tax policies, SEC filings, etc. So the description will mention these key areas it helps with.

Keywords should include terms like "economic data", "tax policy", "business reporting", "SEC filings", and "subsidies" as they are central to the content.

I need to ensure all keys are in quotes and values are correctly formatted. No markdown, just a plain JSON structure.

  "description": "A tipsheet providing resources and data sources for journalists covering economic and business topics.",
