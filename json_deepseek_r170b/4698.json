Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on this tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let's break down what each part requires.

First, the id is given as 4698, that's straightforward. Next, authors. The original text doesn't mention any specific authors, so the list will have elements with name as null. Email and affiliation are also null since there's no info provided. 

Conference is definitely IRE because it's from an IRE tipsheet. The year isn't specified in the text, so I'll put "Not Listed". For the title, the main focus seems to be on saving time searching federal records with Sqoop, so I'll go with that.

The description needs a concise summary. Sqoop is a free service helping journalists search and set alerts for public records from SEC, patents, courts, etc., which helps them stay ahead with timely stories. That's two sentences in simple language.

Keywords should be up to five terms. The main ones are Sqoop, public records, federal data, journalism tools, investigative reporting. These capture the essence without including the conference or authors.

Putting it all together, each key is properly filled out with the required values, making sure everything is in English and enclosed in quotes.
