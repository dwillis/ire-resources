Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given data from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conferences. The user has provided several resources related to gun investigations, including datasets and articles from Mother Jones, Stanford, Tampa Bay Times, Mayors Against Illegal Guns, Everytown/Moms Demand Action, MSNBC, and The Atlantic Cities.

First, I should identify the required keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. 

The ID is given as 4225, so that's straightforward. Next, the authors are a list where each has name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the data provided, I don't see any specific author names listed; it's all from news organizations. So I think the authors' names should be null since they aren't specified individually.

The conference is either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Since this tipsheet is from an IRE conference, that's clear. 

For the year, the data ranges from 1982 to 2013, but without a specific event year mentioned in the context of the conference itself, so it should be "Not Listed".

The title needs to encapsulate what the tipsheet covers. Given that it's about resources and datasets on gun violence investigations, I think "Resources for Investigating Gun Violence" would be appropriate.

The description must be a concise summary. The tipsheet provides data and investigative reports from multiple sources, so something like: "A collection of data and investigative reports from various news organizations detailing mass shootings, gun violence trends, and related policies."

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference or authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords could include "gun violence", "mass shootings", "investigative reporting", "data journalism", and "firearms policy".

Now, putting it all together in JSON format with proper syntax, ensuring that strings are enclosed in double quotes and null values where needed.
