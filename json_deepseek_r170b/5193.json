Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. They provided specific instructions about what each key should contain.

First, the id is given as 5193, so that's straightforward. The authors are Gerry Lanosga and Jason Martin with their emails and affiliations. I'll list them in an array with their details.

The conference isn't explicitly mentioned, but since the user mentioned it could be "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Looking at the content, it seems related to IRE because of the context about investigative reporters. So I'll set the conference to "IRE".

The year in the text is 2016 from the citation, so that's clear. The title is provided as "Journalists, Sources, and Policy Outcomes: Insights from IRE Contest Entries", which I can use directly.

For the description, it needs a concise summary. The study analyzed contest entries over decades to understand how journalists and sources influence policy outcomes. That should fit in 1-2 sentences.

Keywords are next. The main points are investigative journalism, journalist-source relations, policy outcomes, contest entries, and IRE. But since the user said not to include the conference name as a keyword, I'll use the other terms.

Putting it all together, I structure each key according to the instructions, making sure emails and affiliations are correctly placed. All values are in English with proper quotes and formatting.
