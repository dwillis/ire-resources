Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's input which includes tips from an IRE session. Let me break down what's required.

First, the structure needs specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 4190. 

Looking at the input, there are five tips mentioned, each with a heading and some details. The author is Jaxon Van Derbeken from the San Francisco Chronicle. His email is provided, so I'll include that.

The conference is clearly stated as an IRE session on June 28, 2014, so the year is 2014. The title seems to be "Five Law Enforcement Tips."

For the description, it should be a concise summary of the tips in simple language. The keywords are up to five terms related to law enforcement and journalism.

I need to ensure all values are correctly formatted and enclosed in quotes. No markdown, just plain JSON.

```json
{
  "id": 4190,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Jaxon Van Derbeken",
      "email": "jvanderbeken@sfchronicle.com",
      "affiliation": "San Francisco Chronicle"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2014,
  "title": "Five Law Enforcement Tips",
  "description": "A tipsheet from an IRE session providing advice on cultivating sources, understanding the law, attending court proceedings, and identifying information flows to enhance investigative reporting.",
  "keywords": ["law enforcement", "investigative reporting", "source cultivation", "court proceedings", "information flow"]
}
```
