Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, the id is straightforward: "4829_1". Next, authors. The tipsheet doesn't mention any names, so I'll set authors to an empty list since there's no author information provided.

Conference is clearly "IRE" as it's from their event. Year isn't specified in the data, so I'll default that to "Not Listed".

For the title, looking at the content, it's about handling breaking news with data practices. So a fitting title would be "Breaking News Data Practices Tipsheet".

The description needs to summarize the tipsheet concisely. It focuses on strategies for journalists covering breaking news using data, so I'll write: "A tipsheet providing strategies for journalists to effectively handle breaking news through data analysis and contextual reporting."

Keywords should capture the essence without including the conference or authors. Terms like "breaking news", "data journalism", "investigative reporting", "contextual reporting", and "journalism strategies" fit well.

I'll structure all these elements into a JSON object, ensuring each key is properly quoted and values are in English as required.

```json
{
  "id": "4829_1",
  "authors": [],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Breaking News Data Practices Tipsheet",
  "description": "A tipsheet providing strategies for journalists to effectively handle breaking news through data analysis and contextual reporting.",
  "keywords": ["breaking news", "data journalism", "investigative reporting", "contextual reporting", "journalism strategies"]
}
```
