Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the structure needs to have specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 4616. 

Looking at the content, there's no author mentioned by name, so I'll set "authors" to an empty list since we can't make up names.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, and the year isn't specified in the text, so I'll put "Not Listed".

For the title, it seems to be about building sources, defeating spin, and winning, which is the main heading. So I'll go with "Build Sources. Defeat Spin. #WINNING."

The description should summarize the content in 1-2 sentences. The tipsheet talks about engaging with sources effectively, so I'll write that it's a guide on building sources by being responsive, showing interest, and understanding decision-making processes.

Keywords need to be up to five terms. From the text, relevant keywords are "sources," "journalism," "reporting," "decision-making," and "transparency."

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring all keys and values are in quotes and correctly formatted.

```json
{
  "id": 4616,
  "authors": [],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Build Sources. Defeat Spin. #WINNING.",
  "description": "A tipsheet providing advice on building sources, defeating spin, and effective journalism practices.",
  "keywords": ["sources", "journalism", "reporting", "decision-making", "transparency"]
}
```
