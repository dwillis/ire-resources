Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, I need to create a JSON object from the provided input based on specific instructions.

First, looking at the user's query, they want a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The response should only be a JSON object with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. 

The id is given as 5562. That part seems straightforward.

Next, the authors section needs to be a list of objects, each containing name, email, and affiliation. I see two presenters mentioned: Todd Wallack from the Boston Globe and Andrew Ba Tran from The Washington Post. Both have their emails provided, so I can include those. Their affiliations are clear from the context, so I should list those as well.

The conference is specified as "IRE", which matches since it's an IRE event in Boston. The year is clearly stated as 2018.

For the title, the header mentions "Datasets you should be using" and "IRE Boston Watchdog Workshop". Combining these, a suitable title would be "Datasets You Should Be Using".

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet lists various datasets for investigative reporting, so I can phrase it as a guide that highlights essential data sources useful in such journalism.

Keywords should include the main topics without mentioning the conference or authors. From the datasets listed, terms like "public records", "investigative journalism", and "data-driven reporting" fit well. Including "government transparency" and "watchdog journalism" adds more context. I'll limit it to five keywords as instructed.

I need to ensure that all values are in English since the original text is in English, and enclose keys and string values in quotes. Also, avoid making up any names or details not provided.

Putting it all together, the JSON structure will have each key filled appropriately with the extracted information.
