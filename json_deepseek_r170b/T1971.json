Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided query. Let me go through it step by step.

First, looking at the user's instructions: they want a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The input includes Mark Skertic's contact info, SEC resources, various forms like 10-K, 8-K, etc., other documents, and mentions Adam Levy of Bloomberg News from IREâ€™s 2002 conference.

The JSON structure should have specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as T1971.

For the authors section, it's a list. Mark Skertic is listed with his email and affiliation (Chicago Tribune). Adam Levy is mentioned as preparing the handout but without contact info, so I'll include him with nulls for email and affiliation since Bloomberg News isn't explicitly stated next to his name.

Conference is clearly "IRE". The year is 2002. 

The title should reflect SEC resources and corporate documents, so something like "Using Corporate Documents and SEC Filings for Investigative Reporting".

Description needs to be a concise summary. I'll mention navigating SEC filings and other financial records for investigative journalism.

Keywords are up to five terms: "SEC", "corporate documents", "financial reporting", "investigative journalism", "public records".

Putting it all together, making sure all values are in English and properly quoted.
