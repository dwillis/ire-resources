Alright, so I'm trying to create this JSON object based on the input provided. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I need to parse the entire input to extract relevant information. The user wants a JSON with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is given as T481, so that's straightforward.

Looking for authors in the text, I see mentions like "Tommy Kaas" from Randers Police District and "Morten Brønniche" from Dagens Medicin. These seem to be the authors contributing to the stories mentioned. However, some parts of the input don't explicitly mention authors, so for those, I'll have to leave their names as null.

Next, I need to determine the conference. The input mentions "NICAR" at the end, which stands for the National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting. So, the conference key should be "NICAR".

For the year, since the input includes dates like 2002 and 2003 in some of the stories, but it's not explicitly stated when the conference took place. Therefore, I'll set the year to "Not Listed" as per instructions.

The title isn't directly provided, so I need to infer it from the content. The main focus seems to be on how new types of data are forming the basis for news stories, especially in Denmark across various sectors like healthcare and crime. So, a suitable title could be "New Data-Driven Stories in Danish Journalism."

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. It should mention how public records and data analysis have led to investigative journalism pieces in Denmark, covering topics such as hospital waiting times, police officer involvement in politics, and biker crime.

For keywords, I need up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords could be "data-driven journalism," "Danish journalism," "investigative reporting," "public records," and "crime analysis."

Putting it all together, each key should have its value in quotes. For authors without explicit names, I'll set their name to null. Affiliations will use the news organizations mentioned if available.

I think that covers everything. Now, let me structure this into the JSON object as specified.
