Alright, I need to create a JSON object from the provided input based on the user's instructions. Let me break down what I have to do step by step.

First, looking at the input, it starts with some headers that include "THE PAPER CHASE:" and a name, Ron Regan, who is the Chief Investigative Reporter at WEWS-TV in Cleveland. His contact information is also provided: email ron.regan@wews.com and phone number (216) 431-4220.

Then, there's a line mentioning the 2012 IRE Conference in Boston, MA, under the Broadcast category on Saturday at 2:30 pm. The title of the session seems to be "Basic Toolkit: Top 10 databases."

Following that, there are several bullet points listing different databases with their descriptions and URLs. Each database is related to various investigative topics like workplace safety, nursing home inspections, aviation safety, etc.

Now, according to the user's instructions, I need to create a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id should be 3705 as given. 

For the "authors" key, it should be a list of elements each having name, email, and affiliation. In this case, Ron Regan is listed with his email and affiliation to WEWS-TV. So I can include him in the authors array.

The "conference" key will be "IRE" because that's explicitly mentioned in the input as part of the conference name: 2012 IRE Conference.

The "year" is clearly stated as 2012, so that goes into the year field.

The "title" of the tipsheet or session is "Basic Toolkit: Top 10 databases."

For the "description," I need a concise summary in 1-2 sentences. The session covers essential databases for investigative reporting on topics like workplace safety and aviation incidents. That seems to fit well.

Next, the "keywords" should be up to five terms excluding the conference name and authors. Looking at the content, keywords could include "databases," "investigative reporting," "OSHA," "FAA," and "EPA." These are relevant and each appears in the provided databases listed.

I have to ensure that all values are in English since the original text is in English. Also, all keys must be enclosed in quotes as per JSON standards.

Now, putting it all together, I can structure the JSON object with each key appropriately filled based on the input data.

```json

  "id": 3705,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Ron Regan",
      "email": "ron.regan@wews.com",
      "affiliation": "WEWS-TV"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2012,
  "title": "Basic Toolkit: Top 10 databases",
  "description": "A tipsheet from the 2012 IRE Conference in Boston, highlighting essential databases for investigative reporting.",
  "keywords": [
    "databases",
    "investigative reporting",
    "OSHA",
    "FAA",
    "EPA"
  ]
}
```
