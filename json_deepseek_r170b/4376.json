Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Andy Boyle's presentation at NICAR16. Let me go through each key step by step.

First, the id is given as 4376, so thatâ€™s straightforward.

For authors, there's only one author mentioned: Andy Boyle. His email is andymboyle@gmail.com, and his affiliation is NBC News Breaking News. So I'll create an object with name "Andy Boyle", email "andymboyle@gmail.com", and affiliation "NBC News Breaking News".

The conference is NICAR because the hashtag #NICAR16 is present.

The year should be 2016 since it's NICAR16, which implies 2016.

The title isn't explicitly stated in the provided text. The tipsheet covers JavaScript basics, so I'll use a descriptive title like "JavaScript Basics for Journalists".

The description needs to summarize the content briefly. It seems to cover fundamental concepts of JavaScript such as variables, strings, numbers, alerts, jQuery, and control structures. So a 1-2 sentence summary would be something about introducing journalists to JavaScript basics including variables, conditionals, loops, and interactions.

For keywords, I should pick up to five relevant terms. From the content, the main topics are JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, and web development.

Putting it all together, each key must be enclosed in quotes, and the JSON structure should be correct.
