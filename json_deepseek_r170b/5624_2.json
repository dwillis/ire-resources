Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet by Melissa Segura from BuzzFeed News. 

First, I'll parse the input to extract all necessary information. The id is given as 5624_2, so that's straightforward. The authors section requires a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. Since there's only one author mentioned, Melissa Segura, her details will be included. Her email is provided, so I'll add that, and her affiliation is BuzzFeed News.

Next, the conference is clearly stated as IRE 2018, so the year is 2018. The title of the tipsheet is "Investigating Police Corruption: A Quick Start Guide." For the description, I need a concise summary in simple language. The tipsheet provides steps to identify police corruption stories, so the summary should reflect that.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Relevant keywords here could be "police corruption," "investigative journalism," "complaint procedures," "law enforcement certification," and "FOIA requests." These cover the main topics discussed.

I'll structure all these elements into a JSON object, ensuring proper formatting with quotes around keys and values. I need to avoid any markdown as per the user's request.
