Okay, so I have to create a JSON object based on the user's query about Mike Rezendes' Lucky 13 Tip-Sheet. First, let me understand what they're asking for.

They provided specific instructions with an id, authors as a list of objects, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The example response they gave helps clarify the structure.

I notice that in their example, the author's name is null because the original text didn't mention it. That means I shouldn't make up any names, so in this case, Mike Rezendes should be included with his email and affiliation if available.

The conference is listed as "IRE" which stands for Investigative Reporters and Editors. The year isn't specified, so it's set to "Not Listed". 

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet provides 13 tips on getting sources to talk, so that should be straightforward.

Keywords are up to five relevant terms. From the content, I can extract 'investigative journalism', 'source interviewing', and 'tipsheet'. I'll add 'journalism techniques' for completeness.

I have to make sure all keys are in quotes and values are properly formatted. No markdown, just a clean JSON structure.

So putting it all together, each part is addressed step by step based on the user's guidelines.
