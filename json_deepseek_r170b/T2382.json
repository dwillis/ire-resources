Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. Let me go through this step by step.

First, the user provided a grading sheet for a homework assignment related to media convergence from Spring 2005 at the University of South Florida St. Petersburg. The professor is Debbie Wolfe, an adjunct there. 

The task requires extracting specific information into predefined JSON keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id should be T2382 as given.

Looking for authors, I see "Debbie Wolfe" listed as the instructor. There's no email or other affiliations mentioned beyond her role at the university, so those can be null.

The conference isn't explicitly mentioned in the text provided. Since it's about media convergence and from a university assignment rather than an IRE or NICAR event, I'll set "conference" to "Not Listed".

For the year, it's clearly stated as Spring 2005, so that goes into the year field.

The title of the document seems to be the homework grading sheet. So, the title will reflect that.

The description needs to be a brief summary. The document is a grading rubric for evaluating multimedia journalism assignments, focusing on engagement, collaboration, storytelling, and mechanics.

Keywords should include terms relevant to the content: "media convergence", "multimedia storytelling", "journalism education", "grading criteria", and "academic assignment".

Putting it all together, each field is filled accordingly with appropriate values, ensuring that missing information remains as null where necessary.
