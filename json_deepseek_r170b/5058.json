Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions, so I'll have to follow them closely.

First, the id is fixed at 5058. Next, authors: looking at the text, I see Tyler Fisher is mentioned with his email and Twitter handle. So, name will be "Tyler Fisher", email is tylrfishr@gmail.com, affiliation is NPR since he's associated with NPR Visuals as Supervising Editor.

Conference is clearly IRE, year is 2017 as the speech was on March 3rd, 2017. The title is "Subverting the Story Model in the Age of Trump".

For description, it needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about rethinking newsroom approaches to cover Trump's administration effectively by turning spectacle into evidence and using resources like annotated tweets. So I'll phrase that into one or two sentences.

Keywords should be no more than five terms. From the content, relevant keywords are "Trump Administration", "Story Model", "Journalism Strategies", "Investigative Reporting", and "Newsroom Innovation".

I have to ensure all keys are in quotes and values are properly formatted as strings. No markdown, just plain JSON.

Putting it all together now.
