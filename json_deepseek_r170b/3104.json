Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has specified that the response should only include this JSON object, but since I'm supposed to write out my thought process first, I'll go through each step carefully.

First, looking at the structure required: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 3104. 

Next, the authors section. In the provided tipsheet, there are no specific author names mentioned, so each entry in the authors list should have name set to null. Since there's no email or affiliation provided either, those will also be null.

The conference key needs to be "IRE" because that's where this tipsheet is from. The year isn't specified anywhere in the text, so I'll set it to "Not Listed".

For the title, the original document has "Tips to Finding Aviation Stories", which seems appropriate. 

The description should be a concise summary of the content. The tipsheet provides advice on how journalists can find and investigate aviation stories by gaining trust within the industry, accessing data from various sources, understanding aviation terminology, and focusing on specific issues. So I'll summarize that into one or two sentences.

Keywords are next. They need to be no more than five terms related to the content. The main topics here are aviation, investigative journalism, data access, industry sources, and storytelling techniques. I'll list those as keywords.

Putting it all together, each field is filled out based on the information available. Since there's no author info, that part remains null. The year isn't listed, so that's handled too. Everything else falls into place with the details provided in the tipsheet.
