Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has provided specific instructions on how this should be done.

First, looking at the input, the title is "FREE AND CHEAP TOOLS FOR WRANGLING DATA" presented by T. Christian Miller and Tyler Dukes at IRE 2013 in San Antonio, Texas. The description needs to be a concise summary of the tipsheet. Since it's about various tools for data handling, I'll summarize that.

Next, the authors are listed as T. Christian Miller from ProPublica and Tyler Dukes from WRAL.com. Their emails aren't provided, so those fields will be null. The conference is clearly stated as IRE, and the year is 2013.

For keywords, I need to pick up to five relevant terms excluding the conference name and authors. The tools mentioned include Google Drive, Cometdocs, DocumentCloud, etc., but more general terms like "data analysis," "journalism tools," and "cloud-based tools" would be suitable.

I also have to make sure all keys are in English and enclosed in quotes. Each author should be an object within the authors array with name, email, and affiliation. Since emails aren't provided, they'll remain null.

Putting it all together, I structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring each key is present as per instructions.
