Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a detailed tipsheet from an IRE conference and wants me to convert it into a specific JSON format. First, I need to parse the input carefully.

Looking at the structure, there are three presenters: Scott Friedman, Keli Rabon, and Scott Zamost. Each has their name, email, and affiliation listed, so that's straightforward for the authors array.

The conference is clearly labeled as "IRE 2015 TIPSHEET," so I can extract the year as 2015 and the conference type as "IRE." The title of the session is "Broadcast: How to Get People to Talk."

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet covers techniques for different interview typesâ€”victims, insiders, and reluctant officials. So, summarizing that into one or two sentences should work.

Next, keywords. I'll pull out relevant terms like "interview techniques," "investigative journalism," "public officials," "sources," and "storytelling." These capture the essence without being too broad.

Now, constructing the JSON object with all these elements. Making sure each key is correctly formatted and that all information from the tipsheet is accurately represented. I'll double-check to ensure no data is missed or misformatted.
