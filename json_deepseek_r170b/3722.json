Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the ID is straightforwardâ€”3722 as provided. Next, looking at the authors section, I see that Cindy Chang is listed with two emails: cchang@timespicayune.com and cindy.chang@aya.yale.edu. The affiliation should be The Times-Picayune since it's mentioned right after her name.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE because the document mentions "Investigative Reporters and Editors conferences" at the top, so that's set. The year isn't provided in the text, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

For the title, the tipsheet is titled "Investigating Prisons" as indicated at the beginning of the document.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers how to investigate prisons by comparing them to schools, using statistics, and interviewing inmates. So I'll write that it provides strategies for reporting on prison conditions.

Now, the keywords. The main topics here are prisons, journalism, investigation, incarceration rates, and Louisiana. These capture the essence without being too specific or numerous.

I also need to ensure all keys are in quotes and the structure is correct. No markdown, just plain JSON with proper syntax.

Putting it all together, I should have a well-structured JSON object that accurately reflects the tipsheet's content.
