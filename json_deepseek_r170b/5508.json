Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let's go through each requirement step by step.

First, the id is specified as 5508. Got it. Next, authors should be a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. In the text, Cheryl W. Thompson is listed with two emails and affiliations: GW University and The Washington Post. So, her entry will have all details filled.

The conference is IRE since that's mentioned in the input. Year is April 2018, so year is 2018. Title isn't explicitly given, but from the content, it seems to be about tracing guns and police use of Tasers. Maybe "Investigating Police Use of Force and Gun Tracing."

Description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers sources for data on Taser-related deaths and gun tracing methods. So, something like: "Tipsheet on investigating police use of force, including data sources and methods for tracking Taser-related deaths and gun tracing."

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords could be police, Tasers, gun tracing, FOIA, and data journalism.

I think that covers all keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. Now I'll structure this into a JSON object as specified.

```json
{
  "id": 5508,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Cheryl W. Thompson",
      "email": "cheryl.thompson@washpost.com",
      "affiliation": "GW University/The Washington Post"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2018,
  "title": "Investigating Police Use of Force and Gun Tracing",
  "description": "A tipsheet providing guidance on investigating police use of force, including data sources for Taser-related deaths and methods for tracing guns.",
  "keywords": ["police", "Tasers", "gun tracing", "FOIA", "data journalism"]
}
```
