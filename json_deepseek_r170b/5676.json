Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's input. The id should be 5676 as specified.

Looking at the authors section, there are two names: Mary Hargrove and Kassie McClung. Mary has an email provided, so her entry will include that. Since there's no affiliation mentioned for either author, both will have null affiliations.

The conference isn't explicitly stated in the text. The user mentioned a 5-part series from December 2017 but didn't link it to IRE or NICAR. So, I'll set conference to "Not Listed".

For the year, it's clearly listed as 2017 when the series was published. That takes care of the year field.

The title is given as "Shadow Land: How Rape Stays Hidden in Oklahoma". The description needs to be a brief summary. The text discusses how rape cases remain hidden, so I'll phrase it simply.

Keywords should be relevant and limited to five. The main topics are sexual assault, statistics, Oklahoma, investigative reporting, and crime reporting.

Putting it all together, I structure each key with appropriate values, ensuring everything is in English and enclosed in quotes.
