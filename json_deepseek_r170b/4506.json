Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions about the structure of the JSON.

First, the ID is straightforward: it's given as 4506. Next, looking at the authors section. Howard Berkes from NPR is listed, but there's no other author mentioned. Since only one author is present, I'll create a list with just him. His email and affiliation aren't provided, so those will be null.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, and the year is 2015. The title of the tipsheet is "Investigating the Investigators." For the description, it should be a concise summary. I'll note that it's about strategies for journalists to examine regulatory agencies by identifying gaps in enforcement and using data.

Keywords need to be up to five terms. From the content, relevant keywords are "regulatory oversight," "investigative journalism," "FOIA requests," "agency accountability," and "data analysis." These capture the essence of the tipsheet without overlapping with conference or author names.

I'll structure all these elements into a JSON object as specified, ensuring each key is correctly named and values are properly enclosed in quotes. No extra information should be added beyond what's provided.
