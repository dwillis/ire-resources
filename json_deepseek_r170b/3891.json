Alright, so I need to create a JSON object from the given input based on specific instructions. Let me break down what's needed.

First, the structure should include id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is set as 3891. 

Looking at the input, there are two presenters: Coulter Jones from The Center for Investigative Reporting and Jessica Savage from Corpus Christi Caller-Times. So, each author entry in the JSON should have their name, email, and affiliation.

For emails, Coulter's is coulterjones@gmail.com, and Jessica's is jessica.savagesav@gmail.com. Affiliations are clear from the input, so I can include those.

The conference is mentioned as an IRE event since it's from Investigative Reporters and Editors. The year isn't explicitly stated in the text provided, so I'll set it to "Not Listed".

The title of the tipsheet seems to be "Using Data to Provide Context on Any Beat" based on the header. 

For the description, a concise summary: It should explain that the session covers finding and using data for journalism, including government sources and tools. So something like how to find and utilize data sources for deeper storytelling in any reporting area.

Keywords are next. The main points from the content are data journalism, government data, investigative reporting, local reporting, and public records. These capture the essence without being too broad.

I need to ensure that all values are properly quoted and that there's no markdown formatting. Also, each key in the JSON should be enclosed in double quotes as per the instructions.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part step by step to make sure nothing is missed.
