Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conferences. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with certain keys like id, authors, conference, year, etc.

First, let me parse the input text carefully. The title is "Investigative Echoes," which seems to be a checklist for managing the lifecycle of an investigative story after publication. There are 20 different echo strategies listed, each explaining how to keep the story relevant and engage the audience over time.

Now, looking at the authors section in the JSON. The user mentioned that if no author is listed, I should leave it as null. In this case, the text doesn't mention any specific authors, so the authors array will have an object with name set to null. The email and affiliation can also be null since there's no additional information provided.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE" because it's from Investigative Reporters and Editors conferences. As for the year, I don't see a specific year mentioned in the text, so according to instructions, I should set it to "Not Listed."

For the description, I need a concise 1-2 sentence summary of the tipsheet. The main idea is that it's a checklist for managing an investigative story's lifecycle post-publication with various echo strategies.

Keywords are next. They shouldn't include the conference or authors and should be no more than five terms. Looking at the content, relevant keywords could be "investigative journalism," "story lifecycle," "echo strategy," "audience engagement," and "post-publication planning."

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part as per the instructions: id is 5919, authors have a single object with nulls, conference is "IRE," year is "Not Listed," title from the input, description as crafted, and keywords as listed.

I need to ensure that all keys are enclosed in quotes and that the JSON syntax is correct. No markdown formatting should be present, just plain JSON. Let me double-check each part to make sure I didn't miss any details or misinterpret the instructions.

```json
{
  "id": 5919,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigative Echoes",
  "description": "A checklist for managing the lifecycle of a big investigative story after publication, including various echo strategies to maintain audience engagement and impact.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative journalism",
    "story lifecycle",
    "echo strategy",
    "audience engagement",
    "post-publication planning"
  ]
}
```
