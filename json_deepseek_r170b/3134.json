Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet regarding higher education money, specifically focusing on PHEAA stories.

First, I should parse through the provided text. The title is "Following the Money: The PHEAA Stories" and it's from 2008. The speaker mentioned is Jim Parsons from WTAE TV, so that will be under authors with his affiliation as WTAE TV.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, and the year is 2008 since the presentation date is June 13, 2008.

For the description, I'll summarize it in one or two sentences. It's about investigating PHEAA's finances and the legal battles over public records. That seems to capture the essence without getting too detailed.

Next, keywords should be relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. So, "Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency (PHEAA)", "public records", "financial investigations", "government accountability", and "open records law" fit well here.

I need to ensure all keys are in quotes and that the JSON structure is correct without any markdown formatting. Also, make sure there are no made-up names; since only Jim Parsons is mentioned, others can be null or omitted if not listed.

Finally, I'll assemble everything into a JSON object with the specified ID of 3134.
