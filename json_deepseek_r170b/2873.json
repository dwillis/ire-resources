Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, the id is specified as 2873, so that's straightforward. Next, authors: the text mentions Peter Karl but doesn't provide his email or affiliation. Since there's no news organization listed, I'll set name to "Peter Karl" and email/affiliation to null.

The conference is clearly IRE, so that goes in the conference key. The year isn't mentioned anywhere, so it should be "Not Listed".

For the title, looking at the tipsheet, it's about crime reporting tips by Peter Karl. So a suitable title would be "Crime Reporting Tips".

The description needs to be a concise summary. The main points are practical advice on investigating crime stories, finding information, avoiding mistakes, and building sources. So I'll phrase that into 1-2 sentences.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Relevant keywords here could be "crime reporting", "investigative journalism", "reporting tips", "journalism resources", and "legal protection" since those cover the main topics discussed.

I need to make sure all keys are in English, enclosed in quotes, and that there are no markdown formats. The JSON structure should have each key properly quoted with their respective values as per the instructions.
