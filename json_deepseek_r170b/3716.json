Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the user specified that the id should be 3716. That's straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors section. The tipsheet mentions Doug Haddix as the speaker. However, there are also thanks to Maloy Moore, Alice Hart Wertheim, and Marian Paynter from various newspapers. So I need to include all of them in the authors list. Each author entry should have name, email, and affiliation.

Doug's affiliation isn't directly listed next to his name, but since he presented at an IRE conference, it's safe to assume his affiliation is IRE. For Maloy Moore, the text mentions Los Angeles Times, so that will be her affiliation. Alice Hart Wertheim is from Atlanta Journal-Constitution, and Marian Paynter is from The Charlotte Observer.

Emails aren't provided for any of them, so those fields can remain null.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE National Conference in Boston with the year 2012. So conference will be "IRE" and year will be 2012.

For the title, the main heading is about uncovering private parts of public figures, but looking at the content, it's more focused on using public records to track people. The actual tipsheet starts with "Where do we leave tracks in documents, records and data?" So I'll use that as the title.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet provides various public records and resources for tracking individuals, including property records, court documents, etc. So I'll write a one-sentence summary capturing that essence.

Keywords should be no more than five terms excluding conference and authors. From the content, key topics include public records, property records, tracking people, campaign contributions, and personal financial disclosures. That makes five relevant keywords.

Putting it all together, I structure each part accordingly ensuring correct syntax and quotation marks.
