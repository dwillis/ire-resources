Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tutorial about creating flythroughs with Google Earth Pro at NICAR 2016. 

First, the id is given as 4726.

Looking for authors: The text doesn't list any specific names, so the authors array will have an element with name null and email and affiliation also null.

Conference is clearly stated as NICAR, so that's straightforward.

Year is mentioned as 2016 in the footer, so year should be 2016.

Title isn't explicitly given, but from the content, it's a tutorial on creating flythroughs, so I'll title it accordingly.

Description needs to be a brief summary. The text is about using Google Earth Pro for journalism, specifically creating flythroughs, so that's the basis of the description.

Keywords: Since the conference and authors are excluded, relevant terms could be "Google Earth Pro", "journalism tools", "flythroughs", "tutorial", "rendering". But I need to limit it to five. Maybe "Google Earth Pro" is too specific as a keyword, so perhaps focus on broader terms like "3D rendering", "geospatial visualization", etc.

Putting it all together, making sure everything's in English and properly enclosed in quotes.
