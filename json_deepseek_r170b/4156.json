Alright, so I've got this task to create a JSON object from a tipsheet provided by Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conferences. The user has specified that the response should only be a JSON object with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, I'll go through each key one by one to extract the necessary information. Starting with the id, it's given as 4156, so that's straightforward.

Next, the authors section is a list where each entry has name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the input, there are two speakers mentioned: Steven Rich from The Washington Post and Aaron Williams from CIR (which I know stands for Center for Investigative Reporting). Their emails are also provided. So, I'll create two author objects with their respective details.

For the conference, it's clear that this tipsheet is part of an IRE event because it mentions "IRE CAR bootcamps" and uses "ire.org" in links. So, the conference key should be "IRE".

The year isn't explicitly mentioned anywhere in the text, so I'll set it to "Not Listed". The title is clearly stated as "When to Scrape: Tools and techniques".

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary of 1-2 sentences. The tipsheet covers web scraping tools and techniques for journalists, including both no-code methods like Excel and more advanced Python scripting. It also touches on ethical considerations. So, I'll craft a brief summary that captures this essence.

Finally, keywords should include up to five relevant terms excluding the conference name and authors. Key topics here are web scraping, data journalism, tools, techniques, and ethics. These are all central to the content.

I think I've covered all the required fields now. Let me put it all together in JSON format as specified.

    {
      "name": "Aaron Williams",
      "email": "awilliams@cironline.org",
      "affiliation": "CIR (Center for Investigative Reporting)"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "When to Scrape: Tools and techniques",
  "description": "A session covering web scraping tools and techniques for journalists, including no-code methods using Excel and more advanced Python scripting.",
