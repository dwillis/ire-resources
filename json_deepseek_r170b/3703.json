Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given input. Let me start by understanding what's required.

First, the structure needs to have specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is given as 3703. 

Looking at the input, there's an author named Alison Young from USA TODAY with her email. I'll list her in the authors array. There are no other authors mentioned, so that's straightforward.

The conference isn't explicitly stated here, but since it's about investigative reporters and tipsheets, I think it might be an IRE (Investigative Reporters and Editors) event. So, I'll set conference to "IRE". The year isn't provided, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

For the title, the input mentions "Using Archives and Historical Records for Environmental and Land Use Investigations", which seems fitting.

The description needs a 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet talks about using historical records like Sanborn maps and other archival materials to investigate environmental issues. I'll condense that into a clear, concise sentence.

Keywords should be relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, "Sanborn Maps", "Environmental Investigations", "Historical Records", "Land Use", and "Archival Research" seem appropriate and within the five-term limit.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each key with the correct values, ensuring proper formatting and enclosing everything in quotes as per JSON standards.
