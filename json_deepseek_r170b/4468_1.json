Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down what's needed step by step.

First, the id should be "4468_1". Thatâ€™s straightforward. Next, the authors section requires a list of objects each with name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the input, I see Scott Friedman from NBC5/KXAS-TV Dallas-Fort Worth with his email, Keli Rabon from ABC13 Houston with her email, and Scott Zamost from CNN, though his email is provided as well. So, I can list all three with their respective details.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's easy. The year is given as 2015 in the title, so year will be 2015. The title of the tipsheet is "Broadcast: How to Get People to Talk".

For the description, it should be a concise summary. The tipsheet offers techniques for securing on-camera interviews with victims, insiders, and reluctant officials. So I'll phrase that into one or two sentences.

Keywords are next. They need to be no more than five terms excluding the conference and authors. Relevant keywords from the content could be "on-camera interviews", "investigative reporting", "interview techniques", "public officials", and "source relationships". That makes five, so I'll use those.

I should ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, make sure that any missing information is left as null, but in this case, all authors have names, emails, and affiliations except for maybe their titles, which aren't needed here.

Double-checking everything: id, authors with correct details, conference set to IRE, year 2015, a clear title, a concise description, and relevant keywords. Seems like I covered all the requirements.
