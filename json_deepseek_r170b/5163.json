Alright, so I'm trying to create this JSON object based on the input provided. Let me break down what needs to be done step by step.

First, I see that the id should be 5163. That's straightforward. Next, the authors section is a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. The instructions say not to make up any names and leave them as null if they aren't listed. Looking at the text, I don't see any specific authors mentioned except Aimee Edmondson in one part. So, I'll include her with her name, but email and affiliation can be null since there's no information provided.

Moving on to the conference key. The input mentions both "IRE" and "NICAR" conferences, so it makes sense to list both under conference. However, if only one is applicable, I need to choose appropriately. But here, since both are mentioned, I'll include them as a list.

For the year, I check the text but don't see any specific year mentioned for when this was published or presented. So, according to instructions, it should be "Not Listed".

The title isn't provided in the input, so I have to come up with a relevant one based on the content. It seems to focus on Excel tutorials and calculations, so a title like "Excel Tutorials and Calculations Guide" fits well.

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary of the text. The text covers various Excel functions, population change calculations, and data analysis tips. So, summarizing that into one or two sentences should capture the essence without being too wordy.

Keywords are next. I need up to five terms excluding conference names and authors. Looking at the content, "Excel", "Data Analysis", "Population Change", "Percent Change", and "Spreadsheet Calculations" seem relevant and specific enough.

I also have to ensure that all keys and values are in English since the original text is in English. Additionally, all strings must be enclosed in quotes as per JSON standards.

Let me double-check each section:

- id: 5163 (correct)
- authors: Only Aimee Edmondson mentioned, others not listed, so one author object with name and nulls for email and affiliation.
- conference: Both IRE and NICAR are referenced, so list both.
- year: Not specified in the text, so "Not Listed".
- title: Created a suitable title based on content.
- description: Concise summary covering Excel functions, calculations, and data analysis.
- keywords: Five relevant terms.

I think that covers everything. I should structure it properly with commas separating list items and ensure proper JSON syntax without any errors.

  "id": "5163",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Excel Tutorials and Calculations Guide",
  "description": "A guide covering various Excel functions and calculations, including population change analysis and data formatting tips.",
  "keywords": [
    "Excel",
    "Data Analysis",
    "Population Change",
    "Percent Change",
    "Spreadsheet Calculations"
  ]
}
