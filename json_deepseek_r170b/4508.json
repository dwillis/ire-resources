Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Margot Williams at The Intercept for the IRE conference in June 2015.

First, I'll set the id as 4508 since that's specified. 

Next, under authors, there's only one author mentioned: Margot Williams with her email and affiliation to The Intercept. So, the authors array will have one object with name "Margot Williams", email "margot.williams@theintercept.com", and affiliation "The Intercept".

The conference is clearly IRE, so that goes into the conference field. The year is June 2015, which translates to 2015.

For the title, looking at the content, it's about various research resources, so a fitting title would be "Research Resources for Investigative Journalists".

In the description, I need a concise summary. It's a tipsheet covering online tools and databases useful in investigative journalism, so that becomes the description.

Keywords should include up to five terms. The main areas covered are research resources, investigative journalism, online tools, databases, and journalism. These make sense as keywords.

I'll structure all this into a JSON object with appropriate keys and ensure all values are enclosed in quotes. No markdown is needed here since it's just the JSON.
