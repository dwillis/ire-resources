Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has specified certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, looking at the input, the id is clearly T2011 as per the instruction. 

Next, for authors, Jeff South is listed along with his affiliation to VA Commonwealth University School of Mass Comm. His email isn't provided, so it should be null. So the authors array will have one object with name "Jeff South", email null, and affiliation "VA Commonwealth University School of Mass Comm".

The conference mentioned in the text is the National Computer-Assisted Reporting Conference, which I recognize as part of NICAR, so the conference key should be "NICAR". The year is given as March 14, 2004, so that's straightforward.

The title of the tipsheet isn't explicitly stated but can be inferred from the content. It's about integrating CAR into other courses, so a suitable title would be "Integrating Computer-Assisted Reporting (CAR) into Journalism and Communications Courses".

For the description, it needs to be a concise summary. The main points are the reasons for incorporating CAR skills and methods of integration. So I'll write that it discusses integrating CAR into existing curricula for improved journalism.

Keywords should include relevant terms from the content: "computer-assisted reporting", "CAR", "journalism education", "data analysis", "precision journalism". I need to limit this to five, so those seem appropriate.

I have to ensure all keys and values are in quotes, no markdown, and everything is correctly formatted as per JSON standards. Also, avoid making up any information; if it's not present, leave it null or as specified.
