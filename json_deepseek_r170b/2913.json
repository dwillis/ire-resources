Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. Let me start by understanding what they're asking for. They provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference in Denver back in 2005. The panel was about contacts and resources for international investigations, focusing on Mexico and Latin America.

First, I'll identify the key elements: id is given as E2913 or T2465, but since the instruction says to use 2913, that's straightforward. The authors are mentioned as Pedro Enrique Armenares from Centro de Periodistas de Investigación. Since there might be other speakers not listed, I'll just include him with his name and affiliation, leaving email null.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE", so that's set. Year is 2005, which is explicitly given. The title in Spanish translates to something about contacts and resources for international investigations, so I can create a concise English title like "Contacts and Resources for International Investigations."

For the description, it should be a brief summary. The tipsheet provides resources for journalists investigating in Mexico and Latin America, listing organizations and tools. So I'll write that it's a guide offering key contacts and resources.

Keywords are next. I need up to five terms excluding conference and authors. "International investigations," "Latin America," "Mexico," "journalism resources," and "investigative journalism" seem appropriate.

I should make sure all keys are in English, properly quoted, and that the JSON structure is correct without any markdown formatting as per their instructions. Also, ensure that no information is made up; if it's not there, like other authors, they stay null or omitted.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each key with the corresponding value, making sure everything aligns with what's provided and the user's specifications.
