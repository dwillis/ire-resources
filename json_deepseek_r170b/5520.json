Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to create this JSON object from the given tipsheet about investigating the police. The user has specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, the id is straightforwardâ€”5520. Next, authors. The tipsheet only mentions David Migoya, so his name goes in as a string. Since there's no email or affiliation listed except "The Denver Post," I'll note that as his affiliation.

For the conference, it's not explicitly stated, so I'll set it to "Not Listed." The year is also missing, so that's "Not Listed" too. 

The title should be the main topic, which seems to be "Investigating the Police." Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. Looking at the content, it focuses on methods for journalists to investigate police conduct using records and data analysis.

Keywords are next. I'll pick relevant terms like police accountability, public records, data journalism, internal investigations, and law enforcement. These capture the essence without overlapping with the conference or authors.

Putting it all together, each key is filled as per instructions, ensuring everything is in English and properly quoted.
