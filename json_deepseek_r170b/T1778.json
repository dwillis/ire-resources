Okay, so I need to create a JSON object from the given input with specific keys. The id is T1778, as provided. 

Looking at the authors section, there's only one person mentioned: David Charles Donald. His email is ddonald@savannahnow.com and he works at Savannah Morning News. So his affiliation will be that news organization.

The conference was NICAR in Charlotte, N.C., back in 2003. So the conference key should be "NICAR" and the year is 2003. 

For the title, it's given as "Making an Index for Environmental Surveys". The description needs to be a concise summary. I'll go with explaining how he created an index using survey questions to measure pro-development vs. pro-environmental attitudes.

Keywords should include terms like environment, surveys, development, data analysis, and scale creation. 

I need to make sure all the keys are in quotes and values are properly formatted. No markdown, just plain JSON.
