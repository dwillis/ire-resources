Okay, I need to figure out how to create the JSON object as per the user's query. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, looking at the input, it seems like it's a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference about using drones in journalism. The title mentions "Drones for journalism" so that should be straightforward.

The user wants specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. 

For the 'id', they specified it as DronesForJournalism_1, which is clear.

Now, 'authors' is a list where each element has name, email, and affiliation. The input doesn't mention any author names, so I'll set name to null. Email and affiliation can also be null since there's no info provided.

The conference is definitely IRE because the content is from an IRE tipsheet.

Year isn't mentioned in the text, so it should be "Not Listed".

The description needs a 1-2 sentence summary. The main points are discussing the potential of drones in journalism, challenges like cost and regulations, and future possibilities once FAA rules are set. So I'll craft a concise summary capturing that.

Keywords should be up to five relevant terms excluding conference and authors. Looking at the content, 'drones', 'journalism', 'FAA', 'ethics', 'technology' seem appropriate.

I also need to ensure all values are in English and keys are properly enclosed in quotes. No markdown, just plain JSON.

Double-checking everything to make sure I didn't miss any requirements. Looks good!
