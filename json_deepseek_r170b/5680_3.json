Okay, so I need to figure out how to create this JSON object based on the user's query. They provided some tips from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference, specifically from Leslie Eaton. The task is to structure this information into a JSON with specific keys.

First, let's break down the requirements. The JSON should have id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id given is 5680_3. 

Looking at the authors section, it's a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. In the provided text, Leslie Eaton is mentioned with her email leaton@dallasnews.com and she's affiliated with The Dallas Morning News. So I can fill that in without any nulls.

The conference is IRE since it's from an IRE event. The year isn't specified here, so I'll put "Not Listed". 

For the title, the user mentioned tips on story structure and writing for investigations. I'll make that concise: "Tips on Story Structure and Writing for Investigations".

The description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. The key points are about engaging readers through structure and narrative techniques like hooks and chronology.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. From the text, relevant keywords could be "investigative journalism", "story structure", "writing tips", "engagement", "narrative techniques".

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part accordingly, ensuring proper formatting with quotes and commas where needed. Also, making sure to avoid any markdown as per the user's instruction.
