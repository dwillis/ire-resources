Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a block of text from what seems to be an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. They want me to convert this into a specific JSON object with defined keys.

First, I need to identify each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 5240. 

Next, the authors section is a list of objects, each containing name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the text, David Armstrong is listed with his email and affiliation as Georgia State University through the Georgia News Lab. So I'll include him in the authors array.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE 2017, so conference is "IRE" and year is 2017. The title seems to be "Tips for Teaching Investigative Reporting."

For the description, it needs to be a concise summary. The text provides tips on recruiting students, early preparation, training, project selection, collaboration with professionals, and communication. I'll condense this into one or two sentences focusing on these key points.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords include "investigative reporting," "teaching tips," "journalism education," "student projects," and "collaboration."

I also need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes without any markdown. Double-checking that no information is made up, especially since there's only one author provided.

Putting it all together, the JSON structure should accurately reflect each part of the tipsheet as per the user's instructions.
