Alright, so I need to create a JSON object from the given input based on the user's query. The input seems to be a series of slides or notes from various presentations at a conference. Each slide has different authors, titles, and descriptions.

First, I should parse each presentation to extract relevant information. Let me go through them one by one.

1. **IRE19 Presentation**: It talks about tracking sexual misconduct in Texas. The authors are Jordan Rubio and Nicole Hensley from the Houston Chronicle. So their emails and affiliation are provided. The description is about creating a database of accused priests, which I can summarize. Keywords would include "sexual misconduct," "database," etc.

2. **Another Slide**: This one is about an ICE detention facility in California by Kerry Klein. It describes how she uncovered the facility using various methods like FOIA requests and data analysis. Authors are Kerry Klein with her email and affiliation at Valley Public Radio. The description should focus on uncovering the secret facility and transparency issues.

3. **Nightlife Investigation**: Chris Glorioso from WNBC-TV investigated club promoters targeting underage women. The slide discusses the harms like underage drinking and duty of care in clubs. So the authors are Chris with his contact info, and keywords related to nightlife and underage issues.

4. **Other Topics**: There's a mention of ICE detention, sexual misconduct, and club promotions. These seem to be different presentations but part of the same conference, likely IRE19 based on one of the slides.

Now, each presentation needs to be a separate JSON object with the specified keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is 5849 for all since they're part of the same input. Conference is "IRE" as indicated in one slide, and year is "2019" from IRE19.

For each author section, if emails are provided, include them; otherwise, leave as null. Affiliations come from their news organizations mentioned. Descriptions should be concise, capturing the main point of each investigation.

I need to ensure that all values are in English and correctly formatted. Also, keywords are limited to five relevant terms, excluding conference names or authors. Each JSON object will represent one presentation's data as per the user's instructions.

  "title": "Investigative Reporting and Data Journalism Presentations",
  "description": "A collection of investigative reporting projects presented at a conference, covering topics like sexual misconduct tracking, ICE detention facilities, and nightlife investigations.",
