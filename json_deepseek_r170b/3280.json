Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id is given as 3280, so that's straightforward.

Looking at the authors section, Anthony DeBarros is listed along with his affiliation, USA TODAY. Since there are no other authors mentioned, the list will only have one entry. His name is provided, but email isn't, so it'll be null. Affiliation is clearly stated as USA TODAY.

The conference location is IRE 2009 in Baltimore, so the conference key should be "IRE" and the year is 2009.

For the title, the tipsheet's title is "PROGRAMMING: LEARN THE BASIC LINGO AND GAIN NEW POWERS".

Next, the description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet emphasizes learning programming basics for tasks like data extraction and automation. So, I'll summarize that it helps journalists handle repetitive tasks efficiently through programming.

Keywords should include relevant terms without mentioning the conference or authors. Programming, automation, data analysis, web development, and efficiency are all key points from the text.

Putting it all together, each field is filled accordingly, ensuring no made-up information and following the specified structure.
