Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let's break down the requirements step by step.

First, the id is given as 5488, so that's straightforward. Next, authors should be a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the input, Angelica McKinley and Lena Groeger are the speakers. Their emails are @angelicadesigns and @lenagroeger, but since emails aren't provided beyond the handles, I'll set them to null. There's no explicit news organization mentioned, so their affiliations will also be null.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that goes into the conference field. The year isn't mentioned in the input, so it defaults to "Not Listed". 

For the title, the main heading is "Design for Non-Designers", which makes sense. The description needs to be a concise summary of the tipsheet's content. The presenters discuss design principles like contrast, alignment, repetition, and hierarchy, all aimed at non-designers in journalism.

Keywords should include up to five relevant terms. From the input, "design principles", "non-designers", "contrast", "alignment", and "hierarchy" are key concepts mentioned multiple times. These will be my keywords.

Putting it all together, I structure each field as per the instructions, ensuring that all values are in English and enclosed in quotes.
