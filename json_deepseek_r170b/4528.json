Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has provided a set of slides with various data points about real estate trends, specifically presented by Skylar Olsen from Zillow.

First, I'll start by identifying each required field for the JSON structure:

1. **id**: The user specified it should be 4528.
2. **authors**: This is a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. In the slides, only Skylar Olsen is mentioned as the presenter, with her title being Senior Economist at Zillow. There's no email provided, so that will be null.
3. **conference**: The user mentioned this is from an IRE conference, so it should be "IRE".
4. **year**: Looking through the slides, there's no specific year mentioned, so it will default to "Not Listed".
5. **title**: The title of the presentation seems to be about using real estate data to tell community stories.
6. **description**: A concise summary. I'll need to capture that this session talks about how journalists can use Zillow's data to report on housing trends, covering aspects like home values and affordability issues.
7. **keywords**: Up to five relevant terms from the content, such as "real estate data", "Zillow", "housing market", "home affordability", and "journalism".

I need to ensure that all these elements are correctly formatted in JSON with proper quotation marks and structure. Also, since there's no explicit year, I won't include it. The authors section only includes Skylar Olsen with her affiliation as Zillow.

Now, putting this all together into a JSON object.

```json
{
  "id": 4528,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Skylar Olsen",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Zillow"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Tell Stories About Your Community With Real Estate Data",
  "description": "Learn how to use real estate data from Zillow to tell compelling stories about your community, covering topics like home values, inventory, sales, and forecasts.",
  "keywords": [
    "real estate data",
    "Zillow",
    "housing market",
    "home affordability",
    "journalism"
  ]
}
```
