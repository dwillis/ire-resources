Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each requirement step by step.

First, the id is 3443 as specified. Next, looking for authors. The tipsheet mentions Nigel Jaquiss from Willamette Week. There's no email provided, so that will be null. Affiliation is clearly Willamette Week.

The conference is IRE since it's from an IRE event. The year isn't explicitly mentioned, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed". 

For the title, the tipsheet is titled "Investigating Local Government" by Nigel Jaquiss. The description should be a concise summary. The tipsheet focuses on using documents and sources to investigate local government, so the description will reflect that.

Keywords need to be up to five terms. Looking at the content, "Local Government", "Investigative Reporting", "Public Records", "Documents", and "Sources" are all relevant.

Putting it all together, I structure each part into the JSON object ensuring all keys are enclosed in quotes and values are correctly formatted.

```json
{
  "id": "3443",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Nigel Jaquiss",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Willamette Week"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigating Local Government",
  "description": "This tipsheet provides strategies for investigating local government by focusing on key players, documents and sources.",
  "keywords": [
    "Local Government",
    "Investigative Reporting",
    "Public Records",
    "Documents",
    "Sources"
  ]
}
```
