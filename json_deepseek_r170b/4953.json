Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the tipsheet provided about Carto basics from an IRE conference. Let me go through each key step by step.

First, the id is given as 4953. That's straightforward.

Next, authors. The tipsheet was written by CJ Sinner, with their Twitter handle and affiliation with StarTribune. Since only one author is listed, the authors array will have one object. Name is "CJ Sinner", email isn't provided so it'll be null, and affiliation is "StarTribune".

Conference is IRE because the tipsheet mentions being from Investigative Reporters and Editors conferences.

The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the text, so I'll set it to "Not Listed".

Title is clearly "Carto basics", as that's the header of the tipsheet.

For description, I need a 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet covers how to use Carto for mapping data, including geocoding, merging datasets, and creating maps. So the description should capture that succinctly.

Keywords are up to five terms related to the content but excluding conference and authors. Relevant keywords might be "Carto", "mapping", "data visualization", "geocoding", "GIS".

Now, putting it all together into a JSON structure with proper syntax.

```json
{
  "id": 4953,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "CJ Sinner",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "StarTribune"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Carto basics",
  "description": "A guide on using Carto for mapping data, including geocoding, merging datasets, and creating visualizations.",
  "keywords": [
    "Carto",
    "mapping",
    "data visualization",
    "geocoding"
  ]
}
```
