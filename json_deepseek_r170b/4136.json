Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given query. The user provided some specific instructions, so let me break this down step by step.

First, the id is set to 4136 as per the user's instruction. Next, looking at the authors section: there’s only one author mentioned, Ronald Campbell, with his email and phone number. His affiliation isn't explicitly stated, but since he didn’t list a news organization, I should leave it null.

Now, for the conference field, the user mentioned that it could be "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". In this case, the document is from an IRE conference tipsheet, so I'll set conference to "IRE".

The year isn't provided in the text, so according to the instructions, it should be "Not Listed". The title of the tipsheet is clear: "Documents to Live By".

For the description, I need a concise 1-2 sentence summary. The document lists various public records like court, land, and business records, so summarizing that makes sense.

Keywords are next. They can't exceed five terms and shouldn’t include the conference or authors. From the content, key areas are court records, land records, business records, nonprofit records, and public documents. That gives me five relevant keywords.

Putting it all together, each section is filled with the extracted information, ensuring that all fields match the user’s specifications without adding any made-up data.
