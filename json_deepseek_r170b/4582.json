Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through this step by step.

First, looking at the input, the title is "Cracking the Political Piggy Bank" and it's presented by Ben Wieder from The Center for Public Integrity. His email is bwieder@publicintegrity.org and his Twitter handle is @benbwieder. So, under authors, I should list him with his name, email, and affiliation.

Next, the conference isn't explicitly mentioned in the input, but since it's about political money and data tools like FEC viewers and others, it's likely from a NICAR conference which focuses on data journalism. However, the user instruction says if the conference isn't clearly identified, use "Not Listed". But wait, in this case, I think the resources include a link to NICAR2015, so maybe it is NICAR 2015? Wait, the initial processing didn't specify the year, but looking at the hands-on data links and additional resources, one of them has NICAR2015 in the URL. So perhaps the conference is NICAR and the year is 2015.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet seems to provide tools and resources for tracking political money, so I can write that it's about investigative reporting on political financing with various data tools.

Keywords should include terms like "political finance", "campaign contributions", etc., up to five terms excluding the conference and authors.

So putting this together:

- id is 4582 as specified.
- authors list has Ben Wieder with his details. No other authors are listed, so only one entry.
- conference is NICAR since it's related to data journalism and there's a reference to NICAR2015.
- year would be 2015 because of the URL indicating NICAR2015.
- title remains as given.
- description is a short summary about tools for tracking political money in campaigns.
- keywords are relevant terms without including the conference or author names.

I think that covers all the requirements. Let me structure this into JSON now, making sure to use correct syntax and include all necessary fields with proper quotations.
