Alright, I'm looking at this query where the user wants me to create a JSON object from some provided text about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The instructions are quite detailed.

First, the user mentions that the response must be only a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. They also specify that the id should be 5085. So I'll start by noting that down.

Next, they talk about the authors section being a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. In the provided text, Al Shaw is clearly mentioned along with his email and affiliation to ProPublica. Since there's only one author listed, the authors array will have just one object.

The conference is specified as either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". The text includes #NICAR17, so I know it's a NICAR conference. The year isn't explicitly mentioned, but since NICAR17 likely refers to 2017, that should be the year value.

For the title and description, I'll extract the main idea from the content. The tipsheet is about finding great stories in academic papers, so the title would reflect that. The description needs to be a concise summary of what the text coversâ€”essentially how journalists can collaborate with academics by understanding their research and presenting it accessibly.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking at the content, keywords like "academic papers", "collaboration", "data analysis", "storytelling", and "journalism" seem appropriate as they capture the essence without including the conference or author names.

I also need to ensure that all keys and values are in English and enclosed in quotes. Since there's no mention of other languages, this should be straightforward. All the data from the text fits neatly into the required structure without needing any assumptions beyond what's provided.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with each key as specified, making sure to format everything correctly. Each part is filled based on the instructions and the content given, ensuring no made-up information is added.
