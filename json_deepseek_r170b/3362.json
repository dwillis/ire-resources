Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference titled "The Latest in Mapping" by Clem Henriksen from ESRI. They want me to convert this into a specific JSON format with certain keys.

First, I need to extract the id, which is given as 3362. Then, look for authors. The tipsheet mentions Clem Henriksen and ESRI, but there's no email or more affiliations beyond ESRI, so I'll set name to "Clem Henriksen" and affiliation to "ESRI", with email null.

Next, the conference is clearly IRE since that's part of the user's context. The year isn't provided, so it should be "Not Listed". 

For the title, it's straightforward: "The Latest in Mapping". The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers mapping technology trends like hybrid mashups and server complexity, so I'll summarize that.

Keywords should include up to five terms from the content. Looking through the links and topics, "mapping", "GIS", "mashups", "cloud computing", and "data services" are relevant.

Putting it all together, I structure each key accordingly, ensuring all values are in English and properly quoted as per JSON standards.
