Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given query and data. The user has provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference, specifically NICAR 2017 in Jacksonville, Fla. 

First, I'll identify each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The id should be "CriminalJusticeNicar2017" as per the user's instruction.

Next, the authors section. The tipsheet lists Andy Lehren from The New York Times. Since there are no other authors mentioned, I'll create a list with one object containing his details. His name is provided, but email and affiliation aren't specified except for the news organization, so affiliation will be "The New York Times".

For the conference, it's NICAR 2017, so I'll set that as the value. The year is clearly listed as 2017.

The title of the tipsheet is "Investigating Bias and Influence in Criminal Justice".

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. Looking at the content, the tipsheet covers checking literature, learning relevant math, thinking outside the box, and using data for storytelling. So I'll craft a 1-2 sentence summary that encapsulates these points.

Keywords should be no more than five terms related to the content. The main topics are criminal justice, bias, influence, data journalism, and investigative reporting. I'll list those as keywords.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. No markdown or extra textâ€”just a clean JSON object.
