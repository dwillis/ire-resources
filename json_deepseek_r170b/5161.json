Okay, so I have to create a JSON object based on this tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me read through the user's query carefully.

First, they provided a structure with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 5161. Got it.

Looking at the authors section, I need to extract the name, email, and affiliation. In the document, Christopher Baxter is listed as the Investigative Editor & Reporter for NJ Advance Media, which includes The Star-Ledger & NJ.com. His contact info is cbaxter@njadvancemedia.com and phone number (973) 943-9130. Since only the email is relevant here, I'll include that.

Next, the conference is clearly IRE, as mentioned in the tipsheet title. The year isn't provided, so it should be "Not Listed".

The title of the tipsheet is "8 Steps To Making a Big Investigative Splash". 

For the description, I need to summarize the content in 1-2 sentences. The tipsheet outlines eight steps for creating an impact with investigative journalism, focusing on marketing, partnerships, and outreach strategies.

Keywords should be up to five terms. Looking at the content, relevant keywords would be "investigative journalism", "marketing plan", "partnerships", "outreach strategy", and "impact".

Putting it all together, I structure each part into the JSON format as per the instructions, ensuring all keys are enclosed in quotes and values are correctly formatted.
