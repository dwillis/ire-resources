Okay, I'm trying to create a JSON object from the given input based on the user's instructions. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the user has provided a chunk of text that includes references, findings, and some examples related to how the Internet is influencing international investigative journalism. The task is to extract specific information from this text to form a JSON object with keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The id should be T599 as specified. Next, for the authors, I need to look through the text to find any listed authors. In the findings section, there are mentions of people like Brant Houston and Anthony Collings. These seem to be contributors or authors cited in the examples provided. Since their affiliations aren't explicitly mentioned next to their names, but they might be associated with organizations like IRE (Investigative Reporters and Editors) or Nieman Reports, which is a publication from the Nieman Foundation. So, I'll assign those as their affiliations.

The conference key should be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Looking at the text, it mentions the University of Missouri's National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting (NICAR). Therefore, any references to that would fall under NICAR. However, in this case, since the examples provided don't explicitly tie Brant Houston and Anthony Collings to a specific conference, I think "Not Listed" is appropriate.

For the year, the text includes mentions of 1999 and 2000 in the context of when certain articles were published or events occurred. But without a clear indication that these are the years of a conference or event related to the JSON object's focus, it might be safer to set this as "Not Listed".

The title is straightforward; from the findings section, the main heading is about how the Internet influences international investigative newsgathering, so I can use that as the title.

The description should be a concise summary of the text. The text discusses how the Internet aids journalists in gathering information, especially in regions with limited infrastructure, and facilitates collaboration. So, summarizing this into one or two sentences would capture the essence.

Keywords are to be up to five terms excluding conference names and authors. From the content, relevant keywords could include "Internet", "investigative journalism", "newsgathering", "international cooperation", and "technology".

Putting it all together, I'll structure each key with appropriate values based on the above reasoning.
