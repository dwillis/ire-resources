Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. The input provided seems to be a tipsheet from Carolyn Edds for the NICAR conference in 2007. 

First, let me break down what each part of the JSON should include. The id is given as 2836, so that's straightforward.

Next, authors. I see Carolyn Edds is listed as the preparer. Her email and affiliation aren't provided, but since she's affiliated with the St. Petersburg Times, I'll note that as her affiliation.

The conference is clearly stated as NICAR, held in Cleveland in 2007, so the year is 2007. The title of the tipsheet isn't explicitly mentioned, but it's about backgrounding techniques, so I can use a descriptive title like "Backgrounding Techniques and Public Records Tips."

For the description, I need to summarize the content concisely. Itâ€™s a guide on using public records for investigative reporting, covering various sources like property records, court documents, etc.

Keywords should be relevant terms that capture the essence without being too broad. I'll go with "backgrounding techniques," "public records," "investigative journalism," and "research methods."

I must ensure all keys are in quotes and the structure is correct. No markdown or extra text should be included beyond the JSON.
