Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on the structure, so let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll start by identifying all the required keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 5390, so that's straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors section. The tipsheet mentions Christopher Schnaars from USA TODAY. His email and Twitter handle are provided, but since the user wants only name, email, and affiliation, I'll extract those. The affiliation will be "USA TODAY" because it's listed next to his name.

Now, for the conference. The URL in the resources section includes "nicar18," which stands for the 2018 NICAR conference. So, the conference key should be "NICAR", and the year is 2018 since that's when the event took place.

The title of the tipsheet is clearly "Wagging the Dog: Using Campaign Finance Data to Cover the Midterm Election." That makes it easy for the title field.

Moving on to the description. It needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet focuses on using campaign finance data, specifically mentioning donors and PACs. So, I'll craft a 1-2 sentence summary that captures how journalists can use this data to cover elections effectively.

For keywords, I need up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking at the content, relevant terms are "campaign finance," "election coverage," "PACs," "donors," and "Super PACs." These accurately represent the tipsheet's focus.

I should double-check that all values are in English and properly quoted. Also, ensure that any missing information is handled correctly, like not making up names or affiliations if they're not provided.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each key with its corresponding value, ensuring correct syntax for the JSON object.
