Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to create this JSON object based on the given tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors conferences. The user wants me to generate a response that's only a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, I'll note that the id is 6019 as specified. Next, looking at the authors section. The tipsheet lists Rachana Pradhan from Kaiser Health News and Marshall Allen from ProPublica. So each author object should have a name, email, and affiliation. Since emails aren't provided, they'll be null. Affiliations are clear from their respective organizations.

The conference is mentioned as IRE, so that's straightforward. The year isn't specified in the text, so it will default to "Not Listed". The title of the tipsheet is "36 COVID-19 Story Ideas in 30 Minutes".

For the description, I need a concise summary of the content. It's a list of story ideas and resources for journalists covering COVID-19, touching on hospitals, nursing homes, testing, disparities, etc.

Keywords should be no more than five terms, excluding conference and authors. So I'll pick relevant terms like "COVID-19", "journalism resources", "story ideas", "public health", and "investigative reporting".

Putting it all together, each part of the JSON is filled accordingly, making sure everything is properly quoted and formatted.
