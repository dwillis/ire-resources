Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided detailed instructions, so I should follow them step by step.

First, the structure of the JSON is specified with keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is 4808 as per the input.

Looking at the authors section, it's a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. The text mentions three veteran journalists but doesn't provide their names, emails, or affiliations. So I'll set each author's name to null, and email and affiliation will also be null since there's no information provided.

The conference is IRE because the document is from an IRE event. The year isn't clearly stated in the text, so it should be "Not Listed".

For the title, the main heading is "Following the Money," which seems appropriate. The description needs to be a concise summary of 1-2 sentences. The tipsheet discusses tracking financial activities through records and tools like spreadsheets, so I'll craft a simple sentence reflecting that.

Keywords should be up to five terms. From the content, relevant keywords could be "financial tracking," "investigative reporting," "spreadsheets," "suspicious activity reports (SARs)," and "derisking."

I also need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes without any markdown formatting.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, making sure each part aligns with the instructions provided.
