Alright, I'm trying to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON.

First, I need to identify all the required keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is 4171 as specified. 

Looking at the input, there are three presenters: Noah Pransky from WTSP-TV, Tampa Bay; David Kidwell from Chicago Tribune; and Charles Territo from American Traffic Solutions. I'll list them in the authors array with their respective details.

The conference is clearly labeled as IRE 2014, so the conference key will be "IRE" and the year is 2014. The title of the tipsheet is "Red Light Camera Story Ideas."

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet discusses how to investigate red light cameras focusing on profit vs. safety, crash statistics, and industry influence. So, I'll craft a brief sentence capturing that essence.

Keywords should be up to five terms. Relevant ones from the content are "red light cameras," "traffic enforcement," "profit vs. safety," "crash statistics," and "lobbying." These encapsulate the main topics without including conference or author names.

I need to ensure all values are in English, enclosed in quotes, and that any missing information is set to null. For example, since emails are provided for each author, I'll include those. Affiliations are taken from their respective news organizations or companies.

Putting it all together, I structure the JSON with these elements, making sure each key is properly quoted and the data aligns correctly.
