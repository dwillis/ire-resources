Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. The input provided is from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet titled "The Rolling Investigation." There are three authors mentioned: Mark Mazzetti, Jeremy Rogalski, and Ziva Branstetter.

First, I'll start by identifying each key in the JSON object as per the user's instructions. The id is given as 5681. 

For the authors section, each author should have name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the input, Mark Mazzetti is affiliated with The New York Times, Jeremy Rogalski with KHOU-TV, and Ziva Branstetter with Reveal. None of them have emails listed, so those will be null.

Next, the conference is clearly IRE since it's mentioned in the title. The year isn't provided, so that will be "Not Listed." 

The title should be "The Rolling Investigation," which is straightforward from the input. 

The description needs to be a concise summary. I'll note that it provides tips on managing and executing rolling investigations effectively.

Keywords are up to five terms. From the content, relevant keywords include "investigative reporting," "rolling investigation," "journalism best practices," "newsroom collaboration," and "story development strategies."

Putting it all together, each part is filled out according to the guidelines, ensuring that no made-up data is included and all affiliations are correctly noted based on the provided text.
