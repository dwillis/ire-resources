Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through this step by step.

First, I'll identify each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The id is given as 3367, so that's straightforward.

Next, the authors section. The tipsheet was presented by Alex Richards from the Las Vegas Sun. Thereâ€™s no email provided, so I'll leave that null. Affiliation is clearly the Las Vegas Sun.

Conference is either IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed. Since this is from an IRE conference, it should be "IRE".

The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the text, so I'll put "Not Listed" for the year.

For the title, it seems to be about Census lookups and quick facts, specifically from CAR 2010. So the title would be "Census Lookups and Quick Facts - CAR 2010".

Description needs to be a concise summary of the tipsheet. The document covers various tools on the Census site like American FactFinder, GIS shapefiles, population estimates, etc., so I'll mention those key points in one or two sentences.

Keywords should be up to five terms related to the content but excluding conference and authors. Relevant keywords would be "Census data", "American FactFinder", "GIS shapefiles", "population estimates", "public sector employment".

Putting it all together, I structure each part accordingly, ensuring proper formatting with quotation marks and correct syntax.
