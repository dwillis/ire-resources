Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id is given as 5776. That's straightforward. Next, the authors section. The names listed are Emilia Díaz-Struck, Margot Williams, and Karrie Kehoe. Their emails and affiliations aren't provided, so I'll set those to null. But since they're associated with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), as indicated by @icijorg and www.icij.org, their affiliation should be "International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ)".

The conference is clearly stated as NICAR 2019, so I'll note that under conference. The year is also clear from the context as 2019. For the title, it's about connecting health data, specifically the Implant Files case, so "Connecting the Dots with Health Data: The Implant Files Case" seems appropriate.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet discusses how medical devices can cause harm despite their benefits, issues with regulation, and the use of data to investigate these problems. So, I'll write it as a 1-2 sentence summary highlighting these points.

Keywords should include terms like "medical devices," "Implant Files," "data journalism," "FDA," and "patient safety." These are relevant without including the conference or authors.

I also need to ensure all keys and values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. No markdown, just a clean JSON structure.
