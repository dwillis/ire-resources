Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down the requirements step by step.

First, identify the id which is provided as 3918. That's straightforward.

Next, look at the authors section. There are four authors listed: Sally Kestin, Nate Carlisle, Lawrence Mower, and Shawn McIntosh. Each has their email and affiliation. I should structure each author with name, email, and affiliation. If any of these details are missing, they should be null.

The conference is clearly IRE since the tipsheet mentions it's from an IRE conference.

For the year, I don't see a specific year mentioned in the provided text, so I'll set it to "Not Listed".

The title should be concise. The main topic is investigating police shootings, so I'll go with "Investigating Police Shootings."

The description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet talks about creating databases, analyzing police shootings, and debunking common mantras. So the summary could be: "A guide on how to investigate police shootings by creating databases, analyzing trends, and challenging common narratives around police use of force."

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Relevant keywords are "police shootings," "investigative reporting," "use of force," "database analysis," and "law enforcement accountability."

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with these elements, ensuring each value is properly quoted and formatted.
