Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me start by understanding what each part of the query requires.

First, the ID is given as 5503, so that's straightforward. Next, the authors section should be a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. The user mentioned not to make up names and leave them null if none are provided. Looking at the text, I see mentions of @stevesuo and @zivabranstetter. Since these are Twitter handles without full names, I'll set their names as null but use their handles in the affiliations since they might represent their organizations.

The conference is clearly listed as "IRE" because the user's note specifies it. The year isn't provided, so I'll mark that as "Not Listed". 

For the title and description, I need to summarize the content. The tipsheet covers organizing investigations from day one, including timelines, document management, collaboration tools, and writing strategies. So a suitable title could be about organizing investigative projects effectively. The description should capture this essence in 1-2 sentences.

Keywords are next. I'll extract terms like "investigative reporting", "organization", "collaboration tools", "document management", and "writing strategies" as they encapsulate the main topics without including the conference or authors.

I need to ensure all keys and values are in English, enclosed in quotes, and properly structured as per JSON syntax. I'll avoid any markdown formatting since it's specified to only produce a JSON object.

Now, putting it all together, making sure each part aligns with the user's instructions.
