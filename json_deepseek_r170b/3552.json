Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, the id is given as 3552, so that's straightforward. 

Next, for authors, there's only one author mentioned: Jason Felch. His name is provided, along with his email and affiliation with the Los Angeles Times. So I'll structure this as a list with one object containing these details.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE 2011, so the conference key will be "IRE" and the year is 2011 since it's specified in the text.

The title of the tipsheet is "Downloading the Data on Teachers," which I'll use directly. 

For the description, I need a concise summary of the content. The session focuses on using teacher performance data, specifically value-added analysis. So I'll write a brief summary that captures this essence without getting too detailed.

Keywords should be no more than five and exclude the conference or authors. From the text, relevant terms are "teacher performance," "value-added analysis," "education reporting," "standardized testing," and "data journalism." These seem appropriate and within the limit.

I must ensure all values are in English, enclosed in quotes, and that the JSON structure is correctly formatted without any markdown. I'll double-check each key to make sure there are no missing or incorrectly filled entries.
