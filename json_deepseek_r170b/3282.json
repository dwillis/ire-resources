Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. The input provided is a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference in 2009. 

First, I'll identify the id as 3282 since that's specified. Next, for authors, I notice several names mentioned: Amy Davis, Stephen Stock, Jason Whitely, etc. Each should be an object with name, email, and affiliation. Since emails aren't provided, they'll be null. Affiliations are based on their news organizations like KPRC or CBS4 Miami.

The conference is clearly IRE, and the year is 2009. The title should reflect the content, so "Investigative Reporting Tips" seems appropriate. 

For the description, I need a concise summary of the tipsheet. It includes various investigative story ideas on consumer issues, government accountability, and public spending. That's about two sentences.

Keywords are next. I'll pick relevant terms like "consumer investigations," "government accountability," "public spending," "media tips," and "investigative journalism." These capture the essence without overlapping with conference or authors.

I need to ensure all keys are in quotes and values properly formatted. No markdown, just plain JSON structure. Let me double-check each part: id, authors array with correct structures, conference set to IRE, year as 2009, title accurate, description concise, keywords limited to five relevant terms.

Looks like everything is accounted for. Time to put it all together in the JSON format.
