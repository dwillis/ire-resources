Alright, let me tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference titled "Automate Social Media" presented by Doug Haddix. They want me to convert this into a specific JSON object with certain keys.

First, I need to identify the required fields: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 4819. For authors, it's a list of objects each containing name, email, and affiliation. Since only Doug Haddix is mentioned without any additional details like email or affiliation, I'll set his name and leave the others as null.

Next, the conference is clearly stated as "IRE". The year isn't specified in the text provided, so it should be "Not Listed". The title is straightforward: "Automate Social Media".

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet covers tools for automating social media tasks like content curation and scheduling, so the description should reflect that.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking through the content, relevant keywords include automation, social media management, content curation, Buffer, HootSuite, IFTTT, etc. But since it's limited to five, I'll pick the most significant ones: automation, social media management, content curation, Buffer, HootSuite.

I must ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, no made-up information should be added, so only include what's present in the text.
