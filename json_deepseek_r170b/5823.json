Alright, so I need to help create a JSON object from the provided tipsheet. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, looking at the user's query, they want a response that's only a JSON object based on an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet about housing data investigations. The input includes slides, various data sources, and author information.

The task specifies that the JSON should have keys like id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. Let me break down each part.

Starting with the `id`, it's given as 5823. That’s straightforward.

Next are the `authors`. The input lists four people: Lorie Hearn, Matt Clark, Aaron Terrazas, and Jon Schleuss. Each has an email and an affiliation. For example, Lorie Hearn is from inewsource, so her affiliation is clear. Similarly, Matt Clark is with Newsday, and so on. I need to structure each author as an object within the authors array.

The `conference` should be "IRE" since it's mentioned at the top of the tipsheet. 

For the `year`, there’s no specific year listed in the provided text, so it defaults to "Not Listed".

The `title` is clear: "Housing Investigations". It directly reflects the content.

The `description` needs a 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet talks about using data for housing investigations, covering property taxes, sales data, exemptions, etc. So I can condense that into a concise summary.

`Keywords` should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords are "property tax", "assessment rolls", "sales data", "ratio studies", and "exemptions".

I also need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. No markdown or additional text is allowed.

Let me make sure each part aligns with the instructions:

- `id`: 5823 (correct)
- `authors`: Each has name, email, affiliation. Affiliations are taken from their emails or mentioned organizations.
- `conference`: IRE
- `year`: Not Listed
- `title`: Accurate and specific
- `description`: Concise summary
- `keywords`: Five relevant terms

I think that covers all the requirements without missing any details. Now, putting it all together in JSON format as specified.
