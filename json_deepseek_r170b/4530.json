Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Joe Yerardi's presentation at the IRE 2015 conference in Philadelphia. Let me break this down step by step.

First, understanding what each part of the query requires:

- **id**: Given as 4530.
- **authors**: A list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. The tipsheet only mentions Joe Yerardi without an explicit email or affiliation. So his entry will have name: "Joe Yerardi", email: null, affiliation: "inewsource" since that's the news organization he's associated with.
- **conference**: Clearly stated as IRE 2015, so conference is "IRE".
- **year**: The year is 2015, as given in the text.
- **title**: The title of the tipsheet isn't explicitly mentioned, but from the content, it's about using Google Fusion Tables. So a suitable title would be "Using Google Fusion Tables".
- **description**: A concise summary. The tipsheet teaches journalists to create interactive maps with Fusion Tables without coding, so the description should reflect that.
- **keywords**: Up to five relevant terms. From the content, keywords could be "Google Fusion Tables", "Interactive Maps", "Journalism Tools", "Data Visualization", and "No Coding".

Now, I'll structure this information into a JSON object ensuring all keys are in quotes and values appropriately formatted.

I need to make sure that:
- The authors array only includes Joe Yerardi since he's the only one mentioned.
- Emails and affiliations are null where not provided, except for affiliation which is "inewsource" as it's the news org mentioned.
- The description is a brief summary in simple language.
- Keywords are relevant and within five.

Putting it all together, I'll draft the JSON object accordingly.

```json
{
  "id": 4530,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Joe Yerardi",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "inewsource"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2015,
  "title": "Using Google Fusion Tables",
  "description": "A guide on using Google Fusion Tables to create interactive maps for journalism without needing to code.",
  "keywords": [
    "Google Fusion Tables",
    "Interactive Maps",
    "Journalism Tools",
    "Data Visualization",
    "No Coding"
  ]
}
```
