Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given input. The user has provided some detailed information about CBC's investigative series on workplace safety.

First, looking at the id, it should be 2996 as specified. 

Next, for authors, the text mentions that the story was done by CBC News, but specific author names aren't listed. So, I'll set name to null and affiliation to "CBC News".

The conference isn't mentioned here, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed". The year is also not explicitly stated in the provided text, so year remains "Not Listed" too.

For the title, the series is called "Dying for a Job", which fits well. 

The description needs to be a concise summary. The series investigated workplace safety issues across Canada, highlighting problems like strain injuries and inadequate inspections. So, I'll phrase it to capture that essence in one or two sentences.

Keywords should include relevant terms without including the conference or authors. Workplace safety, occupational health, investigative journalism, freedom-of-information, and coroner reports seem appropriate.

Putting it all together, I structure each key with the required values, ensuring everything is enclosed in quotes and follows the specified format.
