Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's instructions. The input provided is about tips for investigative reporters covering weather disasters, authored by Jeremy Finley from WSMV-TV.

First, I'll start by identifying each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The id is given as 3526, so that's straightforward.

Next, the authors section. It looks like there's only one author mentioned, Jeremy Finley. His email and affiliation aren't provided in the text, but since he's affiliated with WSMV-TV, I'll include that. So, the authors array will have one object with name "Jeremy Finley", email null, and affiliation "WSMV-TV".

The conference isn't explicitly mentioned here. The user said it could be "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Since the tipsheet is from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference, I'll set conference to "IRE".

For the year, there's no specific date provided in the input, so I'll default to "Not Listed".

The title should be the name of the tipsheet, which seems to be "Investigating After Weather Disaster".

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The text covers preparation before disasters and investigations during and after. So, I'll write something like: "Tips for investigative reporters on preparing for and covering weather disasters, including pre-disaster research and post-disaster investigations."

Keywords should be up to five relevant terms. Looking at the content, appropriate keywords would be "disaster reporting", "investigative journalism", "weather emergencies", "emergency response", and "fundraising investigations".

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, making sure each key is properly quoted and values are correctly formatted.
