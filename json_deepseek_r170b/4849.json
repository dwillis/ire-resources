Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query and their specific instructions. The input provided is a detailed tipsheet from Margot Williams at an IRE conference in June 2016.

First, I'll identify each required key for the JSON object: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is given as 4849. 

Next, for the authors section, it's a list of elements with name, email, and affiliation. Margot Williams is listed with her email and affiliation to The Intercept, so I'll include that. There are no other authors mentioned.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, and the year is 2016 since it was held in June of that year. 

For the title, "Research Resources for Investigative Journalists" seems appropriate based on the content, which lists various tools and resources.

The description should be a concise summary. The tipsheet provides links to databases, FOIA resources, and other investigative tools, so I'll mention that it's a comprehensive collection of online databases and research tools useful for journalists.

Keywords need to be up to five terms. Looking at the content, "investigative journalism," "research tools," "FOIA resources," "online databases," and "journalism resources" are relevant.

I must ensure all values are in English and properly quoted. I'll structure everything accordingly without adding any made-up information.
