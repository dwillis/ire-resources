Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on this tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference about investigating agribusiness. Let me go through the requirements step by step.

First, the structure: id is given as 4755. That's straightforward. Next, authors are listed with name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the text, I see Peggy Lowe from Harvest Public Media, Nils Mulvad from Kaas & Mulvad, and Pam Dempsey from The Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting. Since emails aren't provided, they'll be null.

Conference is either IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed. Since it's about an IRE conference, that should be the value. Year isn't specified here, so it will be "Not Listed".

The title is clearly "Investigating Agribusiness". For description, a concise summary: It covers data and stories in agribusiness affecting various beats like labor, climate change, etc., highlighting challenges and opportunities.

Keywords should include up to five terms. From the content, important themes are 'agribusiness', 'investigative journalism', 'data journalism', 'environmental reporting', and 'government accountability'.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part accordingly without making up any information.
