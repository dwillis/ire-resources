Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has specified that the response should only include this JSON object, so I'll focus solely on that.

First, I'll identify each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. 

The id is given as 4651, so that's straightforward.

Next, for authors, there are four individuals mentioned: Sam Cohen, Lindsay Young, Derek Willis, and Matt Della Volpe. However, I notice that their affiliations aren't explicitly listed in the provided text. Since the user instructed not to make up names or affiliations, I'll set each author's name as null, along with email and affiliation. So each author object will have null for all attributes except where possible.

The conference is IRE because the tipsheet mentions "Investigative Reporters and Editors conferences."

The year isn't specified in the text, so according to instructions, it should be "Not Listed".

For the title, looking at the content, the main focus is on Election APIs, which is mentioned multiple times. So I'll use that as the title.

The description needs a concise summary. The tipsheet covers both FEC and AP Election APIs, explaining their functionalities and uses in campaign finance data and election results. So I'll write it to reflect that.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Relevant keywords from the content are: FEC API, AP Elections API, Campaign Finance, Election Results, API Usage.

Putting it all together, I structure each part accordingly, ensuring proper JSON formatting with everything in English and enclosed in quotes.
