Okay, so I'm trying to create a JSON object based on this tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given me specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, the ID is straightforward—it's T2696 as provided. Next, for authors, there's only one author mentioned: Tanya Eiserer from The Dallas Morning News. Since her email isn't listed, I'll leave that null. Her affiliation is clearly The Dallas Morning News, so that goes in.

The conference is obviously "IRE" because it's an IRE tipsheet. As for the year, looking at the text, there’s no specific year mentioned, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

The title of the panel is "Policing the police", which makes sense as the main topic. For the description, I need a concise summary in one or two sentences. The tipsheet talks about how the health of a police department relates to hiring practices and provides investigative steps. So I'll note that it's about evaluating police departments' health by examining hiring practices.

Keywords are next. I should pick up to five relevant terms. "Police accountability", "hiring practices", and "internal affairs" stand out as key areas covered in the tipsheet. Those three seem sufficient.

Putting it all together, each key is filled with the appropriate information, ensuring no made-up data and adhering strictly to what's provided.
