Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors conference. The user provided specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, let's parse the input. The main speaker is Maria Perez from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. She presented about developing sources on the beat. The tips include advice for new reporters, such as reaching out to predecessors, meeting in person, and building diverse sources. There are also specific points about the immigration beat, like knocking on doors and gaining community trust.

The id needs to be 5610. For authors, since Maria Perez is listed with her affiliation, I'll create an object with her name and affiliation. The conference isn't explicitly mentioned as IRE or NICAR, so it's "Not Listed." The year is also not provided, so that stays as "Not Listed."

The title should reflect the main topic, which seems to be about developing sources on a beat. The description needs to be a concise summary. I'll focus on strategies for building and maintaining sources in journalism.

Keywords are important here. They include things like source development, beat reporting, immigration, community engagement, and investigative journalism. These capture the essence without overlapping too much with the authors or conference names.

I should make sure all values are enclosed in quotes and that keys are correctly spelled. Also, since there's no email provided for Maria Perez, I'll leave that as null.

Double-checking everything to ensure it meets the user's specifications: correct structure, proper use of "Not Listed" where info is missing, accurate keywords, and a clear description.
