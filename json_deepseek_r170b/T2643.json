Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. The input provided includes details about Image Mapper from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet.

First, I'll identify the necessary keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is given as T2643, so that's straightforward.

Next, for the authors section, there's a list of people involved. Dave Sheingold is mentioned with his email and affiliation, The Record. Another author listed is Joe Lewis from Decision Support Services, Inc., but his email isn't provided. There's also a mention of a German company, Alta4, but no specific author name there, so I'll leave the name as null.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that goes into the conference key. The year isn't specified in the input, so it will be "Not Listed".

For the title, it's about Image Mapper facts and tips from the IRE conference. The description should summarize the content briefly. It includes how to get Image Mapper, its pros and cons, and usage tips.

Keywords need to be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. I'll choose "Image Mapper", "mapping software", "data visualization", "web maps", and "journalism tools".

Putting it all together, I structure each part into JSON format, ensuring proper syntax with quotation marks and commas.
