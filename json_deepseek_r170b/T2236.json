Alright, I need to figure out how to create this JSON object based on the user's query. Let me start by reading through their instructions carefully.

The user wants a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is given as T2236. For the authors section, each entry should have name, email, and affiliation. They emphasized not to make up names and leave them null if none are listed.

Looking at the input text provided, I don't see any author names mentioned. So, in the authors list, all names will be null. Emails and affiliations might also be null unless there's a news organization mentioned, but again, nothing is specified here.

Next, the conference key should be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". The input text refers to the Council of Better Business Bureaus and other regulatory bodies, which don't indicate a specific conference. So, I'll set it to "Not Listed".

The year isn't clearly mentioned anywhere in the provided text, so that will also be "Not Listed".

For the title, the text seems to discuss investigative research techniques for journalists. A suitable title could be something like "Investigative Research Techniques for Journalists."

The description needs to be a concise summary. The text talks about gathering information from public records, legal documents, and regulatory agencies. So, I'll phrase it as a 1-2 sentence summary highlighting these points.

Lastly, the keywords should include relevant terms without including conference or authors. From the text, appropriate keywords might be "investigative journalism," "public records," "FOIA requests," "regulatory research," and "legal documents."

Putting this all together, I'll structure each key accordingly, ensuring all values are in English as per the instructions.
