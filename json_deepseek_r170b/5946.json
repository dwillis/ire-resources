Okay, so I need to figure out how to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided specific instructions, so I should follow them carefully.

First, I'll start by identifying all the required keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 5946, so that's straightforward.

Next, for the authors, I need to list each speaker with their name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the text, there are five speakers mentioned: Felicia Harris, Manny Garcia, Jyoti Thottam, Matt Thompson, and Liz Roldan. Each has a Twitter handle, but no emails are provided, so those will be null. Their affiliations are listed next to their names, like "University of Houston-Downtown" for Felicia Harris, "USA TODAY Network" for Manny Garcia, etc.

The conference is clearly stated as #IRE19 Session, so the conference key should be "IRE". The year isn't explicitly mentioned beyond the hashtag, but IRE19 likely refers to 2019, so I'll use that for the year value.

The title of the session is "How to retain journalists from underrepresented groups", which is a direct quote from the text. For the description, it needs to be a concise summary in simple language. The tipsheet talks about supporting and retaining diverse journalists beyond just recruitment, focusing on mentorship, leadership, professional development, newsroom culture, etc.

Keywords should include relevant terms without including the conference or authors' names. From the content, appropriate keywords could be "diversity", "inclusion", "mentorship", "newsroom culture", and "leadership".

I need to structure all of this into a JSON object with each key properly quoted and values in English. Make sure that any missing information like emails is set to null, and affiliations are correctly assigned based on the text.

Finally, I'll double-check that all fields are included and formatted correctly according to the user's specifications.
