Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has specified several keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, the id is provided as 5988, so that's straightforward. 

Next, for the authors, I see three panelists mentioned: Ziva Branstetter from The Washington Post, Will Evans from Reveal, and Cheryl W. Thompson from NPR. Each of these should be an object in the authors array with name, email, and affiliation. Since emails aren't provided, they'll be null. Affiliations are clear from their titles, so I can use those.

The conference is IRE because it's sponsored by Bloomberg but controlled by IRE as mentioned at the beginning of the text. The year isn't explicitly stated in the input, so I'll set that to "Not Listed".

The title of the session is "Holding companies accountable". 

For the description, I need a concise summary. The session covers how to decide if a company's behavior is worth investigating, methods like FOIA requests, and ways to hold companies accountable through storytelling and impact.

Keywords should be relevant terms from the content: accountability, corporate investigations, FOIA, regulatory oversight, and investigative journalism. I'll limit it to five as instructed.

Putting it all together, each key needs to be in quotes with appropriate values. Authors are listed as an array of objects with their details. Description is a short summary, and keywords are a list without exceeding five terms.
