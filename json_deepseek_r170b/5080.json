Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. The input provided includes details from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. 

First, I'll identify the required keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The id is given as 5080. Next, for authors, there's only one author listedâ€”Andy Lehren from The New York Times. So, the authors list will have a single object with name "Andy Lehren", email null, and affiliation "The New York Times".

The conference is NICAR, which stands for National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting, so that goes under conference. The year is 2017 as mentioned in NICAR 2017.

The title of the tipsheet is "Investigating Bias and Influence in Criminal Justice". 

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet covers investigating bias and influence within the criminal justice system, emphasizing data analysis, sources, and storytelling. So the description will capture that essence in one or two sentences.

Keywords should be up to five relevant terms. From the content, "criminal justice", "bias", "data analysis", "investigative reporting" are key. That's four; I can add "storytelling" as it's mentioned too.

I'll structure all this into a JSON object ensuring proper syntax with quotes around keys and values. No markdown, just plain JSON.
