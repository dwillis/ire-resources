Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on this tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me start by understanding what's required.

First, the id is given as 3112. Thatâ€™s straightforward. Next, I have to extract the authors. Looking at the text, there are three names mentioned: Trish Wilson, James Neff, and Michael Sallah. Each has an email and affiliation. For each author, I need to create a JSON object with name, email, and affiliation.

Trish Wilson is from The Philadelphia Inquirer, her email is twilson@phillynews.com. James Neff is with The Seattle Times, email jneff@seattletimes.com. Michael Sallah is affiliated with The Miami Herald, his email is msallah@miamiherald.com. So I'll list all three in the authors array.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE" since it's an IRE Conference tip sheet. The year is June 7, 2008, so that goes into the year field. The title of the tipsheet is "Coaxing great writing from reporters."

For the description, I need a concise summary. It should mention how editors can help reporters improve their writing through early discussions, sharing examples, mixing story types, understanding each reporter's style, and using effective feedback techniques.

Keywords are next. They shouldn't include the conference or authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords could be "writing," "reporters," "editors," "investigative journalism," and "storytelling." That makes five terms, which fits the requirement.

Now, I need to ensure all keys are in English and properly quoted. The structure should have id, authors (as an array of objects), conference, year, title, description, and keywords. Each author object has name, email, affiliation.

Double-checking for any missing info: no names are null, so that's fine. Emails and affiliations are all present. Year is clearly 2008 from the date provided.

I think that covers everything. Now I'll structure it into a JSON object with all these elements included.
