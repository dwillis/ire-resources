Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has already given an example of how it should look, but I have to make sure I understand each part correctly.

First, looking at the input, the title is "Web for Investigations" presented by Doug Haddix. So the authors array will include his name, with email and affiliation as null since they aren't provided. The conference is clearly an IRE event. Since there's no specific year mentioned in the text, I'll set that to "Not Listed".

The description needs to be a concise summary. From the tipsheet, it covers various web tools for investigations, including Google search techniques, social media searches, and other resources. So I can summarize it as guidance on using web tools for investigative journalism.

For keywords, I need up to five terms that represent the main topics. The tipsheet mentions advanced Google search, Facebook, Twitter, deep web searches, and public records. Those will be my keywords.

I also have to make sure all keys are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. No markdown, just plain JSON with each key-value pair correctly formatted.
