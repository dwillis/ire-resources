Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an IRE conference. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, the id should be T2744 as specified. 

Next, looking at the authors section. There's Deborah Crowe listed with her emails and affiliation. So, I'll include her name, both email addresses, and her affiliation as Los Angeles Business Journal. Since there are no other authors mentioned, that's the only entry in the authors array.

For the conference details, it clearly states "IRE National Conference 2006 â€“ Fort Worth, Texas", so the conference is IRE, and the year is 2006. The title of the tipsheet is "Basics of Business Investigations: From Backgrounding to Ideas".

The description needs to be a concise summary. The main focus is on investigating public companies through tracking news and regulatory filings, so I'll mention that along with key sections like management discussions and legal proceedings.

Keywords should include relevant terms without repeating the conference or authors. I'll go with "business investigations", "public companies", "SEC filings", "financial statements", and "investigative journalism".

Now, putting it all together ensuring each key is correctly formatted and values are enclosed in quotes. Making sure not to add any extra information beyond what's provided.
