Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through this step by step.

First, I see that the user has given specific instructions for each part of the JSON structure: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The ID is fixed as 5117, so that's straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors section. The tipsheet mentions "For human disasters..." but doesn't list any specific authors or names. Since there are no names provided, I'll set each author entry to have null for name, email, and affiliation. This might mean having an empty array if no authors are listed, but since it's a tipsheet from IRE, maybe the organization is the author? Wait, the user said not to make up names, so I think it's safer to leave authors as null or an empty list.

The conference is mentioned as "IRE", so that's clear. The year isn't specified in the provided text, so according to instructions, I'll set it to "Not Listed".

For the title, the tipsheet covers how to use Twitter for reporting on human disasters, so a fitting title would be "Using Twitter for Reporting on Human Disasters".

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about using specific keywords and geolocation searches in Twitter, so I can summarize that as: "Tips on using Twitter search operators and geolocation tools to cover human disasters like explosions, shootings, etc."

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the text, relevant keywords are Twitter, human disasters, search operators, geolocation, and social media monitoring.

Putting it all together, I need to structure this into a JSON object with each key properly enclosed in quotes and values as per the instructions.

```json
{
  "id": 5117,
  "authors": [],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Using Twitter for Reporting on Human Disasters",
  "description": "Tips on using Twitter search operators and geolocation tools to cover human disasters like explosions, shootings, etc.",
  "keywords": ["Twitter", "human disasters", "search operators", "geolocation", "social media monitoring"]
}
```
