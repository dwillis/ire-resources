Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The user provided specific details from Eva Parks' presentation.

First, I'll identify each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 4482. 

For the authors section, there's only one author mentionedâ€”Eva Parks. Her email and affiliation are both present in the text. So, her entry will have name "Eva Parks", email "eva.parks@nbcuni.com", and affiliation "KXAS-TV NBC".

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that goes into the conference key. The year isn't provided in the input, so it'll be "Not Listed".

The title of the tipsheet is "Military Investigation Tipsheet". 

Next, the description should be a concise summary. The tipsheet focuses on military FOIA requests and other records, helping journalists investigate effectively.

For keywords, I'll pick relevant terms: "FOIA", "military records", "investigative reporting", "journalism resources", "government transparency".

I need to make sure all values are in English, enclosed in quotes, and the structure follows the JSON format correctly without any markdown.
