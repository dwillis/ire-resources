Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, looking at the input, there are two authors mentioned: Ziva Branstetter from Tulsa World and Phil Williams from News Channel 5. Their emails are also provided, so I can include those in their respective author objects within the JSON.

The tipsheet covers various investigative topics such as government records, non-profits, hospitals, schools, crime, corrections, courts, businesses, environment, and more. The description should be a concise summary of these areas, emphasizing how public records are used to uncover important stories.

I'll need to list relevant keywords without repeating the conference or authors. From the content, key topics include government records, non-profits, hospitals, FOIA, and investigative reporting techniques.

The conference is clearly identified as IRE, so that's set. The year isn't provided in the input, so it will be "Not Listed".

Putting it all together, the JSON should have an id of 4002, a list of authors with their details, the correct conference name, a brief description, and up to five keywords.

```json

  "id": 4002,

    },
    {
      "name": "Phil Williams",
      "email": "pwilliams@jrn.com",
      "affiliation": "News Channel 5"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigative Reporting Techniques and Public Records",
  "description": "A guide to using public records for investigative journalism, covering topics like government transparency, FOIA requests, and data analysis.",
  "keywords": [
