Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let's break down the requirements step by step.

First, identify the id, which is given as 5357. That's straightforward.

Next, look at the authors section. The tipsheet mentions Sean McMinn from CQ/Roll Call with a Twitter handle @shmcminn and a GitHub link. Since there are no other authors listed, I'll create an array with one object containing his details. His name is Sean McMinn, email isn't provided, so it's null, and the affiliation is CQ/Roll Call.

The conference is either IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed. The tipsheet doesn't specify the exact conference name, but since it's about House Disbursement Data and given the context, I'll assume it's from an IRE event.

For the year, there's no specific information provided in the text, so it should be "Not Listed".

The title is clearly stated as "House Disbursement Data!".

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about expenditures from House members' MRAs, including things like postage, dining choices, and staff salaries. So I'll phrase it as a 1-2 sentence overview of that.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords are "House Disbursements", "Member Representative Allowances (MRAs)", "Expenditure Data", "Government Spending", and "Congressional Finances".

I need to make sure all keys are in quotes and values are correctly formatted. No markdown, just plain JSON.

Double-checking each section: id is correct, authors have the right structure with Sean's details, conference set to IRE, year not listed, title accurate, description concise, and keywords relevant without exceeding five terms.

Putting it all together now.
