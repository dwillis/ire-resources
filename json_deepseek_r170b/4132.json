Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on this tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given me specific instructions about the structure, including id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, let's identify each component:

- **id**: It should be 4132 as specified.
  
- **authors**: This is a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. The input doesn't mention any authors by name, so the name field will be null. Email and affiliation can also be null since there's no information provided about them.

- **conference**: Since it's from IRE, the conference should be "IRE".

- **year**: The text doesn't specify the year of the event, so it'll be "Not Listed".

- **title**: Looking at the content, the main topic is campaign finance, specifically mentioning the McCutcheon decision. So a suitable title would be "Campaign Finance: News Tips".

- **description**: Needs to be 1-2 sentences summarizing the text in simple language. The tipsheet discusses how state laws might be affected by the McCutcheon ruling and provides resources for reporters.

- **keywords**: Up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Relevant keywords are "campaign finance", "McCutcheon decision", "state laws", "elections", and "disclosure practices".

Putting it all together, I structure each part as per the instructions.
