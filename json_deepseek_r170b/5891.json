Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has specified that the response should only be this JSON object without any additional text. 

First, let me parse the input. The tipsheet covers various strategies for managing time effectively in a daily newsroom while handling investigative projects. It includes advice from multiple editors at The Oregonian and other organizations.

Looking at the structure, each section has contributors with their affiliations. For example, Therese Bottomly is from The Oregonian, Mary Mooney as well, Grant Butler, Karly Imus, Amy Wang, and Shawn McIntosh from Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Since the user instructed not to make up names, I'll list these authors in an array.

Each author object should have name, email, and affiliation. Emails aren't provided, so they will be null. Affiliations are clear for most, except maybe some where it's just the organization without a specific role.

The id is given as 5891. The conference is IRE since that's mentioned in the text. Year isn't specified, so it'll be "Not Listed". 

For the title, something like "Time Management Strategies for Investigative Journalism" seems appropriate. The description should be concise, summarizing the tipsheet's purposeâ€”maybe about balancing daily tasks with long-term investigations.

Keywords need to be relevant and limited to five. I'll choose time management, investigative journalism, newsroom strategies, accountability reporting, and enterprise storytelling.

Now, putting it all together ensuring proper formatting without markdown.
