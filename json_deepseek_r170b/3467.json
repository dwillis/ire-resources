Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has specified that the response should only include this JSON object without any additional text or markdown.

First, I'll identify each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

- **id**: Given as 3467.
- **authors**: A list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. From the input, Peter Aldhous is listed with his email and affiliation as San Francisco Bureau Chief. Marc Smith and Ben Shneiderman are mentioned but without emails or affiliations beyond their names, so their emails will be null.
- **conference**: The tipsheet mentions it's from a CAR meeting in Raleigh on Feb 25, 2011. Since IRE conferences include CAR (Computer-Assisted Reporting), the conference is "IRE".
- **year**: Clearly stated as 2011.
- **title**: "NodeXL for Social Network Analysis".
- **description**: A brief summary. The tipsheet introduces NodeXL as a free Excel template for social network analysis, especially optimized for online media like Twitter, Flickr, and YouTube.
- **keywords**: Up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Relevant keywords are NodeXL, Social Network Analysis, Excel, CAR, and Twitter.

I need to structure all this into the JSON format with proper enclosures in double quotes. Each value should be in English as per instructions. Ensure that no extra information is added beyond what's specified.
