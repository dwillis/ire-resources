Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let's break down each part step by step.

First, the id is provided as 4982, so that's straightforward. Next, looking at the authors section, Sharad Goel is listed with an affiliation to Stanford University. There's no email provided, so I'll set that to null.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE". The year isn't mentioned in the text, so according to the instructions, it should be "Not Listed".

For the title, the main topic seems to be about algorithmic fairness, particularly focusing on tools like COMPAS. So I'll use "Algorithmic Fairness" as the title.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet discusses whether algorithms are fair and the complications involved, so I'll phrase it to reflect that examination of fairness in criminal justice algorithms.

Keywords should be relevant and limited to five. They include "algorithmic fairness", "criminal justice", "risk assessment", "bias", and "COMPAS".

Putting it all together, each key needs to be enclosed in quotes, and the structure must strictly follow JSON formatting without any markdown.

  "conference": "IRE",

  "description": "This tipsheet examines the fairness of algorithms like COMPAS in criminal justice, discussing issues like disparate impact and potential biases.",
