Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let's go through each part step by step.

First, the ID is provided as 6089, so that's straightforward.

Next, the authors section. The text mentions Adrian D. Garcia with his email and affiliation as The Financial Times/Money-Media. So I'll list him with those details. There are no other authors mentioned, so the array has only one entry.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE since it's from an IRE event.

Looking for the year: the bit.ly link provided doesn't include a date, and there's a filename with 20220303, which suggests March 3, 2022. So the year should be 2022.

The title of the session is "Excel 3: Filtering and Pivot Tables."

For the description, I need to summarize it in 1-2 sentences. The tipsheet focuses on using Excel filters and pivot tables for data analysis, so that's the essence.

Keywords are next. The main topics are Excel, filtering, pivot tables, data sorting, and Microsoft Excel. I'll list these, making sure not to exceed five terms.

Putting it all together now.
