Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has specified several keys that need to be included: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, I'll look at the input provided. It's a list of guiding principles for partnerships in investigative collaborations. The tipsheet doesn't mention any specific authors by name, so the authors array will have elements with null names, emails, and affiliations unless the text provides that info. In this case, there are no author details given, so each entry in the authors array will be {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": null}.

Next, I need to determine the conference. Since the tipsheet is from an IRE event, the conference key should be "IRE". The year isn't provided in the text, so it'll be "Not Listed".

The title seems clear: "A Top Ten List of Guiding Principles from the Trenches of Investigative Collaborations." That's a direct quote from the input.

For the description, I need to summarize the content in 1-2 sentences. The tipsheet talks about collaboration principles like remembering the mission, having champions on top, humility, clear roles, sharing information, starting small, and being patient. So, the description should capture that it's a guide for effective partnerships with key principles.

Keywords are next. They need to be up to five terms, excluding the conference name and authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords might include "collaboration," "partnerships," "investigative journalism," "reporting," and "media." These cover the main topics without overlapping with the other specified exclusions.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part accordingly. The id is 5695 as given. Since there are no specific authors mentioned, the authors array will have one element with nulls across the board. Conference is "IRE," year is "Not Listed." Title and description are set based on the summary above, and keywords are selected to represent the content accurately.

I need to ensure all values are in English unless specified otherwise, which they are here. Also, all keys must be enclosed in quotes, which I'll take care of when formatting the JSON.

Double-checking everything: id is correct, authors have no info so nulls, conference is IRE, year not listed, title captured properly, description concise, keywords relevant and within limit. Looks good!

```json
{
  "id": 5695,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "A Top Ten List of Guiding Principles from the Trenches of Investigative Collaborations",
  "description": "This tipsheet provides guiding principles for effective partnerships and collaborations in investigative journalism, emphasizing trust, communication, and shared goals.",
  "keywords": [
    "collaboration",
    "partnerships",
    "investigative journalism",
    "reporting",
    "media"
  ]
