Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me go through the requirements step by step.

First, the structure should have specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 5143. 

Looking at the input, Andy Lehren from The New York Times is listed as the speaker. Since only his name and affiliation are provided, I'll set his email to null. So, authors will be a list with one object containing name: "Andy Lehren", email: null, affiliation: "The New York Times".

The conference is clearly stated as IRE 2017 in Phoenix, AZ. Therefore, the conference key is "IRE" and the year is 2017.

The title of the tipsheet is "Investigating Bias and Influence in Criminal Justice". 

For the description, it should be a concise summary. The main points from the input include checking literature sources like Jstor, learning relevant math formulas, thinking outside the box with databases, and using data for storytelling. So, I'll craft a 1-2 sentence summary that captures these elements.

Keywords are up to five terms. From the content, "criminal justice", "bias", "data journalism", "investigative reporting", and "storytelling" seem appropriate.

I need to ensure all values are in English and enclosed in quotes. Also, since some details like email aren't provided, I'll set them to null where necessary.

Putting it all together, the JSON should accurately reflect the tipsheet's content as per the user's instructions.
