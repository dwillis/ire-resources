Okay, so I need to figure out how to create this JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors conference. The user has provided specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, I'll start by identifying the id, which is given as 4490. That's straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors section. There's Doug Pardue listed with his email and affiliation from The Post and Courier. So in the JSON, I need to create a list under "authors" with each author having name, email, and affiliation. Since there's only one author mentioned, that part is easy.

For the conference key, the user mentioned it should be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". The tipsheet is from an IRE conference, so I'll set that as the value.

The year isn't explicitly stated in the provided text. So according to the instructions, if it's not clearly identified, we use "Not Listed".

The title should be "TIPS FOR INVESTIGATING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE" based on the header given.

Now, the description needs to be a concise 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. The tipsheet provides strategies for journalists investigating domestic violence, emphasizing data collection and building databases. So I can write something like: "Tips for investigating domestic violence, including compiling data, building databases, and understanding cultural factors."

For keywords, they need to be no more than five terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords would be "domestic violence", "investigative journalism", "data collection", "cultural factors", and "databases". That covers the main topics without overlapping with conference or author names.

Putting it all together, I structure each key accordingly, ensuring that strings are in quotes and proper syntax is followed. Double-checking to make sure there's no made-up information and everything aligns with the user's instructions.
