Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. Let me start by understanding what they're asking for.

The user provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference about developing sources on the beat. They want this information converted into a specific JSON structure with keys like id, authors, conference, year, etc.

First, I'll look at the content to extract relevant details. The author mentioned is Maria Perez from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, with her contact info provided. There's no clear year in the text, so I'll set that as "Not Listed". The title seems obvious: "Developing Sources on the Beat".

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet offers strategies for building sources when new to a beat, including meeting people in person and using databases. I'll condense that into one or two sentences.

For keywords, I should include terms like "source development", "journalism techniques", etc., but exclude the conference name and author names. I'll list up to five relevant keywords.

I also need to structure the authors correctly. Maria's details are provided, so her entry will have name, email, and affiliation. There are no other authors mentioned, so that's straightforward.

Finally, putting it all together, ensuring each key is properly quoted and values follow the specified format.
