Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The user provided specific instructions and an example response.

First, I'll parse the input text to extract necessary information. The title is "Finding and Using the Data" for Toll Roads. The author is Paul Overberg from USA TODAY with his email and phone number provided. The conference is NICAR National in Newark, N.J., during March 9-12, 2006.

Next, I need to structure this into a JSON object with keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id should be T2656 as per the example. For authors, since there's only one author mentioned, Paul Overberg, his details are included. His affiliation is USA TODAY.

The description needs to be a concise summary of the text in simple language. I'll focus on how the tipsheet discusses using data from toll roads for investigative reporting, including financial and operational aspects.

Keywords should be relevant terms like "toll roads," "data journalism," etc., excluding conference or author names. I'll list up to five keywords.

I need to ensure all values are in English, keys are properly quoted, and the structure matches the example exactly without any markdown formatting.
