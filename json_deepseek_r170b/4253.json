Alright, so I need to help create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The user provided specific details from a conference session titled "Digging Deeper with Social Media" and wants this information structured into a JSON format.

First, I'll look at the structure they want: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. They specified that the id should be 4253. Next, for each author, I need to extract their name, email, and affiliation. The user mentioned names like Hena Cuevas from Univision (Los Angeles), Mekahlo Medina from KNBC-TV (LA), David Plazas from News-Press Media Group (FL), and Doug Haddix from Kiplinger Program/Ohio State.

I notice that the emails aren't provided, so each author's email will be null. The affiliations are clearly mentioned next to their names, so I'll use those accordingly. 

The conference is "IRE" as stated in the user's instruction. Since there's no year specified in the text, the year will default to "Not Listed". The title should match the session title, which is "Digging Deeper with Social Media".

For the description, I need a concise summary of what this session covers. From the content, it seems they discussed using social media tools for investigative journalism, including Facebook's Open Graph and Twitter's advanced search. So, I'll phrase that into one or two sentences.

Keywords should be relevant terms excluding the conference name and authors' names. Looking at the content, appropriate keywords might include "social media", "investigative journalism", "Facebook Open Graph", "Twitter search", and "journalist tools".

Putting it all together, each author will have their details listed under "authors" as an array of objects with name, email, and affiliation. All other keys like id, conference, etc., are filled in based on the provided information.

I should double-check that all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, ensure that no extra information is added beyond what's specified by the user.
