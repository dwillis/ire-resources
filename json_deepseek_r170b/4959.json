Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the ID is given as 4959, so that's straightforward. Next, looking at the authors section. The text mentions Maureen Linke from the Associated Press. Since there are no other authors listed, I'll set her name and affiliation but leave email null because it's not provided. Also, the user specified to use the news organization as the affiliation if none is explicitly mentioned, which fits here.

The conference is NICAR 17, so the year should be 2017 since NICAR conferences are annual and the 17 likely stands for 2017. For the title, "Practical Data Visualization in JavaScript" captures the main topic.

In the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet covers using jQuery for data visualization, including different chart types and examples. So, I'll write that it's about using JavaScript and jQuery libraries to create various charts like bar, pie, and tables.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Relevant ones here are "data visualization," "JavaScript," "jQuery," "charts," and "libraries." 

I need to make sure all keys and values are in English and enclosed in quotes. I won't include any made-up information; if something isn't provided, like email, it stays null.

Putting it all together, the JSON should accurately reflect each part of the tipsheet without adding extra details.
