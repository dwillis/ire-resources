Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query and the provided tipsheet content. Let me break down the steps.

First, the id should be 2847 as specified. Looking at the text, the author mentioned is David Herzog from NICAR and Missouri School of Journalism. So authors will have one entry with name "David Herzog" and affiliation set to both organizations since they're listed together.

The conference is NICAR since it's explicitly stated in the tipsheet. The year isn't provided, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

For the title, the main heading seems to be "ArcView grab bag", which makes sense as a comprehensive title for the tools covered. The description needs to be concise, summarizing that it covers various tools and techniques for spatial analysis in ArcView. 

Keywords should include terms like "ArcView", "GIS", "spatial analysis" since these are central themes. I'll limit them to five relevant terms.

I need to make sure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, no made-up names or emails—just the information provided.
