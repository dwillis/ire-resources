Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The input includes details about tracking sex offenders who have dropped off the radar, presented by Paul D’Ambrosio.

First, I'll identify the required keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The id is given as T2627. That's straightforward.

Next, for authors, there are two people mentioned: Paul D’Ambrosio and James W. Prado Roberts. Paul has an email (pmd@app.com) and affiliation with Asbury Park Press. James doesn't have an email listed, so that will be null, but his affiliation is also the Asbury Park Press as he's a staff writer there.

The conference is IRE since it's from their event.

Year isn't directly mentioned, so I'll set it to "Not Listed".

Title should capture the main topic: "Tracking sex offenders: How to find the ones who have dropped off the radar screen"

Description needs to be concise. I'll summarize that it discusses loopholes in Megan’s Law and methods to track missing offenders.

Keywords will include Megan's Law, sex offenders, notification programs, loopholes, tracking. I'll limit them to five relevant terms.

Now, structuring all this into a JSON object with proper syntax.
