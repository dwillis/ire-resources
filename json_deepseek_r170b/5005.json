Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conferences. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, I'll identify the key elements required: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The id is straightforward; it should be 5005 as specified.

Next, looking at the authors section. There are two presenters mentioned: Joel Engelhart and Jennifer Forsyth. Each author's name, email, and affiliation need to be extracted.

For Joel Engelhart:
- Name: Joel Engelhart
- Email: jengelhardt@pbpost.com
- Affiliation: The Palm Beach Post (since it's his employer)

For Jennifer Forsyth:
- Name: Jennifer Forsyth
- Email: jennifer.forsyth@wsj.com
- Affiliation: The Wall Street Journal

Now, the conference is mentioned as IRE, so that's set.

The year isn't explicitly provided in the text, so it will be "Not Listed".

The title of the session is "Editors: Bulletproofing Your Data Stories".

For the description, I need a concise 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet focuses on editors ensuring data accuracy by asking key questions and best practices for methodology verification.

Keywords should include terms like data stories, accuracy, methodology, best practices, and verification.

Putting it all together, each part is filled out correctly without missing any fields.
