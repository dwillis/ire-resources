Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. They provided a detailed tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference about handling data for breaking news investigations.

First, looking at the structure they want: id is 4038, authors are a list with name, email, and affiliation. The original text mentions speakers like Derek Willis, Jacob Harris, Aaron Bycoffe, and references organizations like WNYC and ProPublica. So, I'll note those as affiliations if their names aren't listed directly.

The conference is clearly IRE, so that's set. Since the year isn't mentioned in the tipsheet, it'll be "Not Listed". The title seems to be "This just in: Data for breaking news investigations". 

For the description, I need a concise summary. It should mention how the tipsheet helps anticipate data needs during breaking news, organize info, and present it internally and externally. 

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference and authors. So, "breaking news", "data journalism", "investigative reporting", "crisis preparation", and "emergency response" fit well.

Putting it all together, ensuring each key is properly quoted and values are correctly formatted. No made-up names, just using the ones mentioned in the text.
