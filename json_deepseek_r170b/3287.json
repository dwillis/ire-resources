Alright, I need to create a JSON object from the given input based on the user's instructions. Let me break down each step.

First, the id should be 3287 as specified. Next, authors is a list where each element has name, email, and affiliation. The input mentions several producers from Inside Edition like Matt Meagher and Charlie McLravy, but their emails aren't provided. I'll set their names and affiliation to "Inside Edition", leaving email as null.

The conference is either IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed. Since the text refers to IRE in the footer, I'll use "IRE" for the conference key.

For the year, it's not explicitly mentioned in the input, so I'll set it to "Not Listed".

The title isn't provided directly, but looking at the content, it seems to be about investigative story ideas, so I'll go with that as the title.

The description needs a concise summary. The text is a collection of consumer investigation stories and potential news leads, so I'll phrase it accordingly in simple terms.

Keywords should be up to five relevant terms. From the topics covered—consumer investigations, safety issues, Congressional junkets, product recalls, and elder scams—I'll extract those as keywords.

I need to ensure all keys are enclosed in quotes and values are in English unless specified otherwise. Also, I must avoid making up any information not present in the input.

Double-checking everything: id is correct, authors have their names and affiliations without emails, conference is properly set, year is accurate based on available data, title and description capture the essence, keywords are relevant, and JSON structure is maintained.

```json

  "id": 3287,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Inside Edition"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Consumer Investigations and Story Ideas",
  "description": "A collection of story ideas and investigative leads for consumer-related issues, including product safety, travel, and elder scams.",
  "keywords": [
    "consumer investigations",
    "product safety",
    "travel scams",
    "elder scams",
    "Congressional junkets"
  ]
}
```
