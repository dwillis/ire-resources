Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about the opioid epidemic tipsheet from The Palm Beach Post. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, the id is given as 5672, so that's straightforward. Next, authors: the text mentions Holly Baltz with her title and affiliation at The Palm Beach Post. There's no other author listed, so the list will have only one entry with her details. Since her email isn't provided, I'll leave it null.

For conference, the user mentioned it's from an IRE conference, but looking at the text, it doesn't specify which year or if it's NICAR or another event. So I'll set conference to "Not Listed" and year as well since the year isn't clear.

The title is directly from the input: "Places to find stories about people affected by the opioid epidemic". The description needs to be a concise summary, so I'll mention that it provides sources for reporters covering the epidemic, including families, medical examiners, etc., and how they can approach these sources.

Keywords should include relevant terms like opioid epidemic, families, medical examiner, EMS, social media, colleges, libraries, healthcare workers, police, schools. But I'm limited to five, so I'll pick the most impactful ones: opioid epidemic, families, medical examiner, EMS, healthcare workers.

Putting it all together, I structure each key accordingly, ensuring everything is in English and properly quoted. I double-check that all fields match the requirements without adding any made-up information.
