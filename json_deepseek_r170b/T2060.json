Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has provided specific instructions, so I should make sure each part is addressed correctly.

First, I'll look at the structure they want: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. Each of these needs to be properly formatted with the right data types.

The ID is given as T2060, straightforward. Next, the authors section requires a list of objects, each containing name, email, and affiliation. I need to extract this info from the provided text. 

Looking at the text, there are three people listed:
1. Stephen Kline with his email and affiliation WOAI-San Antonio.
2. Bryan Staples with his email and affiliation WTVF-Nashville.
3. Kristin Stinar with her email and affiliation KSTP-Minneapolis.

I should make sure each of these is correctly formatted in the JSON, including their names, emails, and affiliations as provided.

The conference is IRE since it's mentioned at the top of the tipsheet. The year isn't explicitly listed, so according to instructions, it should be "Not Listed".

For the title, the main heading seems to be about broadcast skills, specifically shooting and editing the story, so that will be the title.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet is about making CAR stories more engaging through various video techniques, so I'll condense that into 1-2 sentences focusing on visualization of data without relying on computers as the main element.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords would include "broadcast skills," "CAR stories," "video production," "investigative reporting," and "storytelling techniques."

I need to ensure all values are in English unless otherwise specified and that keys and string values are enclosed in quotes. Also, no made-up names; since all authors are provided with affiliations, I can fill those out without issues.

Putting it all together, I structure each part step by step, double-checking for any missing information or formatting errors to ensure the JSON is valid and meets the user's requirements.
