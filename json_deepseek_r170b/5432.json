Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, looking at the id: it's fixed as 5432. So that's straightforward.

Next, authors. There's only one author mentioned: Christopher Schnaars from USA TODAY. His email is cschnaars@usatoday.com and his Twitter handle is @chrisschnaars. Since the affiliation isn't explicitly stated next to his name but he's part of USA TODAY, I'll use that as his affiliation.

The conference is IRE because the tipsheet is from an IRE event. The year isn't provided in the text, so it will be "Not Listed".

For the title, the main heading is "COVERING COLLEGE ATHLETICS". That's clear and concise.

The description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet covers financial aspects of college athletics, including where to find documents, key revenue and expense categories, and tips for analyzing contracts. So I'll summarize that it provides guidance on investigating the finances of college sports programs.

Keywords should exclude conference and authors but include relevant terms from the content. Important terms are "college athletics", "financial documents", "FOIA requests", "coach contracts", and "revenue streams". That's five, which fits the limit.

Putting it all together in JSON format with proper quotation marks and structure.
