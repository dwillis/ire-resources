Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user specified several keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, the id is given as 5663, so that's straightforward. Next, I need to handle the authors section. The tipsheet lists Russ Buettner from The New York Times and Lisa Schwartz from The Wall Street Journal. Since their emails aren't provided, those fields will be null. Affiliations are clearly stated, so I can include them.

The conference is mentioned in the first line as IRE, so that's set. The year isn't explicitly listed anywhere in the text, so it should default to "Not Listed". 

For the title, the main heading is "Mining for Gold with Business Documents," which fits perfectly. Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers various business documents like state filings, UCCs, property records, and SEC docs. I'll phrase it to reflect that it's a guide on using these documents for investigative reporting.

Keywords are next. I should extract relevant terms without including the conference or authors. "Business documents," "investigative journalism," "UCC filings," "SEC filings," and "property records" seem appropriate, each encapsulating different sections covered in the tipsheet.

Putting it all together, ensuring that all fields are enclosed in quotes and correctly formatted as per JSON standards. I should double-check to make sure no made-up information is included and that all data accurately reflects what's provided.
