Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. The input provided is a tipsheet from Samantha Sunne at NICAR14. First, I'll extract the necessary information.

The id should be 4109 as specified. For authors, there's only one author mentioned: Samantha Sunne. Her email and affiliation aren't listed, so they'll be null. 

The conference is clearly NICAR, and the year is 2014. The title of the tipsheet is "Feel Like Youâ€™re Hacking, Step 1: Files on the web." 

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet teaches how to identify file paths and URLs, so I'll summarize that in one sentence.

For keywords, I need up to five relevant terms excluding conference and authors. The topics covered are file paths, URLs, data hacking, metadata, and CMS. That makes five, which is perfect.

Now, I'll structure all this into a JSON object with the specified keys and ensure proper formatting.

```json
{
  "id": 4109,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": 2014,
  "title": "Feel Like You\u2019re Hacking, Step 1: Files on the web",
  "description": "Learn how to identify and analyze file paths and URLs to understand data about data.",
  "keywords": [
    "file paths",
    "URLs",
    "data hacking",
    "metadata",
    "CMS"
  ]
}
```
