Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from the NICAR 2018 conference. The user has specified that each key should have specific attributes.

First, the id is given as 5362. That's straightforward.

Next, authors. The text doesn't list any names, so the name field will be null. Email and affiliation are also null since there's no information provided about them.

The conference is clearly stated as NICAR 2018, so I'll set that as "NICAR" and the year as 2018.

For the title, the original text has a section called "First steps" but the main heading is "THE ONLY ONE IN THE NEWSROOM | ​NICAR 2018". So I'll use that as the title.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet is about managing being the sole person handling data or coding in a newsroom, so I'll capture that in one or two sentences.

Keywords are next. Looking through the content, relevant terms include "investigative journalism", "newsroom resources", "professional development", "data journalism", and "journalist support". These cover the main topics without overlapping with the conference name or authors.

I should make sure all keys and values are in English and properly quoted. Also, no markdown is allowed in the JSON object.
