Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on the structure, so I'll start by breaking down each requirement.

First, the id is straightforward—5012 as specified. Next, the authors section requires a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the input, I see Ani Ucar (@AniUcar) and Rachel Schallom (@rschallom). Since their emails aren't provided, those fields will be null. The affiliation should be based on any mentioned news organizations, but in this case, it's not listed, so both authors' affiliations are also null.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE since the tipsheet mentions an IRE event. For the year, there’s no specific date given, so I'll set that to "Not Listed". The title of the tipsheet seems to be about making data approachable for younger audiences, which fits well.

Now, the description needs a concise summary. The tipsheet emphasizes that younger audiences value quality journalism and are engaged with injustices, relatable data, and clear presentation. So I'll craft a 1-2 sentence summary highlighting these points.

For keywords, I should extract relevant terms without including the conference or authors. Terms like "data visualization", "younger audiences", "quality journalism", "engagement", and "storytelling" seem appropriate, each capturing key aspects of the content.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, no markdown should be used in the final JSON output. I'll structure everything according to the specified keys, making sure not to include any additional information beyond what's provided.

Let me double-check each field: id is correct, authors have names with null emails and affiliations, conference is set right, year is not listed, title accurately reflects the content, description is concise, and keywords are relevant. Everything looks good.

    }
