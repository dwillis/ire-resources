Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. The user has provided a detailed tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference that took place on March 10, 2018. My task is to extract specific information and structure it into a JSON format with predefined keys.

First, I'll start by identifying each required key:

1. **id**: The user specified that the ID should be 5418.
2. **authors**: This should be a list of objects, each containing name, email, and affiliation. I need to extract these details from the participants listed in the tipsheet. Mago Torres is affiliated with JSK Fellow 2018, Forest Gregg with DataMade, and Donny Bridges with Center for Technology and Civic Life.
3. **conference**: The event was part of an IRE conference, so this key will be "IRE".
4. **year**: The year mentioned in the tipsheet is 2018.
5. **title**: A suitable title summarizing the session would be "Collaborations Across Newsrooms: Opportunities and Challenges."
6. **description**: This needs to be a concise summary of the session in one or two sentences. It should mention collaboration between newsrooms, key supports like purpose, trust, and process.
7. **keywords**: I'll extract relevant terms from the content, such as collaboration, coordination, communication, trust, and shared values.

I also need to ensure that all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. For emails, since only Donny Bridges' email is provided, others will be null. Affiliations should reflect the organizations mentioned next to each participant's name.

Now, I'll structure this information into a JSON object, making sure each key is correctly assigned and the data accurately reflects the tipsheet content.
