Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has specified that the response should only include this JSON object without any additional text or explanation.

First, I'll look at the structure they want. They mentioned keys like id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. Each key has specific instructions on how to populate it.

Starting with the id: It's given as T1768, so that's straightforward.

Next is authors, which should be a list of objects each containing name, email, and affiliation. In the provided tipsheet, Sarah Kendzior is listed as an author, but there’s no explicit mention of her email or affiliation beyond being part of The Guardian. Wait, actually looking back, in the original text, it says "Sarah Kendzior (The Guardian)". So her affiliation is clear. There's another author mentioned without a name, just an email: "<kelly@...". Since the name isn't provided, I should set the name to null, and use the email as given. Affiliation here isn’t specified, so it remains null.

Conference is either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". The tipsheet mentions NICAR, so that's clear.

Year: The original input doesn't specify a year, but looking back at the user's example response, they put 2015. Wait, in my earlier thought process, I considered the year as 2018 because the example had 2018, but actually, in this case, perhaps it was a typo or mistake. Let me check: The original text doesn’t have a clear year, so according to instructions, if not clearly identified, use "Not Listed". But in my initial response, I mistakenly put 2018 without basis. So I need to correct that.

Title is given as "Social Network Analysis".

Description needs to be a concise summary. From the tipsheet, it's about using social network analysis for investigative journalism, so I'll phrase it accordingly.

Keywords should be up to five terms. The main topics are Social Network Analysis, Investigative Journalism, Data Visualization, Entity Mapping, and Network Theory.

Putting it all together, ensuring that values are in English and properly quoted.
