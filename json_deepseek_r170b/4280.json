Alright, so I need to help this user by creating a JSON object based on their provided query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) tipsheet. Let me start by understanding the task.

First, the user wants a response that's only a JSON object. They've given a specific structure with keys like id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is fixed at 4280. 

Looking at the content provided, it's from Manny Garcia of Naples Daily News. I need to extract his details for the authors section. His name is Manny Garcia, and he's affiliated with Naples Daily News. There's an email mentioned as @manny_garcia1 on Twitter, so I'll include that.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE since it's part of their conferences. The year isn't provided in the text, so I'll set it to "Not Listed". 

For the title, the main heading seems to be about finding and cultivating sources under "Human Capital," so the title should reflect that.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about leveraging social media, schmoozing, building knowledge through public records, and more. So I'll summarize that into one or two sentences focusing on strategies for developing sources.

Keywords are next. They want up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords could be "sources," "journalism," "investigative reporting," "public records," and "social media."

I should make sure all keys and values are in English with proper quotemarks. I'll structure each part step by step, ensuring no made-up names and handling any missing info appropriately.

Finally, I need to format everything into a JSON object without any markdown, just plain text as per the user's instruction.
