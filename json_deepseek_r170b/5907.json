Alright, so I'm trying to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given me specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, I'll start by assigning the id as 5907 because that's what the user specified. Next, I need to identify the authors. Looking at the text, there are three panelists mentioned: Lorie Hearn from inewsource, Shawn McIntosh from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, and Charles Ornstein from ProPublica. Their affiliations are clear next to their names, so I'll list each author with their name and affiliation. Since no emails are provided for them, those fields will be null.

The conference is mentioned as part of the tipsheet's context, so I can confidently set the conference key to "IRE". The year isn't explicitly stated in the text, so according to the instructions, it should default to "Not Listed".

For the title, the panel's name is clearly "Transparency in Investigative Journalism" with the three authors listed. The description needs to be a concise 1-2 sentence summary. I'll focus on the main points: building trust through transparency practices like annotating stories and publishing documents, and addressing challenges like timing and responding to concerns.

Keywords are next. They should be no more than five terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, "transparency", "investigative journalism", "trust-building", "credibility", and "accountability" seem appropriate.

I need to ensure all keys and values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, since some fields like email aren't provided, they should be null. I'll structure the JSON accordingly, making sure it's valid and follows the user's specifications.
