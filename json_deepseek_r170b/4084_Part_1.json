Alright, I need to create a JSON object from the given tipsheet provided by Maud Beelman of The Dallas Morning News at an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. 

First, I'll identify each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The id is straightforward as 4084_Part_1.

Next, the authors section. Maud Beelman is listed with her affiliation as The Dallas Morning News. Since there's no email provided, that field will be null.

For the conference, since it's from IRE, that's clear. The year isn't mentioned in the text, so I'll set it to "Not Listed".

The title of the tipsheet seems to be about editing data projects, so I'll use "Editing the Data Project" as the title.

The description should be a concise summary. It focuses on helping editors work with data without prior experience and provides practical advice for managing data projects.

Keywords are limited to five terms. The main topics covered are data reporting, journalism, project management, investigative reporting, and editing.

Putting it all together, I structure each key appropriately, ensuring correct formatting and enclosing strings in quotes.
