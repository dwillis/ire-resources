Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's instructions. Let me go through this step by step.

First, the id is given as 4018, so that part is straightforward.

Looking at the authors, I see Barbara Gray from CUNY J-School and Timothy Sandler from NBC mentioned in the text. The user wants each author to have name, email, and affiliation. Since emails aren't provided for either, those will be null. Affiliations are clear: CUNY J-School and NBC.

The conference is listed as IRE, so that's set. The year is January 2014, so the year is 2014.

For the title, the main focus seems to be on finding data for investigative reporters, so I'll go with "Finding Data for Investigative Reporters."

The description needs to be a concise summary. It mentions various tools like Quandl and Knoema, so I'll highlight that it's about using search engines and resources to find public records and social media info.

Keywords should be no more than five terms. I'll pick data journalism, investigative reporting, CRS reports, social media research, and geolocation tools.

Putting it all together, the JSON structure is clear with each key properly filled.
