Alright, so I'm trying to create a JSON object from the given input based on the user's instructions. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the user provided a chunk of text that seems to be notes or a discussion about investigative reporting tactics, specifically dealing with confrontational sources. There are sections with questions and answers from different contributors, each giving their insights. The names mentioned are Eric Eyre, David Dehlman, Mike McIntire, and Sarah Kendzior, but I notice that in the text, some authors have affiliations listed next to their names.

The task is to structure this into a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 5862, so that's straightforward.

For the authors array, each entry needs name, email, and affiliation. The user instructed not to make up names, so if a name isn't listed, we leave it as null. Email and affiliation can be null too. However, if the text includes a news organization next to an author's name, that should be used as their affiliation.

Looking at the input, I see Eric Eyre is from the Charleston Gazette-Mail, David Dehlman from ProPublica, Mike McIntire from The New York Times, and Sarah Kendzior as an investigative journalist without an explicit affiliation mentioned. So I can assign affiliations accordingly, leaving Sarah's as null or maybe noting her as an independent journalist if that's acceptable.

Next is the conference key. The user mentioned it should be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Since the text doesn't specify which conference this is from, I'll set it to "Not Listed".

The year is also "Not Listed" because there's no clear indication of when the event took place.

For the title, since the original text doesn't have a specific title mentioned, I'll create one that reflects the content. Something like "Tactics for Dealing with Confrontational Sources in Investigative Reporting" seems appropriate.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The text discusses strategies reporters use when dealing with uncooperative or hostile sources during investigations, so summarizing that into one or two sentences will suffice.

Keywords should be up to five terms, excluding the conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords might include "investigative journalism", "reporting tactics", "confrontational sources", "journalist safety", and "media ethics".

Now, putting it all together in JSON format with proper syntax and ensuring all keys are enclosed in quotes.
