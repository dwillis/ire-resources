Okay, I need to create a JSON object from the given tipsheet. Let me break down what's needed.

First, the id is 3403 as specified. The authors section should have each author with name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the input, David B. Smallman is listed along with his email and affiliation, so he'll be the only author in the list. His name isn't null since it's provided.

Next, the conference is IRE because that's explicitly mentioned in the tipsheet title. The year is 2010, clearly stated in the event details. 

The title should capture the main topic, which seems to be about FOIA and Open Records Law developments, so "Latest Developments in FOIA and Open Records Law" fits.

For the description, it needs a concise summary of the content. The tipsheet talks about handling responses from agencies when they deny record requests, and how to seek discovery. So I'll summarize that into one or two sentences.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the text, FOIA, Open Records Law, Discovery, Government Transparency, and Legal Strategy seem relevant. 

I should ensure all keys and values are in quotes and structure everything correctly without making up any information. Double-checking for any missing data or formatting issues is important.
