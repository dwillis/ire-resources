Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with certain keys.

First, looking at the input, it's clear that the conference is about environmental investigations in the West, held in Denver in 2005. So, the 'conference' key should be "IRE" because it's an IRE event, and the 'year' is 2005.

Next, the title of the tipsheet seems to be "The environment beat in the West: An embarrassment of riches." That captures the main theme discussed.

For the authors, there are several names mentioned like Theo Stein, Shaun Stanley, Hyoung Chang, Chuck Bigger, and Helen Richardson. However, only Theo Stein is explicitly listed as an Environment Writer for the Denver Post. The others don't have affiliations or emails provided, so their entries in the authors list will have nulls except for their names.

The description should be a concise summary. I'll note that it covers issues like drought, wildfire, energy, and endangered species, emphasizing local impacts of national environmental policies.

Keywords need to be up to five terms. The main ones are drought, wildfire, energy, and endangered species. Also, since the focus is on the Western region, adding "Western U.S." makes sense as a keyword.

I should structure all this into a JSON object with the specified keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. Ensuring that each value is correctly formatted, especially the authors array with their respective details or nulls where information isn't available.
