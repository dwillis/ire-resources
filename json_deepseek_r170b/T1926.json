Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conferences. Let me go through each requirement step by step.

First, the structure should have specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as T1926, so that's straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors. The input mentions Charles D. Tobin from Holland & Knight LLP. His email and phone are provided, but since the JSON only needs name, email, and affiliation, I can extract those. So his entry in the authors list will have his name, email, and affiliation as "Holland & Knight LLP".

The conference is specified as IRE because it's from an IRE event.

For the year, the input doesn't mention a specific year, so I'll set it to "Not Listed".

The title of the tipsheet is given as "Deals with Cops May Be More Than You Bargained For". That should be used directly.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The main point is about legal implications when journalists collaborate with police. So I can write something like: "Explains the legal risks for journalists collaborating with law enforcement during operations."

Keywords are next. I need up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords could be "journalists", "law enforcement", "legal risks", "privacy rights", and "state actor". These capture the essence without overlapping.

Putting it all together, each field is filled appropriately based on the provided information. Ensuring no made-up data and only using what's given.
