Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The user provided specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, I'll note that the id is given as 5872, so I'll set that accordingly. Next, looking at the authors, Mike Soraghan and Holly Hacker are listed with their affiliations, E&E News and The Dallas Morning News respectively. Their emails aren't provided, so I'll leave those as null.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE 2019, so the conference key will be "IRE" and the year will be 2019. For the title, the main heading in the tipsheet is about pipeline records and data, so I'll use that.

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet provides resources for finding pipeline information, incidents, enforcement actions, etc. So, summarizing it as a guide to accessing these resources makes sense.

Keywords should exclude conference and authors but include relevant terms from the content. Pipeline records, PHMSA, pipeline safety, enforcement data, and National Pipeline Mapping System seem appropriate and within the five-term limit.

I'll structure all of this into a JSON object with proper formatting, ensuring that each key is enclosed in quotes as specified.
