Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conferences. Let me go through the requirements step by step.

First, the id should be "dodgingdisasters" as specified. 

Next, looking at the authors section: The input mentions Liz Lucas with her affiliation as IRE/NICAR. Since there's only one author listed, the authors array will have one object. Her name is provided, but email and affiliation details aren't given, so those will be null.

The conference field needs to be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Here, it's clearly an IRE/NICAR event, so I'll use both in the authors' affiliations but for the conference key itself, I think it should just be one. Wait, looking back at the example response, they put "conference": "IRE". That makes sense since it's an IRE tipsheet.

Year isn't mentioned anywhere in the input, so it will default to "Not Listed".

For the title, it's "Dodging Disasters" as given.

The description should be a concise summary. The main points are about being careful during data analysis, avoiding assumptions, and best practices. So I'll craft a 1-2 sentence summary that captures this essence.

Keywords need to be up to five terms excluding conference names or authors. From the content, relevant keywords could be "data analysis", "methodology", "assumptions", "trends", and "verification".

Putting it all together, each key must be in English with proper quotemarks, no markdown, just plain JSON.

  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Liz Lucas",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "IRE/NICAR"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Dodging Disasters",
  "description": "Tips for careful data analysis, avoiding common pitfalls and ensuring accuracy in investigative reporting.",
  "keywords": [
    "data analysis",
    "methodology",
    "assumptions",
    "trends",
    "verification"
