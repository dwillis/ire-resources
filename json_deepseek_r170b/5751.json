Alright, so I need to help this user clean their data using regex and then create a JSON object with specific fields. They provided a detailed query about data cleaning and substitution, but the second part is about creating a JSON from some input.

First, I notice that the user's main goal is twofold: data cleaning and JSON creation. The initial part talks about using regex101 to clean data into six groups, which they then substitute with tabs for Excel. But the latter part shifts focus to creating a JSON object with certain keys like id, authors, conference, etc.

I should probably address both parts. For the first part, they seem to have already gone through the process of setting up the regex and substitution in regex101. Maybe they just need confirmation or further assistance on that step. However, since their query ends with a command for a JSON object, I think their main request is about parsing some input into this specific JSON structure.

Looking at the JSON requirements: id is fixed as 5751. Authors are a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. They should not make up names; leave null if none. Email and affiliation can be null too. If the text mentions a news organization, use that as affiliation. The description needs to be a concise summary. Conference must be one of IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed. Year is specific, otherwise Not Listed. Keywords are up to five terms, excluding conference and authors.

I need to figure out what input they have. Since it's not provided, maybe I should ask for the input text to parse. Without that, I can't create the JSON accurately. Also, since they mentioned using a text editor with regex, perhaps they have a specific format or structure in mind that needs parsing into these fields.

I'll outline the steps: first, process the input text to extract relevant info, then map it to the JSON structure. For each author, I need to check if there's a name, email, and affiliation. If not, set them as null. The conference, year, and keywords will depend on the content.

I think they might be working with data from an academic paper or conference submission, given the fields like authors, conference, etc. So, extracting affiliations correctly is crucial, especially if it's a news organization.

In summary, to help them effectively, I need more details about the input text they're working with. Once I have that, I can guide them on how to extract each piece of information using regex or other methods and structure it into the required JSON format.

To create the desired JSON object from your input, you will first need to process the input text and extract the relevant information. Since you haven't provided the specific input text to work with, I'll guide you through the general steps to achieve this:

1. **Extract Relevant Information**: Use regex or other parsing methods to extract the following details:
   - `id`: Set as "5751".
   - `authors`: Extract names, emails, and affiliations of authors. If no name is listed, set `name` to `null`. If email or affiliation are not provided, set them to `null`.
   - `conference`: Identify if the conference is "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed".
   - `year`: Extract the year of the event. If not clearly identified, set to "Not Listed".
   - `title`: Extract the title of the paper or submission.
   - `description`: Write a 1-2 sentence summary of the text in simple language.
   - `keywords`: Extract up to five relevant keywords, excluding terms like the conference name and authors.

2. **Structure the JSON Object**: Once you have extracted all the necessary information, structure it into the JSON format as specified.

Hereâ€™s an example of what the JSON object might look like based on your requirements:

```json
{
  "id": "5751",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Author Name",
      "email": "author@example.com",
      "affiliation": "Affiliation Name"
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2023",
  "title": "Title of the Paper or Submission",
  "description": "A brief summary of the paper in simple language.",
  "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword3"]
}
```

If you provide the specific input text, I can help you further by guiding you on how to extract and structure the data accordingly.
