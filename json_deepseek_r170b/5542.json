Alright, I need to help the user create a JSON object based on their query. They've provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference titled "Digital Sleuthing on Deadline." 

First, I'll extract the necessary information step by step.

The id is given as 5542. 

Next, looking for authors: The document mentions DeniseMalan with the email training@ire.org and affiliation @IRE_NICAR. Since her full name isn't provided, I'll list her as "Denise Malan" assuming that's her full name. Another author is mentioned but only by the handle @IRE_NICAR without a name, so their details will be null except for affiliation.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE", and since it's an annual event, the year isn't specified, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

The title of the tipsheet is "Digital Sleuthing on Deadline."

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet covers strategies for effective online research, including search techniques, source verification, and tools for background checks.

Keywords should be up to five terms: digital sleuthing, investigative reporting, online research, journalism tools, source verification.

Putting it all together in JSON format as per the instructions.
