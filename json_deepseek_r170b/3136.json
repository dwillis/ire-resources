Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet titled "Navigating the Social Network Minefield." Let me break down the requirements step by step.

First, the structure of the JSON is specified with keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 3136. 

Next, I need to extract the authors. Looking at the input, there are several names mentioned like Andy Siegel-CBS VP Asst. General Counsel, Rick Yarborough, Stephen Stock, and Graeme Newell. Each author should have name, email, and affiliation. For emails, some are provided in the text, so I'll include those where available. Affiliations are based on their titles or mentions of news organizations like CBS.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE since it's part of the tipsheet context. The year isn't directly mentioned, so I'll set it to "Not Listed."

For the title, it's straightforward: "Navigating the Social Network Minefield." 

The description needs a concise summary. The tipsheet focuses on using social media for journalism, highlighting verification and legal issues, so I'll phrase that into a 1-2 sentence summary.

Keywords should be up to five relevant terms. From the content, key topics are social media, verification, copyright, privacy, and online sourcing.

Putting it all together, I structure each section ensuring correct syntax and proper use of quotes. I also make sure emails and affiliations are correctly matched to their respective authors.
