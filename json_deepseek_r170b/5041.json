Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given input about Google Trends from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each requirement step by step.

First, the id is specified as 5041. So that's straightforward.

Next, authors: The text doesn't mention any specific names, so I'll set "name" to null for each author entry. Email and affiliation can also be null since there's no information provided about them.

Conference: It’s an IRE conference, so the value is "IRE".

Year: The input doesn’t specify a year, so it will be "Not Listed".

Title: The title of the tipsheet is "Google Trends: Understanding the Data".

Description: I need to summarize the text in 1-2 sentences. Google Trends helps journalists track search data for story ideas and provides real-time insights into public interest.

Keywords: Extracting up to five relevant terms. From the content, the main keywords are "Google Trends", "data journalism", "search data", "story ideas", and "public interest".

Putting it all together, I ensure that each key is enclosed in quotes and that the JSON structure is correct.

  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Google Trends: Understanding the Data",
  "description": "Learn how to use Google Trends for story ideas and data in journalism, including its features and how to analyze search trends.",
  "keywords": [
    "Google Trends",
    "data journalism",
    "search data",
    "story ideas",
    "public interest"
