Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. Let me start by reading through the provided tipsheet content carefully.

First, the title of the presentation is "Everything I Wasted Time Worrying About as a Newbie Coder." The conference mentioned is NICAR 2017, so the year should be 2017. Kate Rabinowitz is the author, and her Twitter handle is @datalensdc. Since there's no email or affiliation provided, those will be null.

Next, I need to write a brief description. It should summarize the main points in simple terms. The presentation talks about common worries new coders have, emphasizes that coding relies on logic, mentions the importance of teamwork, and highlights that mistakes are part of the learning process.

For keywords, I'll extract relevant terms without including the conference or authors. The tipsheet covers newbie coders, coding challenges, problem-solving, collaboration, and debugging. These seem appropriate as keywords, each encapsulating a key aspect discussed.

I also need to ensure all keys are in English and enclosed in quotes. Since there's no made-up information, everything should be accurate based on the provided content.

Finally, I'll structure this into a JSON object with the specified keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The ID is given as 5063. Authors are listed with Kate Rabinowitz and her details. Conference is NICAR, year is 2017, and the rest follow accordingly.

Let me make sure everything fits the requirements and that I haven't missed any important details from the tipsheet.
