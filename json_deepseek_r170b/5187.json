Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about collaborative journalism. Let me break down the steps.

First, the ID should be 5187 as specified. The authors section needs each author's name, email, and affiliation. From the input, Arun Karki is listed with CDJN, so I'll include that. There's no other author mentioned, so that's it for authors.

Next, the conference isn't explicitly stated but since the user mentioned IRE conferences in their initial instruction, I'll go with "IRE". The year isn't provided, so it remains "Not Listed".

For the title, the slide mentions "how to collaborate and not hate each other", which seems appropriate. 

The description should be a concise summary. The key points are comparing lone wolf vs. networked models, emphasizing collaboration's benefits like global impact and shared ownership. So I'll phrase that into a couple of sentences.

Keywords need to be up to five terms. Collaborative journalism is central. Other relevant terms from the content are teamwork, trust, communication, and security. Those cover the main aspects discussed.

I should ensure all keys and values are in English with proper quotation marks. No markdown, just plain JSON. Let me structure it accordingly without any extra text.

```json

    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "How to Collaborate and Not Hate Each Other",
  "description": "This tipsheet discusses the importance of collaboration in journalism, comparing lone wolf and networked models, and provides strategies for managing team conflicts.",
  "keywords": [
    "collaborative journalism",
    "teamwork",
    "trust",
    "communication",
