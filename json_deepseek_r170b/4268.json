Alright, so I need to create a JSON object from this input about an IRE Workshop titled "Watchdogging Public Finance" held in Buffalo, NY in October 2014. The speaker is John W. Schoen, who works at CNBC and NBCNews.com, and he's also an adjunct professor at Columbia School of Journalism.

First, the structure needs to have specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 4268. 

For authors, I need a list where each entry has name, email, and affiliation. John's name is provided, his email is johnschoen@gmail.com, and since he works for CNBC/NBCNews, that will be his affiliation.

The conference is IRE, so that goes under the conference key. The year is clearly 2014, as stated in the input.

The title of the workshop is "Watchdogging Public Finance". 

Now, the description should be a concise summary in 1-2 sentences. Looking at the content, it's about investigating state and local financial issues, so I'll mention that and include key areas like budgets, audits, pensions, and bond markets.

Keywords need to be up to five relevant terms excluding conference and authors. So, I'll pick public finance, government accountability, pensions, municipal bonds, and budget analysis.

I should ensure all values are in English and properly quoted. No markdown or additional text outside the JSON structure.
