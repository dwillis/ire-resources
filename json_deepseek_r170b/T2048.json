Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about campaign finance resources from an IRE conference. Let me break down each part of their request.

First, the user provided a detailed list of sources divided into government/non-profit and for-profit categories. The main author mentioned is Ken McCall from the Dayton Daily News. Thereâ€™s no email or additional authors listed, so I'll set those to null where necessary.

The id must be "T2048". The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's straightforward. Since there's no specific year mentioned in the text, I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

For the description, I need a concise summary. It should mention that this tipsheet provides resources for campaign finance data from both government and non-profit sources.

Keywords are next. They shouldn't include the conference or authors. Looking at the content, terms like "campaign finance", "resources", "data", "government sources", and "non-profit organizations" fit well and are within the five-term limit.

I need to structure all this into a JSON object with specified keys: id, authors (as an array of objects), conference, year, title, description, keywords. Each value must be in English and enclosed in quotes.

Let me double-check everything. Authors only have Ken McCall with his affiliation. The description is clear and within two sentences. Keywords are relevant and not exceeding five. Conference is IRE, year is Not Listed since it's not provided.

Alright, putting it all together now.
