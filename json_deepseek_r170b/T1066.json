Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. Let me read through their instructions carefully.

First, they want an object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The ID should be T1066. Got it. 

Looking at the input text provided by the user, I see that there's a section at the end with Mike McGraw's contact information. His name is listed along with his email, affiliation (The Kansas City Star), and phone number. So, for the authors array, I should include him as the only author since he's the one providing the tip sheet.

Next, the conference key needs to be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". The input text mentions it's from a tip sheet presented at an IRE event because Mike McGraw is associated with IRE conferences. So, conference will be "IRE".

The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the provided text. I don't see any dates related to when this was presented or published, so year should be "Not Listed".

For the title, it's given as "Investigating College Athletics". That's clear and concise.

Now, the description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary. The tip sheet covers various ways to investigate college sports, including financial records, gender equity, criminal behavior, and conflicts of interest. So I'll summarize that into two sentences.

Keywords are up to five terms. From the text, relevant keywords would include "college athletics", "investigative reporting", "financial records", "gender equity", and "criminal behavior". These capture the main areas covered.

I should structure all this information into a JSON object with proper syntax, ensuring that each key is enclosed in quotes and the authors array includes Mike McGraw's details correctly. Also, since the user specified not to make up any names or emails if they aren't present, I only include what's provided.

Putting it all together, I'll form the JSON object as per the instructions, making sure everything aligns with their specifications.

```json

  "id": "T1066",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigating College Athletics",
  "description": "A tip sheet providing guidance on investigating college athletics, covering topics such as financial records, gender equity, criminal behavior, and conflicts of interest.",
  "keywords": [
    "college athletics",
    "investigative reporting",
    "financial records",
    "gender equity",
    "criminal behavior"
  ]
}
```
