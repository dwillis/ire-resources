Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors conference. Let me start by understanding what each part of the input contains.

First, the title is "Humanizing the heroin crisis" presented by Pat Beall from The Palm Beach Post. Her email is pbeall@pbpost.com. So under authors, I should list her with her name, email, and affiliation as The Palm Beach Post.

Next, I need to determine the conference. Since it's about investigative reporters, I think it's safe to assume it's an IRE conference unless stated otherwise. Thereâ€™s no year mentioned in the text, so the year will be "Not Listed".

The description should summarize the tipsheet in 1-2 sentences. The main points are about using various sources like Accurint, social media, police reports, and public records to tell the stories of those affected by the heroin crisis. So I'll craft a concise summary capturing that.

For keywords, they need to be relevant and no more than five. Looking at the content, "heroin crisis," "investigative journalism," "public records," "social media reporting," and "addiction storytelling" seem appropriate.

I also notice mentions of legal considerations and ethical issues, but I'll stick to the main points for keywords to keep it under five. 

Putting it all together, each key in the JSON should be properly enclosed in quotes, and values should follow the specified format. Making sure that authors is an array with one object containing Pat Beall's details.

I think that covers everything needed without adding any extra information or making up data where it's not present.
