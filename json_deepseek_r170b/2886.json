Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. The input they provided is in Spanish, which is about investigative reporting tips for sports investigations. Let me parse this carefully.

First, the user specified that the response must be only a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. They also mentioned that the id should be 2886. I need to make sure all these fields are included accurately.

Looking at the input, the title is "Consejos básicos para investigaciones deportivas" which translates to "Basic Tips for Sports Investigations." The conference is the IRE National Conference in Fort Worth, Texas, held on June 16, 2006. So the conference key will be "IRE," and the year is clearly listed as 2006.

Next, the author section. Duff Wilson from The New York Times is mentioned with his email and phone number. Since only name, email, and affiliation are needed, I'll include his name as "Duff Wilson" and set affiliation to "The New York Times." Email and other details aren't provided in the input, so those can be null.

For the description, it needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary. The input describes techniques like cultivating sources, investigating companies and individuals, using public records, and understanding legal standards. So I'll condense that into a concise summary about applying investigative techniques to sports stories with public policy implications.

Keywords are next. They should exclude the conference and authors, so I need relevant terms from the content. The main points are investigative journalism, sports investigations, sources, public records, NCAA regulations. That makes five keywords.

I must ensure all values are in English unless the original text is different, which it's Spanish but the JSON keys and values remain in English as per instructions. Also, every key and value should be enclosed in quotes.

Now, putting it all together into a properly formatted JSON object without any markdown. I'll structure each key with its corresponding value, making sure to handle lists and nulls appropriately.
