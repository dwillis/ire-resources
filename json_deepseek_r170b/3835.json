Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each key step by step.

First, the id is given as 3835, so that's straightforward. 

Next, the authors section. The speaker mentioned is Helene Sears from the BBC News Visual Journalism team. So her name is "Helene Sears." Her email is provided at the end: helene.sears@bbc.co.uk. Since she works for BBC News, her affiliation should be "BBC News Visual Journalism team."

The conference is IRE because it's from an IRE event, so that's set to "IRE". The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the text, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

For the title, the presentation is about information design and crossing the digital divide by Helene Sears. So a concise title would be "Information Design and Crossing the Digital Divide."

The description needs to summarize the content. It's about creating engaging visual stories that meet audience needs, so I'll write it as: "Tips on creating clear, engaging visual journalism that meets audience needs and tells compelling stories through design."

Keywords are next. The main points are information design, visual journalism, audience engagement, storytelling, and digital content. That makes five relevant terms.

I think that covers all the required keys with accurate information based on the input provided.
