Alright, so I'm trying to create this JSON object from the given input. Let me first read through what's provided.

The user has given a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference in Philadelphia in 2015. The speaker is Cheryl W. Thompson from The Washington Post and George Washington University. Her contact info is there too, along with her Twitter handle.

I need to structure this into a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id should be "4484_edit". 

Looking at the authors section, it's a list where each entry has name, email, and affiliation. Cheryl is listed as the author, so her details go here. Her email and Twitter are provided, but I think only the email goes into the JSON. Her affiliation is clearly The Washington Post and George Washington University.

The conference is obviously IRE since it's an IRE event in 2015. The year is specified as 2015. The title of the tipsheet seems to be "Strategies for Covering Criminal Justice: From Finding Enterprise Stories to Building Sources."

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet covers methods like using FOIA requests, developing sources, looking at crime trends, doing ridealongs, checking payroll and criminal records, attending hearings, reviewing complaints, lawsuits, and obtaining forms.

Keywords should be no more than five terms excluding the conference and authors. So maybe "criminal justice," "investigative reporting," "FOIA," "police accountability," "crime trends."

Putting it all together, I need to ensure each part is correctly placed in the JSON structure without any markdown or extra text.
