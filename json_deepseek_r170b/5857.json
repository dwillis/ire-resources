Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, I'll start with the "id" which is given as 5857. That's straightforward. Next, the "authors" are listed as Rachel Glickhouse from ProPublica and Sarah Childress from Frontline. Since their emails aren't provided, those will be null. The "conference" is clearly IRE, and the year is 2019 based on the tip sheet title mentioning IRE19.

For the "title," it's "Reporting on Hate." The "description" needs to be a concise summary of the tipsheet. I'll mention that it provides resources and tips for journalists investigating hate crimes, covering data sources, police training, and community engagement.

Now, "keywords" should include relevant terms like hate crimes, journalism resources, FBI data, police training, and community trust. These capture the main topics without including the conference or authors.

I need to ensure all keys are enclosed in quotes and that the JSON structure is valid. No markdown formatting, just plain JSON. Let me double-check each field to make sure I haven't missed any details from the tipsheet.

```json

    {

    },
    {

      "affiliation": "Frontline"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2019,
  "title": "Reporting on hate",
  "description": "A tipsheet providing resources and guidance for journalists investigating hate crimes, including data sources, police training materials, and strategies for effective reporting.",
  "keywords": [
    "hate crimes",
    "journalism resources",
    "FBI data",
    "police training",
