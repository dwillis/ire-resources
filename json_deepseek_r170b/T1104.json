Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's input. Let me start by understanding what they're asking for. They provided a list of stories from an investigative reporting project and specific instructions on how to structure the JSON.

First, the ID should be "T1104". That part seems straightforward. Next, authors is a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. But the user mentioned not to make up any names; if none are listed, leave them as null. Looking at the provided stories, I don't see any author names attached. So each author object will have name: null, email: null, and affiliation: "DICAR" since that's the news organization linked in the URLs.

The conference is either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". The input doesn't specify which conference this tipsheet is from, so I'll default to "Not Listed".

For the year, again, no specific information is given. So I'll set it as "Not Listed" as well.

The title should be the main topic of the tipsheet. Since all the stories relate to investigative reports by DICAR, I can use something like "Investigative Reports from DICAR Project".

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary in simple language. Each story covers different topics but they all seem to focus on investigative journalism pieces. So I'll write that it's a collection covering various issues.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking at the stories, keywords could be "Investigative Journalism", "DICAR", "Arizona Market", "Sex Trafficking", and "Business Crimes". These seem relevant and cover the main topics without overlapping with author or conference names.

Putting it all together, I structure each part step by step to ensure compliance with the user's specifications. Making sure all keys are in quotes and that null values are handled correctly.

```json
{
  "id": "T1104",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "DICAR"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigative Reports from DICAR Project",
  "description": "A collection of investigative stories covering topics such as Arizona Market, sex trafficking, and business unusual.",
  "keywords": [
    "Investigative Journalism",
    "DICAR",
    "Arizona Market",
    "Sex Trafficking",
    "Business Crimes"
  ]
}
```
