Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Brooke Williams' presentation at an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, the id is set to 5561 as per the user's instruction. Next, for authors, I need to extract details about Brooke Williams. Her name is clearly provided, but there's no email or affiliation listed in the tipsheet. So those will be null.

The conference is definitely IRE since it's mentioned at the top of the tipsheet. The year isn't specified, so I'll mark that as "Not Listed". 

Now, the title is straightforward: "Developing a Watchdog Mindset". For the description, I need to summarize the content in 1-2 sentences. The main points are about using documents and data to uncover systemic issues, cross-checking sources, and building datasets for impactful stories.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking at the tipsheet, relevant keywords would include "watchdog journalism", "investigative reporting", "document analysis", "data journalism", and "government accountability".

I need to ensure all keys are in English and properly enclosed in quotes without any markdown formatting.
