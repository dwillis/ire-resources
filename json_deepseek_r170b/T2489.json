Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given query and data. Let me break down what's required.

First, the structure: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The id is T2489 as specified.

Authors: The input lists Adam Symson from E.W. Scripps Broadcast Group. Since there's only one author mentioned, I'll create a list with his details. Name is "Adam Symson", email and affiliation are null because they aren't provided.

Conference: It says IRE Conference 2005, so conference should be "IRE".

Year: Clearly 2005.

Title: The title given in the input is "INVESTIGATING INFRASTRUCTURE: SOURCES FOR DATA". I'll use that exactly.

Description: Needs to be a concise summary. Looking at the data sources and tips provided, it's about infrastructure investigation resources. So something like "Tipsheet providing various data sources for investigating transportation, public safety, and infrastructure issues."

Keywords: The main topics covered are crash data, pothole complaints, Dept of Public Works info, road conditions databases, broken fire hydrants, federal contracts, moving violations databases, National Inventory of Dams, Coast Guard accidents, FAA incidents, emergency sirens, response times, snow removal maps, traffic flow, highway performance monitoring, and street lights. I need to pick up to five. The most significant ones seem to be "infrastructure investigation", "transportation data", "public safety data", "government contracts", and "road conditions". That covers the key areas.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part correctly, ensuring proper formatting and that all values are enclosed in quotes.
