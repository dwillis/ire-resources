Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference, specifically the NICAR Conference in Baltimore 2014. The user has given clear instructions on how each part of the JSON should be structured.

First, let's break down the input. The title of the tipsheet is "The Fine Art of Negotiating For Data." The authors listed are Ellen Gabler from The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel with her email, Andrew Lehren from The New York Times, and Joanna Lin from The Center for Investigative Reporting.

Looking at each section of the tipsheet, it's clear that this session covers strategies for obtaining data through FOIA requests. Key points include researching existing data sources, understanding when a FOIA is necessary, following the data trail across agencies, triangulating information, knowing what you need versus what you can settle for, crafting effective requests, understanding legal aspects, negotiating with agencies, talking tech to simplify processes, arguing fees, handling denials, and steps before an appeal.

The user wants this summarized in a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 4126. The authors are listed with their name, email, and affiliation. For Ellen Gabler, her affiliation is clear, but Andrew Lehren only has his name and email without an explicit affiliation beyond the news organization mentioned in the session. Similarly for Joanna Lin.

The description needs to be a concise summary of one or two sentences. It should capture that this tipsheet provides strategies for journalists to obtain data through FOIA requests by understanding sources, crafting effective requests, and negotiating with agencies.

Keywords are limited to five terms, excluding the conference and authors. So I'll pick relevant terms like "FOIA", "data acquisition", "negotiation", "journalism", and "investigative reporting".

Putting it all together, I need to structure each part accurately, ensuring no made-up names or affiliations. Emails are included if available, otherwise null.

I also need to make sure the JSON syntax is correct with proper quotation marks and commas. Each key must be enclosed in quotes, and the entire object should be properly formatted without any trailing commas that could cause errors.
