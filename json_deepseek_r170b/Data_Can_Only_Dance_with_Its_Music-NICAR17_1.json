Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, the structure should include id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is given as NICAR17_1, so that's straightforward.

Looking at the text provided, I see mentions of Carli Brosseau from The Oregonian, Andy Lehren from The New York Times, and Tom Johnson from the Institute for Analytic Journalism. Each author needs to be in a list with their name, email, and affiliation. Since emails aren't provided, they'll remain null.

The conference is NICAR since that's part of the id and mentioned in the slides. The year is 2017 as indicated by "NICAR17" and the date March 2017.

For the title, I'll use the main presentation title: "Data Can Only Dance with Its Music: Understanding the ecology of public data."

The description needs to be a concise summary. The text discusses overcoming challenges in accessing public data through FOIA requests and strategies. So, I'll summarize that it's about strategies for dealing with issues when obtaining public records.

Keywords should include relevant terms like "FOIA," "public records," "data access," "government transparency," and "journalism." These capture the essence without including the conference or authors.

Putting it all together, ensuring each part aligns with the instructions.
