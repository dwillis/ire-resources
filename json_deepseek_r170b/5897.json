Okay, I need to help the user by creating a JSON object based on their detailed query. They provided specific instructions about converting a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference into a structured format.

First, I'll identify the id as 5897 since that's what they specified. Next, looking at the authors section: Charlie Specht is listed with his email and affiliation to WKBW-TV. So, I'll include him in the authors list with the provided details.

The conference is clearly mentioned as "IRE" and the year is 2019, so those fields are straightforward. The title of the tipsheet is "Holding them Accountable (When you don’t get the interview)" which I can take directly from their input.

For the description, I need a concise summary. The main idea is about strategies when interviews aren't granted, focusing on public statements and accountability. I'll phrase it simply to fit in one or two sentences.

Keywords should be relevant and limited to five. Looking through the tipsheet content, terms like "accountability," "public statements," "leadership," "investigative journalism," and "transparency" stand out as key themes.

I need to ensure all values are in English and correctly formatted with quotes. I'll structure each part carefully, making sure not to include any extra information beyond what's provided.
