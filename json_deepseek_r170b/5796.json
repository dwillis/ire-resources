Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the ID is given as 5796, so that's straightforward. Next, I have to list the authors with their details. Looking at the document, there are three speakers: Ranjani Chakraborty, Blake Nelson, and Hilke Schellmann. Each has an email and possibly an affiliation.

For each author:
- Ranjani Chakraborty's email is ranjani.chakraborty@vox.com, so her affiliation should be Vox.
- Blake Nelson's email is bnelson@njadvancemedia.com, so his affiliation is NJ Advance Media.
- Hilke Schellmann's email is hilke.schellmann@nyu.edu, so her affiliation is NYU.

The conference is IRE since it's mentioned at the top. The year isn't provided, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed". 

The title of the tipsheet is "Bring your investigative reporting to life using animation and illustrations." For the description, I need a concise summary: It discusses how animations and visuals can enhance investigative stories, covering research, production, writing, and design steps.

Keywords should be relevant terms from the content. I'll choose "animation", "illustrations", "investigative journalism", "visual storytelling", and "multimedia reporting".

I have to make sure all keys are in quotes and the structure is correct without any markdown formatting.
