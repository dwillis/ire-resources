Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's instructions from the provided tipsheet. The input contains details about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference session titled "How to Use Data About U.S. Terrorism Cases," presented by Trevor Aaronson and Margot Williams in Orlando, June 2018.

First, I'll identify the required keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 5719. 

Next, for the authors, each should have name, email, and affiliation. The names are Trevor Aaronson and Margot Williams. Emails aren't provided, so they'll be null. Affiliation: since they're from IRE, that's their affiliation.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE in Orlando 2018, so conference is "IRE" and year is 2018. 

Title is straightforward: "How to Use Data About U.S. Terrorism Cases".

Description needs a concise summary. The tipsheet describes how the database was built using various sources and tools, and suggests ways journalists can use this data for their stories.

Keywords should be relevant terms from the content. I'll choose "terrorism cases," "data journalism," "U.S. Department of Justice," "database reporting," and "investigative research."

Putting it all together ensures each field is correctly populated with the appropriate values, adhering to the user's specifications.
