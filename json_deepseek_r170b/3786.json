Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from Greg LeRoy at Good Jobs First for an IRE conference in Boston, 2012.

First, the id is provided as 3786. So that's straightforward.

Next, authors: The main author mentioned is Greg LeRoy, who is the Executive Director of Good Jobs First. His email is goodjobs@goodjobsfirst.org and his affiliation is clearly Good Jobs First. There are no other authors listed, so the authors list will only have this one entry with all details filled in.

The conference is IRE since it's part of Investigative Reporters and Editors.

Year is 2012 as stated in the document.

Title: The main topic is about Economic Development Subsidies worth $70 Billion. So I'll title it accordingly.

Description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet discusses how state and local governments spend billions on subsidies, highlighting issues like job blackmail and lack of transparency, while providing resources for journalists.

Keywords should include terms like "economic development", "subsidies", "corporate incentives", "job creation", and "tax breaks" as they are central to the content.

Putting it all together, I structure each part ensuring all keys are included with correct values. Make sure the JSON syntax is correct, using quotes appropriately.
