Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id is given as 3577, so that's straightforward.

Looking at the authors section, Daniel Connolly is mentioned along with his email and affiliation, The (Memphis) Commercial Appeal. So I'll list him as an author with those details.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE Orlando, so the conference key will be "IRE" and the year is 2011.

For the title, it's about covering transborder issues when not living near the border, which I can paraphrase to make it concise.

The description needs a 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet talks about investigating cross-border topics like illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and using international driverâ€™s licenses as ID. So I'll summarize that.

Keywords should be relevant terms: "transborder issues", "immigration", "drug trafficking", "investigative journalism", "international crime". I need to keep it under five, but since the user didn't specify, maybe just include the most important ones.

Now, putting it all together in JSON format with proper structure and ensuring all keys are enclosed in quotes.
