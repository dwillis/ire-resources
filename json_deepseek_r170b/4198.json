Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's instructions from the provided tipsheet. Let me start by understanding what each key requires.

First, the id should be 4198 as specified. Next, authors is a list where each element has name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the input, Evan Stulberger is the author with his email and affiliation listed, so I'll include that. There's no other author mentioned, so the list will have only one entry.

The conference is clearly labeled as IRE14, so conference should be "IRE" and year will be 2014 since it's IRE 2014. The title is straightforward: "Visualizing the Investigative Story."

For the description, I need a concise summary of the tipsheet content. It focuses on enhancing video quality in investigative journalism through creative techniques despite challenges like poor footage.

Keywords should include terms that capture the essence without being too broad. I'll go with "investigative journalism," "video production," "creative techniques," "storytelling," and "journalism resources."

I must ensure all values are in English, keys are enclosed in quotes, and the structure follows JSON syntax correctly.
