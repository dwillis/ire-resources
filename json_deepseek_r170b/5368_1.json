Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided input. The user has given me a lot of URLs and some text that seems related to Facebook searches for investigative journalism purposes. 

First, looking at the structure they want: id is 5368_1, which is straightforward. Authors are in a list, each with name, email, and affiliation. Since the original tip sheet mentions Molly Young from The Oregonian, I'll include her as the author. Email isn't provided, so it remains null.

The conference is NICAR because the document header says "NICAR 2018". Year is clearly 2018. The title is "Hacking Facebook searches" which is mentioned at the top. 

For the description, it's a one to two sentence summary. I'll say it's a tip sheet on using Facebook for investigative reporting, covering search techniques and state-specific resources.

Keywords should be up to five terms related to the content. So, Facebook, Investigative journalism, Social media research, Search techniques, and State-specific data make sense.

I think that covers all the requirements without adding any extra information or making anything up.

    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",

  "description": "A tip sheet on using Facebook for investigative reporting, including search techniques and state-specific resources.",
  "keywords": [
