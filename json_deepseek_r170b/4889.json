Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The input provided includes details about a panel discussion titled "When journalism and security research collide." 

First, I'll start by identifying each required key for the JSON object: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

The id is given as 4889, so that's straightforward. Next, looking at the authors section. The panelists listed are Cora Currier from The Intercept, Yael Grauer who is an independent journalist, Dave Maass from EFF, and Jeremy Gillula also from EFF. Their Twitter handles are provided, but I don't see emails or affiliations beyond their organizations. So each author entry will have a name, email as null since it's not provided, and affiliation as their respective organizations.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, and the year is 2016 based on the header. The title of the tipsheet is "When journalism and security research collide." 

For the description, I need a concise summary in 1-2 sentences. It should explain how journalists and security researchers can collaborate to investigate and break stories. I'll make sure it's simple and clear.

Now, keywords. They must be no more than five terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking through the content, relevant keywords could be "collaboration," "investigative journalism," "security research," "FOIA," and "surveillance." These capture the essence without overlapping with the conference or author names.

Putting it all together, each part is mapped to its respective key in JSON format. I need to ensure proper syntax with quotes around all keys and values, commas separating the items, and no trailing commas which could cause errors.
