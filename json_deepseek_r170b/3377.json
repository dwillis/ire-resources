Alright, so I need to create a JSON object from the provided tipsheet. Let me go through this step by step.

First, looking at the input, the tipsheet number is 3377. So the id will definitely be 3377. That's straightforward.

Next, the authors section. The tipsheet was written by Alec Klein. I don't see any other authors mentioned here. Now, for each author entry, we need name, email, and affiliation. Since only Alec Klein is listed, but there's no email or affiliation provided in the text, those fields will be null.

Moving on to the conference. The tipsheet comes from the "Donald W. Reynolds National Center for Business Journalism" which is part of Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE). So I'll set the conference key to "IRE".

The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the provided text, so according to instructions, it should be "Not Listed". 

For the title, it's clearly stated as "Investigative business reporting – Handout".

Now, the description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet provides various online resources for investigative business journalists. So I'll write something concise like: "A collection of online resources and tools for investigative business journalism."

Keywords are next. They should be no more than five terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords would be "business journalism", "investigative reporting", "online resources", and "research tools". That's four, so I'll stick with those.

Putting it all together, I structure each key accordingly ensuring all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes.
