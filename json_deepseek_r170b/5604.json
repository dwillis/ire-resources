Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet by Michael J. Berens from Thomson Reuters. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the id is given as 5604, so that part is straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors section. The source lists "Michael J. Berens" with an email and affiliation. Since his name is provided, I can include it along with his email and company, Thomson Reuters.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's set.

For the year, the input doesn't specify when the event took place, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

The title isn't explicitly given, but from the content, it seems to be about classifying sources for journalists. So a suitable title would be "Classifying Sources: Strategies for Journalists".

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The text talks about categorizing sources into 10 types and strategies to approach them. So I'll write something like, "A tipsheet on classifying sources into 10 categories and strategies for effective interviewing."

Keywords should capture the main points: source classification, interviewing strategies, journalist resources.

Putting it all together, each part is addressed without any missing information. I think that covers everything the user asked for.
