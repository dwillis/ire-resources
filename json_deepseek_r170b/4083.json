Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conferences. Let me break down what I have here.

First, the user specified several keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The ID is given as 4083, so that's straightforward.

Looking at the content, there are two presenters mentioned: Noah Veltman from WNYC and Tom MacWright from MapBox. Their contact info isn't provided, so emails will be null, but their affiliations are clear from their respective organizations.

The conference is NICAR14, which I know stands for the 2014 NICAR Conference. So the year should be 2014, not "Not Listed".

The title of the tipsheet seems to be about creating maps, with a focus on principles, mistakes, and potential. So I can structure that as the main title.

For the description, it's a summary in simple terms. The tipsheet covers tools and techniques for making maps, including various software and data sources. That should be concise, maybe two sentences.

Keywords need to be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords would include mapping tools, GIS, cartography, data visualization, and geospatial data. These are all central to the tipsheet's content.

Putting it all together, I make sure each part fits into the JSON structure without any markdown or extra text, just a clean object with proper syntax.
