Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me start by identifying each required key.

First, the id is straightforward: "4112_Tipsheet".

Next, looking for authors. The document mentions Keith Taylor with his email and affiliation as the St. Louis Fed. There's also a general FRED Team contact, but no specific author names are listed beyond Keith. So, I'll include him in the authors array.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE".

For the year, the tipsheet doesn't provide a specific event date, so it should be "Not Listed".

The title should capture the essence of the tipsheet: "Local/Regional Story Ideas Using FRED® Economic Data".

Now, the description needs to be concise. The tipsheet offers local story ideas using FRED data, covering unemployment, housing, economic growth, etc. So a 1-2 sentence summary would work.

Keywords should include relevant terms like "FRED", "economic data", "unemployment", "housing market", and "local reporting".

I also need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. No markdown, just plain JSON.

  "description": "A tipsheet providing local and regional story ideas using data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) tool, covering topics such as unemployment rates, housing market trends, economic growth, and more.",
  "keywords": [
    "FRED",
    "economic data",
