Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from Google about Fusion Tables at an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I look for the id. The user mentioned it should be "3851_Schneider". That seems straightforward.

Next, authors. Vanessa Schneider is listed with her email and affiliation as Google. There's no other author mentioned, so that part is clear.

The conference is identified as IRE since the document mentions "Investigative Reporters and Editors." So the conference field will be "IRE".

Looking for the year, I scan through the text but don't see any specific year mentioned. So I'll set it to "Not Listed" as per instructions.

For the title, the main topic is Google Fusion Tables, so that's easy.

The description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. The tipsheet covers using Fusion Tables for data visualization and mapping, so I'll note how it helps journalists present data effectively.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Terms like "data visualization", "mapping tools", "journalism tools", "Fusion Tables", and "Google tools" fit well here.

I don't see any need for additional notes since all required fields are covered, so I'll leave that as null.

Putting it all together, the JSON should have each key properly filled with the extracted information.
