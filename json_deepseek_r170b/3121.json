Alright, so I'm trying to create a JSON object based on the user's query about Consumer Investigations. Let me break down what they need.

First, the JSON should have specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is given as 3121, so that's straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors section. I see three names mentioned with their emails and affiliations. Jacqueline McLean from WFTC-TV Minneapolis, Robin Guess from WFTS-TV Tampa, and Lea Thompson from NBC News Dateline. I need to structure each author as an object with name, email, and affiliation. Since their affiliations are clear from the text, I can fill those in without issues.

The conference is listed as "IRE" because the user mentioned it's part of the 2005 IRE CONFERENCE - DENVER. So that's set under the conference key.

For the year, it's clearly stated as 2005, so that goes into the year field.

The title should be the main heading of the document, which is "Consumer Investigations." That makes sense for the title.

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary in simple language. The text includes various resources and websites related to consumer protection, so I'll write something like: "A collection of resources and online tools for investigating consumer issues, including government agencies and fraud prevention sites."

Keywords are next. They should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords would be "consumer investigations," "fraud prevention," "government agencies," "online resources," and "reporting tools." I'll list those in order.

I need to make sure all values are enclosed in quotes and that everything is properly formatted as a JSON object. No markdown should be included, so I'll present it cleanly without any extra formatting.
