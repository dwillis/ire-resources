Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id should be T1979 as specified.

Next, for the authors section, there's only one author mentioned: Kim Christensen. His email is kchristensen@news.oregonian.com, and his affiliation is The Oregonian. So I'll list him with these details.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE Better Watchdog Workshop in Fullerton, California, on February 7, 2004. So the conference key will be "IRE" and the year is 2004.

The title of the tipsheet is "COURT RECORDS: MINING FOR GOLD".

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet explains how court records are valuable for journalists researching various cases and individuals. It also provides guidance on where to find these records and how to use them effectively. So I'll summarize that in one or two sentences.

Keywords should be relevant and no more than five. Looking at the content, appropriate keywords could be "court records", "investigative reporting", "civil lawsuits", "criminal cases", and "document analysis".

I need to ensure all keys are enclosed in quotes and the structure is correct without any markdown formatting.
