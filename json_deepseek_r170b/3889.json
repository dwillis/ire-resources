Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors conference. The user has provided detailed content about business investigations by Rob Barry from The Wall Street Journal.

First, I'll parse through the document to extract necessary information. The id is already specified as 3889. 

Next, for the authors section, there's only one author mentioned: Rob Barry with his email and affiliation to WSJ. So the authors list will have one object with name, email, and affiliation.

The conference isn't explicitly stated in the text, but since it's from IRE (Investigative Reporters and Editors), I'll set that as the conference value.

Looking for the year, the document doesn’t mention a specific year, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

For the title, the header mentions "Business Investigations," which seems appropriate. 

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers tools like SEC filings and other resources, so I'll summarize that.

Keywords should include terms like business investigations, SEC filings, public records, financial data, etc.—keeping it to five relevant terms without including the conference or author names.

Putting it all together, ensuring all keys are correctly formatted as per JSON standards.
