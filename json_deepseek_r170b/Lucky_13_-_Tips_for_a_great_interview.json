Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I'll identify the key elements required: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

Starting with the ID: The user wants it to be "_Tips_for_a_great_interview". That seems straightforward.

Next, authors. Looking at the text, there are two contacts listed: Marisa Kwiatkowski and Mike Rezendes. Each has an email and a Twitter handle, but no explicit affiliations mentioned except their emails. For Marisa, her email is @indystar.com, so I can infer that her affiliation is "IndyStar". Similarly, Mike's email is @gmail.com, which doesn't indicate his affiliation, so I'll leave it as null.

Conference: The tipsheet mentions it's from an IRE conference, so the conference key should be "IRE".

Year: There’s no specific year mentioned in the text, so I’ll set it to "Not Listed".

Title: The main heading is "Lucky 13 Tips for a good interview", but since JSON keys are case-sensitive and typically use snake_case or similar, maybe it's better as "Tips for a Good Interview". However, the example response used "TIPSHEET" in the title. I think using the actual title from the text would be more accurate, so I'll go with what's provided.

Description: A 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet provides 13 tips on how to conduct effective interviews, focusing on building trust and approaching sources effectively. So the description should capture that essence concisely.

Keywords: Up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking at the content, keywords could be "interview techniques", "source relationships", "investigative journalism", "communication skills". These seem relevant without overlapping with other keys.

Putting it all together:

- id: "_Tips_for_a_great_interview"
- authors: array with two objects, each having name, email, affiliation.
- conference: "IRE"
- year: "Not Listed"
- title: The exact title from the text, probably "TIPSHEET: LUCKY 13 Tips for a good interview" as in the example.
- description: A concise summary of the tipsheet content.
- keywords: List of relevant terms.

I also need to ensure all values are enclosed in quotes and proper formatting. I think the provided JSON meets these criteria, so I'll structure it accordingly without making up any information not present in the text.
