Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, the id is given as 5342, so that's straightforward. 

Next, the authors are Regina Compton and Derek Eder. I don't see any emails or affiliations listed for them in the input, so their email and affiliation will be null.

The conference is NICAR18, which is part of IRE, so the conference key should be "NICAR". The year isn't explicitly mentioned, but since it's NICAR18, that implies 2018, so I'll set the year to 2018.

For the title, the session is called "Maps Made Easy," so that will be the title. 

The description needs to be a brief summary in simple language. The session focuses on using Google Fusion Tables for mapping, covering creation of maps with points and polygons, geocoding, and additional resources for customization. So I'll craft a concise sentence summarizing this.

Keywords should include terms like "mapping," "Fusion Tables," "geocoding," "GIS," and "data visualization." These are the main topics covered in the session.

Putting it all together, I structure each key with appropriate values, ensuring that all are enclosed in quotes as per JSON standards.

```json
{
  "id": 5342,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": 2018,
  "title": "Maps Made Easy - Agenda & Tip Sheet",
  "description": "This session covers how to create interactive maps using Google Fusion Tables, including geocoding and customizing map styles.",
  "keywords": ["mapping", "Fusion Tables", "geocoding", "GIS", "data visualization"]
}
```
