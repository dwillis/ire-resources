Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The user provided specific instructions on the structure, so first, I'll identify all the required keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

The id is given as 4882, so that's straightforward. Next, the authors section should be a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. From the input, Maya Lau is listed as the author. Her emails are mlau@theadvocate.com and lau.maya@gmail.com, but I'll include both if possible. The affiliation is clearly The Advocate (Baton Rouge, La.), so that goes in there.

The conference is IRE, and the year is 2016 since it's mentioned as New Orleans 2016. The title of the tipsheet is "Investigating on the local criminal justice beat," which I'll use exactly as given. 

For the description, I need a concise summary in simple language. The tipsheet provides strategies for reporters new to covering criminal justice, including building sources and using public records. So, the description should capture that essence succinctly.

Keywords are next. They must be no more than five terms. From the content, "criminal justice," "investigative reporting," "public records," "source building," and "local government" seem relevant. I'll make sure to exclude any mentions of the conference or authors as per instructions.

I also need to ensure all values are in English unless specified otherwise, which they are here. All keys and string values must be enclosed in double quotes. 

Looking back at the input, there’s no mention of co-authors, so I'll only include Maya Lau in the authors list. The user emphasized not making up names, so if any info is missing, it should remain null, but in this case, all necessary details are provided.

Double-checking everything: id is correct, authors have all the required fields filled, conference and year are accurate, title is exact, description is a clear summary, and keywords are relevant and within the limit. 

I think that's all covered. Now, I'll structure it into the JSON format as specified.
