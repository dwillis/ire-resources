Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on this tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference in Denver back in 2005. The title of the session is "Natural disaster investigations: From forest fires to hurricanes." 

First, let's parse through the information given. There are two authors listed: Sally Kestin and Megan O’Matz. Both work for the South Florida Sun-Sentinel as investigative reporters. Their contact details include phone numbers and email addresses. I should note their names, affiliations, and emails.

The tipsheet describes an investigation by the Sun-Sentinel where FEMA distributed over $31 million to Miami-Dade County after Hurricane Frances, which didn't actually hit that area. This led to federal investigations and reforms. The document also provides methods for journalists to investigate disaster aid, such as analyzing FEMA data, checking damage assessments, and reviewing claims.

Now, the JSON structure needs specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. 

- **id**: Given as T2433.
- **authors**: A list of objects with name, email, affiliation. Both authors are from the South Florida Sun-Sentinel, so their affiliations should reflect that.
- **conference**: It's an IRE event, so "IRE".
- **year**: Clearly stated as 2005.
- **title**: The session title provided is "Natural disaster investigations: From forest fires to hurricanes."
- **description**: Needs a concise summary. Maybe something like: "Tipsheet on investigating FEMA aid distribution and inspector backgrounds after natural disasters, highlighting methods for journalists to uncover discrepancies in claims and oversight."
- **keywords**: Relevant terms without including the conference or authors. Possible keywords are "FEMA," "disaster investigations," "inspectors," "fraud," "journalism."

I should ensure all values are correctly formatted, with proper use of quotes and commas. Also, make sure no additional information is included beyond what's necessary for each key.

Putting it all together, the JSON should accurately reflect the tipsheet content while adhering to the specified structure.
