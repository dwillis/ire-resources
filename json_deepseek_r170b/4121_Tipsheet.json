Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given input. The input includes tips for using Excel functions like IF statements, SEARCH, and more, presented by MaryJo Webster from Star Tribune. The conference is IRE 2004.

First, I'll identify the keys needed: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The id should be "4121_Tipsheet". 

For authors, there's only one author mentioned: MaryJo Webster. Her email and affiliation aren't provided, but since she's from Star Tribune, that will be her affiliation. So her details are name: "MaryJo Webster", email: null, affiliation: "Star Tribune".

The conference is clearly stated as IRE 2004, so the year is 2004.

The title of the tipsheet is "Excel Tips for Journalists".

The description needs to be a brief summary. It should mention that the tipsheet covers Excel functions like IF statements and SEARCH, helping journalists analyze data.

For keywords, I'll pick relevant terms: "Excel", "IF statements", "SEARCH function", "data analysis", "journalism tools". These are all key concepts from the text.

I need to make sure all values are in English and enclosed in quotes. Also, ensure that if any information isn't available, it's set to null, like MaryJo's email here.

Now, I'll structure this into a JSON object with proper formatting.
