Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has specific instructions, so I should make sure each part is addressed carefully.

First, the ID is given as 4704, so that's straightforward. 

Next, for the authors, there are several panelists mentioned: Kenan Davis from The Guardian, Gabriel Dance and Tom Meagher from The Marshall Project, Jodi Upton from USA Today, and Steven Rich from The Washington Post. Each of these should be included in an array under "authors." Since emails aren't provided, they'll all be null. Affiliations are the news organizations listed next to their names.

The conference is IRE's 2016 CAR conference in Denver, so the "conference" key will be "IRE" and the year is clearly 2016.

For the title, it should exactly match what's given: "Risks and Rewards of Rolling Your Own Criminal Justice Data."

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet discusses building criminal justice databases, including projects from various news outlets and advice on best practices. So I'll condense that into a 1-2 sentence overview.

Keywords should exclude the conference and authors but include relevant terms like "criminal justice data," "database construction," "investigative journalism," etc., up to five terms.

I need to ensure all keys are in quotes and values as well, with proper structure. No markdown, just plain JSON.

Double-checking everything: ID correct, authors listed properly with affiliations, conference details accurate, description clear, keywords relevant. Looks good.
