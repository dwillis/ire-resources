Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The user provided specific instructions, so let me go through this step by step.

First, I'll start by identifying each required key for the JSON object: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The id is given as 5369. That part's straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors. There are three presenters mentioned: Jayme Fraser, Rachel Alexander, and Kai Teoh. I need to extract their details. For each author, I'll note their name, email, and affiliation.

- **Jayme Fraser**: Her affiliation is The Malheur Enterprise and ProPublica Local Reporting Network. No email provided.
- **Rachel Alexander**: She's a health reporter/data geek but no specific news organization mentioned except the one where she deleted the homepage. That might be too vague for an affiliation, so I'll leave it as null.
- **Kai Teoh**: Affiliated with The Spokesman-Review.

Emails aren't provided in the text, so they will remain null.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's set.

The year isn't mentioned anywhere in the text, so I'll put "Not Listed".

For the title, it seems to be about recycling data and code, but looking at the content, the specific topic is "Recycle Your Data, Viz and Code". That makes sense as a title.

The description needs to be 1-2 sentences. The tipsheet focuses on maximizing work value through reusability. So something like: "Maximize the value of your work by reusing data, visualizations, and code through quick updates."

Keywords should include up to five terms. From the content, relevant terms are recycling data, journalism tools, data reuse, investigative reporting, and efficient reporting.

Now, putting it all together in JSON format with proper structure.
