Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let's start by identifying each required key.

The id is given as T1991. 

Next, looking for authors. The document mentions Nils Mulvad from Dicar with his email nils.mulvad@dicar.dk. So the authors array will have one object with name "Nils Mulvad", email as provided, and affiliation as "Dicar".

The conference is IRE since that's where this tipsheet is from.

The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the text, so it'll be "Not Listed".

For the title, the main heading is about tactical considerations when applying for access to documents and data. So I'll condense that into a concise title.

The description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet provides practical advice on accessing documents across different countries, so I'll note that it offers strategies and methods for journalists.

Keywords should include relevant terms like "document access", "FOIA", "journalism", "transparency", and "investigative reporting". These capture the essence without including the conference name or authors.

Now, putting all these together into a JSON structure with proper formatting.

```json
{
  "id": "T1991",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Nils Mulvad",
      "email": "nils.mulvad@dicar.dk",
      "affiliation": "Dicar"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Tactical considerations when applying for access to documents and data",
  "description": "This tipsheet provides practical advice on how journalists can effectively apply for access to documents and data, including strategies for working with authorities and understanding legal frameworks.",
  "keywords": [
    "document access",
    "FOIA",
    "journalism",
    "transparency",
    "investigative reporting"
  ]
}
```
