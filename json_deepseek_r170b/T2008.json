Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me go through each requirement step by step.

First, the id should be T2008 as specified. The authors section needs to include Brad Heath with his email and affiliation from The Detroit News. Since there are no other authors mentioned, I'll just list him.

Next, the conference is clearly IRE because that's what the user provided in their example. The year isn't explicitly stated, so I'll set it as "Not Listed".

The title of the tipsheet is given as "Schools: Teachers, Contracts and Discipline". For the description, I need a concise summary. It should mention tracking school finances and the sources available like Arizona State University, NCES, U.S. Census Bureau, and state departments.

Keywords are limited to five terms excluding conference and authors. I'll choose public schools, education management, school finance, administrative spending, and charter schools since they're relevant topics.

I have to ensure all keys are in quotes and the structure follows the user's instructions precisely without adding any extra information.
