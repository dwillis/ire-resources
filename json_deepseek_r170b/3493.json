Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has provided specific instructions for each key, so let me go through them step by step.

First, the `id` is straightforward—it's given as 3493. Next, the `authors` section. The document lists John Stasko with his email and affiliation to Georgia Tech. There are other team members mentioned, like Carsten Görg and others, but their emails aren't provided. Since I shouldn't make up names or details, I'll only include John Stasko with the available information and leave others as null or not listed.

The `conference` is clearly "IRE" since it's from an IRE event. The year is given as 2011 in the tipsheet header. 

For the `title`, "Jigsaw: Visualization for Investigative Analysis across Document Collections" seems appropriate based on the content.

The `description` needs to be a concise summary. Jigsaw helps investigators analyze large document collections by identifying entities and their connections, so I'll phrase it simply like that.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. The tipsheet mentions "document analysis," "entity identification," "data visualization," "investigative journalism," and "intelligence analysis" as relevant topics.

I also need to ensure all values are in English and properly quoted, with no markdown formatting. Double-checking each key to make sure nothing's missed, especially handling cases where information isn't provided by setting them to null or appropriate defaults.
