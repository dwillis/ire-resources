Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given input. Let me go through the query step by step.

First, the user provided a tipsheet from an IRE conference. The main points are about integrating Computer-Assisted Reporting (CAR) into daily journalism beats. They mentioned Kate Martin as the speaker with her contact info and affiliation.

I need to structure this into JSON with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

Starting with the ID, it's given as 3617. The conference is NICAR in 2012, so I can fill that in. The title is "Integrating CAR into a daily beat."

For the authors section, Kate Martin is listed along with her email and affiliation, Skagit Valley Herald. Since there are no other authors mentioned, the list will have only one entry.

The description needs to be concise. I'll summarize how CAR can help journalists by accessing public records like salary databases for reporting on government activities efficiently.

Keywords should include terms related to the content: computer-assisted reporting, public records, salary data, journalism tools, and government accountability. These are all relevant without including the conference or author names.

I must ensure all keys and values are in English and properly quoted. Also, no made-up names; since only Kate Martin is listed, others aren't included.
