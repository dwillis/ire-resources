Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference session. Let me break down what they've asked for.

First, the structure: the JSON should have keys like id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is given as "4948_notes". 

Next, looking at the input provided, it's about an "Algorithmic accountability panel" from NICAR17. So the conference is NICAR, which I know stands for National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting. The year should be 2017 since that's what NICAR17 implies.

The title of the session is clearly stated as "Algorithmic accountability panel". Now, for the description, it needs to be a concise summary in 1-2 sentences. The input describes how algorithms impact public and private sectors, making decisions affecting lives, and the session discusses strategies for investigating this. I'll condense that into a simple summary.

Now, the authors section is a bit tricky. The user provided four speakers: Julia Angwin, Sam Corbett-Davies, Nick Diakopoulos, and Greg Linch as the moderator. Each author should be an object with name, email, and affiliation. Since emails aren't provided, those will be null. Affiliations are based on their current roles mentionedâ€”ProPublica for Julia, Stanford for Sam, University of Maryland for Nick, and McClatchy for Greg.

For keywords, I need up to five terms excluding the conference and authors' names. The topics include algorithmic accountability, investigation methods, transparency, bias in algorithms, and fairness. So those would be my keywords.

I also have to make sure that all values are enclosed in quotes and the JSON is properly formatted without any markdown. Since the user provided a sample output, I can model mine similarly but ensure each part aligns with their instructions.

Wait, the speakers' section had four names, so the authors list should include all four. Also, Greg Linch was the moderator, so his role is noted as such in the description but doesn't need a separate field here; just his affiliation and name are enough.

Let me make sure each part of the JSON aligns with the keys specified: id, authors array with each author's details, conference set to "NICAR", year as 2017, title correctly captured, a clear description, and relevant keywords.

I think that covers all the requirements. Now I'll structure it into the JSON format accordingly.
