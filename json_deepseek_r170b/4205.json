Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an IRE conference. The user has given specific instructions on how each key should be populated.

First, the id is fixed at 4205. That's straightforward.

Next, authors are listed with their name, email, and affiliation. Looking through the text, there are four panelists and a moderator: Jeffrey Ball, Jeff St. John, Ucilia Wang, Mary Fricker as moderator, but she's not an author in this context, so I think only the three panelists are considered authors.

For each author:
- Jeffrey Ball has his name, email is listed as null since it's not provided, and affiliation is "Stanford University" mentioned after his name.
- Jeff St. John: same approach, no email, affiliation is "Greentech Media".
- Ucilia Wang: email is null, affiliation is "Forbes".

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's set.

Year is 2014 since the tipsheet references June 21, 2014, in one of the stories.

Title should be a concise version of what the session is about. The original title seems to focus on renewable energy financing and solar securitization.

Description needs to be a short summary. It's about exploring financial innovations, challenges, and opportunities in the renewable sector.

Keywords are up to five terms. I'll pick renewable energy, solar, financing, securitization, and clean energy.

Putting it all together, ensuring that each key is properly quoted and values are correctly formatted.
