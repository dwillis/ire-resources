Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, the id is straightforward; it should be 3804 as specified. 

Next, looking at the authors section, I need a list of elements each containing name, email, and affiliation. The only author mentioned here is Lauren Hasler. Her email is provided: lhasler@wisconsinwatch.org, and her affiliation is clearly stated as WisconsinWatch.org.

The conference is listed in the text as "IRE", so that's set for the conference key. However, the year isn't specified anywhere in the document, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

For the title, the tipsheet seems to be about tracking impact, which makes sense given the content. The description should be a concise summary of what Lauren covered, mainly setting up systems to track story pickups and using tools like Google Alerts and spreadsheets.

Keywords need to be relevant terms that summarize the content without including the conference or authors. From the tipsheet, appropriate keywords could include "impact tracking", "story pickups", "Google Alerts", "spreadsheets", and "media analytics".

I should ensure all values are in English unless otherwise stated and enclose everything in quotes as per JSON standards.
