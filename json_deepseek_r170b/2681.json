Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user provided a detailed tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference about investigating European agricultural businesses. My task is to create a JSON object with specific keys based on the given input.

First, I'll identify the required keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The user specified that the id should be 2681, so that's straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors section. There are two panelists mentioned: John Burnett and Brigitte Alfter. Brigitte has an email (brig@mail.dk) and is affiliated with Danish daily Information. John doesn't have an email listed, so I'll set his email to null. For affiliation, since only Brigitte's is provided, John's will also be null unless there's a news organization mentioned elsewhere. In this case, it's just Danish daily for Brigitte.

The conference is clearly stated as the "IRE" annual event in Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, so that's set under the conference key.

For the year, the tipsheet doesn't explicitly mention the year, only the date (June 18). Since the user says to use "Not Listed" if not clearly identified, I'll go with that.

The title comes from the heading: "Investigando el negocio agr√≠cola." but needs to be in English. Translating it gives "Investigating Agricultural Business."

Now, the description must be a concise 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet discusses how half of the EU's budget goes into agriculture subsidies and the challenges in accessing subsidy data through FOI requests. So, I'll summarize that.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Relevant terms are "agricultural subsidies," "freedom of information (FOI)," "European Union," "transparency," and "data access."

Putting it all together, I structure the JSON with each key properly filled out, ensuring correct data types and enclosures in quotes as specified.
