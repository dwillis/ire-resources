Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON.

First, the id is given as 3535, so that's straightforward. Next, for authors, I see multiple presenters listed with their names, emails, and affiliations. Each author should be an object in a list. I need to extract each person's name, email, and their affiliation. For example, John Christie's email is mainecenter@gmail.com and his affiliation is Maine Center for Public Interest Reporting.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE Annual Conference, so that goes under the "conference" key with value "IRE". The year of the event is 2011, which is explicitly mentioned. 

For the title, it's "Lessons Learned in Creating Investigative Centers", taken from the tipsheet's heading. The description needs to be a concise summary of the content. Looking at the text, the main focus is on starting and managing investigative centers, covering topics like planning, editorial practices, finances, and administration. So I'll condense that into a couple of sentences.

Keywords should include terms relevant to the content but exclude the conference name and authors. The tipsheet covers Nonprofit Management, Investigative Journalism, Startups, Fundraising, and Editorial Practices. These seem appropriate as keywords.

I need to ensure all keys are in quotes, proper nesting for authors, and that all values are correctly formatted. Also, make sure there's no markdown or extra text outside the JSON structure.
