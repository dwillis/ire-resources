Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conferences. The user has given specific instructions on how each key should be filled.

First, the id is straightforward: it's given as 4642_1. Next, for authors, the input doesn't list any names, so I'll set name to null, email and affiliation to null as well since there's no information provided.

The conference is clearly IRE, so that goes into the conference key. The year isn't specified in the text, so it should be "Not Listed".

For the title, the tipsheet is about handling breaking news data, so I'll name it accordingly. 

The description needs to be a concise summary of the content. It's about strategies for journalists covering breaking news, including preparation and using data effectively.

Keywords are next. I need up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords could be "breaking news", "data journalism", "investigative reporting", "preparedness", and "contextual reporting".

Putting it all together, each key is filled as per instructions, ensuring no made-up data and proper formatting.
