Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, looking at their input, it's a list of 10 steps to achieve greater diversity among investigative journalists by Mizell Stewart III, Yolanda Martinez, Tracie Powell, and Mark J. Rochester, presented at the 2018 IRE CAR conference in Chicago.

The user wants me to structure this into a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 5365, which I'll use directly. 

For the authors section, each should be an object with name, email, and affiliation. Since the original text doesn't provide emails or affiliations for these individuals, those fields will be null. But I know some of their affiliations: Mizell Stewart is with Gannett/USA Today, Yolanda Martinez is from The Dallas Morning News, Tracie Powell is founder of AllDigitocracy, and Mark Rochester's affiliation isn't clear, so it'll stay null.

The conference is clearly stated as the 2018 IRE CAR conference in Chicago, so the conference key will be "IRE" since that's one of the allowed values. The year is obviously 2018, so that's straightforward.

The title should reflect the content; the original mentions "10 steps to achieve greater diversity among investigative journalists," which I'll use as the title.

For the description, it needs to be a concise summary in simple language. The tipsheet provides actionable strategies for news organizations to diversify their investigative teams, so I'll phrase that clearly.

Keywords are next. They should be no more than five terms excluding conference and authors. Thinking about the content: diversity, investigative journalism, recruitment, inclusion, and talent development seem appropriate.

I also need to ensure all values are in English unless specified otherwise, which they are here. Each key and value must be enclosed in quotes as per JSON standards.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part carefully, making sure not to include any markdown formatting and keep everything properly quoted.
