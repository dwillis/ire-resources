Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE). Let me go through each step carefully.

First, looking at the tipsheet number: it's 3410. That will be the "id" in the JSON.

Next, I see two authors mentioned at the end of the document: Russ Baker and Gordon Witkin. Each has an email and affiliation. So for the "authors" array, each entry should have their name, email, and affiliation. Russ is from WhoWhatWhy.com, so his affiliation is that. Gordon is with the Center for Public Integrity.

The conference location is Las Vegas, but IRE conferences are typically referred to as just "IRE", so the "conference" key will be "IRE". The year is clearly stated as 2010.

The title of the tipsheet is "Investigating Political Influence". For the description, it's a one to two-sentence summary. It should mention strategies for covering influence at agencies, including questions and resources.

Now, keywords. I need up to five terms excluding conference and authors. The main topics here are political influence, regulatory agencies, revolving door, campaign finance, and lobbying.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, making sure each field is properly quoted and formatted.

```json
{
  "id": "3410",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Russ Baker",
      "email": "russ@whowhatwhy.com",
      "affiliation": "WhoWhatWhy.com"
    },
    {
      "name": "Gordon Witkin",
      "email": "gwitkin@publicintegrity.org",
      "affiliation": "Center for Public Integrity"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "2010",
  "title": "Investigating Political Influence",
  "description": "A tipsheet providing strategies and considerations for investigating political influence at regulatory agencies, including questions to ask and resources for research.",
  "keywords": [
    "political influence",
    "regulatory agencies",
    "revolving door",
    "campaign finance",
    "lobbying"
  ]
}
```
