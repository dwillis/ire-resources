Alright, I need to create a JSON object from the provided tipsheet for the NICAR 2005 Conference. Let's break down each key step by step.

First, the id is given as T2357. Thatâ€™s straightforward.

Next, authors. The text mentions Ziva Branstetter as the Projects Editor at Tulsa World. So her name isn't null. Her email and affiliation: since she's affiliated with Tulsa World, that will be her affiliation. No email provided, so it remains null.

Conference is NICAR because the tip sheet is from the NICAR 2005 Conference.

Year is clearly stated as 2005 in the title, so year should be 2005.

Title is "Sex offenders in long-term care facilities."

Description needs to be a concise summary. The story is about matching databases to identify sex offenders in care facilities and verifying their presence through court files and facility calls. So I'll phrase that into one or two sentences.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking at the text, relevant keywords could be "sex offenders," "long-term care facilities," "database matching," "investigative reporting," and "public safety."

Now, putting it all together in JSON format with proper quotation marks and structure.

  "description": "This tipsheet discusses how to investigate and report on the presence of sex offenders in long-term care facilities by matching databases and verifying addresses. It provides guidance on data standardization, address matching techniques, and verification processes.",
