Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has provided specific instructions on the structure and content of the JSON.

First, the id is T2732 as specified. Next, for the authors section, there's only one author mentioned: Vivienne Walt from Time Magazine. Her email is provided, so I'll include that along with her affiliation.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that goes in the conference field. The year isn't mentioned anywhere, so it should be "Not Listed".

For the title, it's "Women Journalists Doing International Investigations". The description needs to be a concise summary of the tipsheet content. It focuses on challenges women face while reporting internationally, especially in Muslim regions.

Keywords are next. I need up to five relevant terms: international investigations, women journalists, Muslim communities, investigative reporting techniques, safety precautions.

I should make sure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, check that the JSON structure is correct with commas separating each key-value pair and proper braces.
