Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided specific instructions on how to structure this JSON, with certain keys like id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, I'll start by identifying each required key. The id is given as 5529, so that's straightforward. Next, the authors section needs to be a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the tipsheet, Norberto Santana Jr. is listed with his contact info: he's affiliated with Voice of OC, and his email is nsantana@voiceofoc.org. There are no other authors mentioned, so that's all for the authors list.

The conference is clearly IRE since it mentions "Board Member, IRE" in the contacts. The year isn't provided anywhere in the text, so I'll set it to "Not Listed". The title of the tipsheet is "Digging Into Public Records: How to make government actually work FOR YOU!".

For the description, I need a 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet covers strategies for accessing public records, dealing with delays and fees, persistence in document requests, etc. So, I'll craft a concise summary that captures these elements without going into too much detail.

Keywords are next. They should be no more than five terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords might include "public records", "FOIA", "PRA", "document discovery", and "government transparency".

I have to make sure all values are in English since the original text is in English, and ensure that everything is properly enclosed in quotes as per JSON standards.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each key with its corresponding value, making sure the authors list correctly includes Norberto's details. Since there are no other authors, the list only has one entry. The description is a clear summary, and keywords are selected to represent the main topics covered.

I think that covers everything. Now, I can write out the JSON object as specified.

    }
  ],
