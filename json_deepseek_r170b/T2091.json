Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an IRE conference. Let me start by understanding the structure and content of the input.

First, the tipsheet is titled "Deadline CAR / IRE 2004 conference" presented by Ziva Branstetter. The main sections are general tips for handling databases, specific database resources, and information about what's on the Tulsa Worldâ€™s intranet using Uniquery. 

The user wants a JSON object with keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

- **id**: Given as T2091.
- **authors**: Ziva Branstetter is listed with her contact info and affiliation. So the author object will have name "Ziva Branstetter", email "ziva.branstetter@tulsaworld.com", and affiliation "Tulsa World Projects Editor".
- **conference**: Since it's from an IRE conference, this should be "IRE".
- **year**: The year is clearly 2004.
- **title**: The title is "Deadline CAR / IRE 2004 conference".
- **description**: Need a concise summary. The tipsheet provides advice on managing databases for investigative journalism, including data gathering, resources, and tools like Uniquery. So maybe something like: "A tipsheet providing advice on managing databases for investigative reporting, including data acquisition strategies, resource lists, and tool recommendations."
- **keywords**: Should include relevant terms from the content without including the conference or authors. Looking at the sections, keywords could be "databases", "investigative journalism", "data management", "Uniquery", "journalism resources".

Now I'll structure all these into a JSON object.

```json
{
  "id": "T2091",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Ziva Branstetter",
      "email": "ziva.branstetter@tulsaworld.com",
      "affiliation": "Tulsa World Projects Editor"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2004,
  "title": "Deadline CAR / IRE 2004 conference",
  "description": "A tipsheet providing advice on managing databases for investigative reporting, including data acquisition strategies, resource lists, and tool recommendations.",
  "keywords": [
    "databases",
    "investigative journalism",
    "data management",
    "Uniquery",
    "journalism resources"
  ]
}
```
