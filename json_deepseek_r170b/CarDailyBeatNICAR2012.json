Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, the id is straightforward: "CarDailyBeatNICAR2012". 

Next, for authors, there's only one author mentioned, Kate Martin. Her email is katie.martin.13@gmail.com and she works at Skagit Valley Herald. So the authors list will have one object with her details.

The conference was held in St. Louis, MO, so I'll set conference to "NICAR". The year is 2012 as given.

The title of the session is "Integrating CAR into a daily beat".

For the description, it's a 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet talks about using computer-assisted reporting in daily beats by gathering and analyzing public records like salaries and 911 calls, so I'll condense that into two sentences.

Keywords should be relevant terms from the content but exclude conference names and authors. Keywords here would include "computer-assisted reporting", "public records", "salary databases", "data analysis", and "investigative journalism".

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly quoted. Also, no made-up information; only what's provided.

Now, putting it all together into the JSON structure as specified.
