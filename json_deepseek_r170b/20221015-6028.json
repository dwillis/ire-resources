Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided specific instructions about what each key should contain. Let me go through this step by step.

First, I'll identify the id which is given as 6028. That's straightforward.

Next, the authors section. Looking at the input, there are three people mentioned: Kameel Stanley, Chip Brantley, and Ike Sriskandarajah. Each has an email and an affiliation. For Kameel, the affiliation is USA TODAY, and the email is kmsjourno@gmail.com. Chip's affiliation is the University of Alabama with chip.brantley@gmail.com. Ike is from Reveal at the Center for Investigative Reporting, and his email is ike@revealnews.org.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE 2020 - Virtual, so the conference key will be "IRE" and the year is 2020.

For the title, it's "The Shape of a Sonic Series - Tip Sheet".

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet offers advice on creating effective podcast series from investigative reports, emphasizing storytelling techniques like prioritizing people over data and organizing recordings.

Keywords should capture the essence without including the conference or authors. I'll choose terms like "investigative reporting", "podcast production", "storytelling techniques", "audio journalism", and "FOIA audio".

Putting it all together, each section is filled out as per the instructions. Double-checking to ensure no made-up names are used; all affiliations are correctly noted where possible.
