Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the ID is straightforward: it's 3385 as provided in the input.

Next, looking at the authors section. The text lists two people: Greg Borowski with his email and affiliation as Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, and Suki Dardarian from The Seattle Times. I should structure each author with name, email, and affiliation fields. Both have their emails and affiliations listed, so those are easy to fill in.

The conference is clearly stated as the 2010 IRE Convention in Las Vegas, so the conference key will be "IRE" and the year is 2010.

For the title, it's given at the top: "INVESTIGATIVE BREAKING NEWS TIPSHEET".

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about strategies for handling breaking news in investigative reporting, covering preparation, execution, and follow-up. So I'll condense that into one or two sentences.

Keywords should be up to five relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking at the content, "investigative journalism", "breaking news", "reporting strategies", "newsroom preparation", and "social media" seem appropriate.

Putting it all together, I structure each key with the correct values, ensuring that everything is in English and properly enclosed in quotes.
