Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given input. Let's start by identifying each required key.

The id is given as 3963, so thatâ€™s straightforward.

Next, authors: Looking at the text, there are several mentions like Jennifer S. Forsyth from The Wall Street Journal and Michael Berens from The Seattle Times. I'll list them with their names and affiliations. Since emails aren't provided, they'll be null.

Conference is clearly stated as IRE 2013, so conference is "IRE" and year is 2013.

Title should capture the main topic. The input starts with "Writing the Investigative Story: Some Insights from the Judges," which seems appropriate.

Description needs a concise summary. The text discusses tips for writing investigative stories, emphasizing clarity, conciseness, and effective use of data. So, I'll write that it provides insights on writing techniques focusing on those aspects.

Keywords should be relevant and not exceed five. The main themes are Investigative Reporting, Story Writing, Data Journalism, Editing, and FOIA, which are all covered in the text.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly quoted. Also, make sure that if any information isn't present, like emails, they remain null.
