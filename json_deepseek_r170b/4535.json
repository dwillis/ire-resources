Okay, so I need to create a JSON object from the input provided. The user has given me specific instructions on what each key should contain. Let's break this down step by step.

First, looking at the input, it's a set of guidelines for creating human rights stories. There are tips on using narrative techniques, informed consent, and some useful links at the end. The document doesn't mention any authors, so I'll have to leave that as null.

The id is given as 4535, so that part is straightforward. Next, authors should be a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. Since no names are listed, each author object will have name set to null, and email and affiliation can also be null because there's no information provided about them.

The conference key needs to be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". The input doesn't mention any conference, so I'll default to "Not Listed". Similarly, the year isn't specified anywhere in the text, so that will also be "Not Listed".

For the title, I need a concise one that reflects the content. The document is about guidelines for human rights stories, so something like "Guidelines for Human Rights Storytelling" seems appropriate.

The description should be a 1-2 sentence summary. The input talks about using narrative techniques and informed consent, so summarizing that into simple language would work.

Keywords are next. I need up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords could be "human rights", "storytelling", "narrative techniques", "informed consent", and "journalism guidelines".

Putting it all together, each key is addressed based on the input provided. Since there's no author information or conference details, those fields are appropriately set to null or "Not Listed".

  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,

      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Guidelines for Human Rights Storytelling",
  "description": "A guide on creating human rights stories using various narrative techniques, informed consent, and documentation.",
  "keywords": [
    "human rights",
    "storytelling",
    "narrative techniques",
    "informed consent",
    "journalism guidelines"
