Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, looking at the input, it's in Spanish but seems to be about TV narrative techniques for investigative reporting. The ID is 2729 as per the translation. The author section lists David Schechter from WCCO-TV with his contact info. So I'll need to structure the authors array accordingly, making sure each entry has name, email, and affiliation.

The conference mentioned is IRE in Fort Worth on June 16, 2006, so conference is "IRE" and year is 2006. The title in English would be something like "TV Narrative: Finding the Right Tone and Style." 

For the description, it should be a concise summary of the tipsheet's content, maybe focusing on how it helps journalists find the right tone and style for TV investigations.

Keywords should include terms related to investigative journalism techniques, narrative, tone, storytelling, and promotion since those are central themes in the tipsheet.

I also need to ensure all values are in English unless the original text isn't. The authors' details are clear, so I can fill those without issues. Making sure not to invent any names or affiliations if they aren't present.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each key as specified, ensuring proper syntax and that everything is enclosed in quotes.
