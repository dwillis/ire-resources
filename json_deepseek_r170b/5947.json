Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given query and tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conferences. Let me start by understanding what's required.

The user provided specific instructions: they want a response that is only a JSON object with certain keys—id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id should be 5947, which is straightforward.

Looking at the input, the tipsheet is titled "Connect the Dots – From Data and Documents to People" by Michael J. Berens from Reuters, presented at IRE 2019. So, under authors, I'll need a list where each entry has name, email, and affiliation. Since only Michael's name and affiliation are given, his email will be null.

The conference is clearly IRE, so that key is set. The year is specified as 2019. The title should exactly match the provided one. For the description, it needs to be a concise summary of 1-2 sentences in simple English. It should explain how data and documents help find human stories for investigative pieces.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the content, suitable keywords could be "investigative journalism," "data analysis," "storytelling techniques," "documentary research," and "public records."

Now, putting it all together in JSON format with proper enclosures and structure.
