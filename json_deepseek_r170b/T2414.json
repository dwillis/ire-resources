Okay, so I'm trying to help create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has provided specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, the ID is straightforward: it's T2414 as specified.

Next, for the authors section, there's only one author mentioned: Duff Wilson from The New York Times. His email and phone number are given, so I'll include those. Since his affiliation isn't explicitly stated next to his name but it's clear he works for The New York Times, that will be his affiliation.

The conference is IRE, happening in Denver in 2005, so the year is 2005.

The title of the session is "Authenticity: Investigating tipsters, bloggers, and Web sites."

For the description, it should be a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about verifying sources like tipsters by using various methods and tools, so I'll summarize that into one or two sentences.

Keywords need to be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking at the content, keywords could include "authenticity," "investigative journalism," "source verification," "public records," and "credibility."

Putting it all together, each key is filled with the appropriate information as per the instructions.
