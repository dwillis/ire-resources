Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. They provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The id should be 3822. 

First, looking at authors: Marcel Dufresne is listed with his email and affiliation as University of Connecticut. So I'll set authors as an array with one object containing name, email, and affiliation.

The conference is clearly IRE 2012, so the year is 2012.

For the title, it's "Doing Student Investigations with Class."

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet is about teaching investigative journalism to students, including planning and strategies for successful projects.

Keywords should include relevant terms like student investigations, undergraduate education, media partnerships, etc., but limited to five.

Putting it all together, ensuring each key is correctly formatted as per the instructions.
