Okay, I'm trying to create a JSON object based on the user's instructions. The input provided seems to be from an IRE (Investigative Reporters and Editors) conference with various sessions and speakers. My task is to parse this information correctly.

First, I need to extract the relevant data points: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The id should be "4486_edit" as specified. 

Next, for authors, I have to list each author with their name, email, and affiliation. If any of these details are missing, they should be null. Looking through the text, there's a mention of Bernice Yeung from Reveal/CIR. So her name is Bernice Yeung, email is byeung@cironline.org, and affiliation is "Reveal / The Center for Investigative Reporting". I don't see other authors mentioned with enough details, so they can be omitted or set to null.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE. 

The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the text provided, so it should default to "Not Listed".

For the title, the main topic seems to be about pesticides use, specifically related to strawberry growers and their reliance on fumigants like methyl bromide and 1,3-D.

The description needs to be a concise summary. It should mention the investigation into California strawberry growers' heavy pesticide use, the health risks involved, and regulatory issues.

Keywords should include terms like "pesticides", "fumigants", "strawberry industry", "health risks", and "regulatory issues" â€“ making sure not to exceed five keywords.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, no made-up names or data; only extract what's present.
