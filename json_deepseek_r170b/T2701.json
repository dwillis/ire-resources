Alright, so I need to create a JSON object from the given input with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is T2701. 

First, looking at the text, it's about the Abramoff investigation by The Washington Post. Authors mentioned are James Grimaldi and Jeff Leen. Their emails and affiliations aren't provided, so I'll leave those as null. Since they're from The Washington Post, that will be their affiliation.

The conference isn't explicitly mentioned, but since the text refers to IRE (Investigative Reporters and Editors), I'll set conference to "IRE". The year isn't clearly stated, so it's "Not Listed".

For the title, the main topic is the Abramoff investigation, so I'll use that. The description needs a 1-2 sentence summary: It's about journalists using tools like wikis and social network analysis in their investigation.

Keywords should be up to five terms: "investigative journalism", "social network analysis", "wiki", "Abramoff scandal", "Washington Post".

Putting it all together, I structure the JSON accordingly.

```json
{
  "id": "T2701",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "James Grimaldi",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Washington Post"
    },
    {
      "name": "Jeff Leen",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Washington Post"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigation into Abramoff Scandal",
  "description": "Journalists discuss their investigative methods and tools used in uncovering the Abramoff scandal, including social network analysis and collaborative software.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative journalism",
    "social network analysis",
    "wiki",
    "Abramoff scandal",
    "Washington Post"
  ]
}
```
