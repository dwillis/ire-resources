Alright, I need to help the user create a JSON object based on their detailed query. They provided specific instructions about the structure of the JSON and the data it should contain. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, the JSON must have keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 3520. The authors are to be listed with name, email, and affiliation. If any of these aren't provided, I should leave them as null. Meg Kissinger's details are there, so her entry will have all fields filled.

Next, the conference location is either IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed. Since the input doesn't specify where the conference was held, it'll be "Not Listed". The year isn't mentioned either, so that field remains "Not Listed" as well.

The title comes from the tipsheet provided: "Tips for Investigating Caregivers". I need to write a concise description summarizing the content. It should mention strategies like reviewing legal notices and overcoming denials by seeking higher authorities or alternative sources.

For keywords, they want up to five terms excluding conference and authors. The main topics here are legal notices, public denial strategies, hospital policies, caregiver oversight, and victim humanization.

I also need to ensure that all values are in English unless the original text is different, which it isn't here. All keys and values must be enclosed in quotes as per JSON standards.

Let me structure this step by step:

1. Start with id: 3520.
2. Authors list includes Meg Kissinger with her email and affiliation.
3. Conference is "Not Listed" since the location isn't specified.
4. Year is also "Not Listed".
5. Title is taken directly from the tipsheet title.
6. Description should be a clear, brief summary of the tips provided.
7. Keywords are selected based on the main points discussed.

I think that covers all the requirements. Now I can put it all together into the JSON format as specified.
