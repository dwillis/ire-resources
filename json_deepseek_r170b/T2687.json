Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given input. The user has provided specific instructions for each key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the id is straightforward; it's T2687 as specified.

Next, authors. Looking at the input, there's Maud Beelman listed with her email and affiliation to The Dallas Morning News. So I'll create an object for her with name, email, and affiliation filled in. There are no other authors mentioned, so that's the only one.

The conference is clearly stated as the 2006 IRE National Conference in Fort Worth. So the conference key will be "IRE".

For the year, it's given as 2006, so that goes into the year field.

The title of the tipsheet is “Women journalists doing international investigations”, which I'll enclose in quotes.

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The main points from Maud Beelman's tips include understanding local customs, finding a sherpa or guide, leveraging being a woman in certain situations, and collaborating with other journalists internationally. So I'll condense that into 1-2 sentences.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords are international investigations, women journalists, cross-border collaboration, local customs, and investigative reporting.

I need to ensure all keys and values are in English and properly quoted. Also, check that there are no made-up names; Maud Beelman is the only author mentioned, so others aren't included.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON accordingly.
