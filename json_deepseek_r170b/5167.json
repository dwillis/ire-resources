Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an IRE conference. Let's break down each part.

First, the id is provided as 5167. That's straightforward.

Looking for authors: The tipsheet mentions Francisco Vara-Orta from Education Week and EWA. So, the author's name is "Francisco Vara-Orta". No email or affiliation beyond his organization, so I'll set those to null accordingly.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE 2017 in Phoenix, so conference is "IRE" and year is 2017. The title of the tipsheet is "Watchdogging K-12 Education".

For the description, it should be a concise summary. The tipsheet provides strategies for journalists covering education beats, emphasizing trust-building, source training, data use, etc. So, I'll summarize that into one or two sentences.

Keywords are next. I need up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking at the content: "K-12 Education", "Investigative Journalism", "Education Reporting", "Watchdog Journalism", "Public Records". These capture the essence without overlapping with other sections.

I should ensure all values are in English, keys are properly quoted, and the structure is correct. Double-checking for any made-up names or incorrect affiliationsâ€”everything here seems accurate based on the input.

Finally, I'll assemble everything into a JSON object following the specified format.
