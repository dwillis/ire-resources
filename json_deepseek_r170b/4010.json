Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, looking at the content, it's about web searching strategies for journalists. The author mentioned is Doug Haddix from the Kiplinger Program at Ohio State University. Since there are no other authors listed, I'll create an array with just his details. His email isn't provided, so that will be null.

The conference isn't explicitly stated as IRE or NICAR in the text, but since it's about investigative reporters and includes a tipsheet typical of such conferences, I think "IRE" is appropriate here. The year isn't mentioned anywhere in the document, so it should be "Not Listed".

For the title, the main heading is "Web for watchdogs," which seems to capture the essence of the content. The description needs to be concise, summarizing the tipsheet's focus on advanced search techniques and tools for journalists.

Keywords are next. I'll extract relevant terms like "web searching", "investigative journalism", "Google search", "deep web", and "search engines" as they represent the main topics covered without including the conference name or author.

I should ensure all values are in English and correctly enclosed in quotes, with proper JSON syntax.
