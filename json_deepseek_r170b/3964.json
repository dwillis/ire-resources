Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me start by identifying each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The ID is provided as 3964. So that's straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors section. The tipsheet mentions Steve Proctor from the Houston Chronicle. His name is there, but no email or affiliation beyond the news organization. Since his affiliation is clearly stated as Managing Editor at the Houston Chronicle, I can use that for the affiliation field. However, since the example provided in the user's query only includes 'name', 'email', and 'affiliation', I should structure it accordingly, leaving email null because it's not provided.

The conference is specified as IRE 2013, so conference will be "IRE" and year will be 2013.

For the title, the tipsheet is titled "The Metal Men: Lessons for Writers".

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The main points of the tipsheet include lessons on storytelling, such as witnessing action, telling stories in scenes with specific goals, and the link between detailed reporting and powerful writing. So I can summarize that the tipsheet provides storytelling lessons emphasizing detailed reporting and scene-based narratives.

Keywords should exclude the conference and authors but include relevant terms like storytelling, scenes, editing, journalism, and reporting.

I need to ensure all values are in English and enclosed in quotes, with proper JSON formatting. Also, since this is a response for an IRE conference, the conference key will be "IRE", not another option.
