Okay, so I need to help the user create a JSON object based on their query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) tipsheet. Let me read through their request carefully.

First, they provided a tipsheet titled "Covering threats against journalists overseas without leaving town" by Courtney Mabeus. The content includes bullet points on initial research, friends lists, hashtags, language barriers, starting conversations, and challenges to consider.

They want a JSON response with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 4512. Authors should be a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. They mention not to make up names and leave them null if none are listed. Also, use the news organization as affiliation if possible.

Looking at the tipsheet, Courtney Mabeus is the author. There's no email or affiliation provided, so those will be null. The conference isn't explicitly mentioned but since it's from IRE, I'll put "IRE" for the conference. The year isn't listed, so it remains "Not Listed".

For the title, it's straightforward: "Covering threats against journalists overseas without leaving town". The description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. I should capture the main idea about using social media to investigate threats against journalists without direct access.

Keywords are up to five terms, excluding conference and authors. So, "social media", "investigative journalism", "journalist safety", "online research", and "international reporting" seem appropriate.

Now, putting it all together into a JSON structure with the specified keys and values. Make sure everything is in English and properly quoted.
