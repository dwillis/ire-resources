Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's input. The tipsheet provided has three main sections: Custom Training, Research Desk, and Custom Data Analysis & Visualization. 

First, the id is given as 5835. The title seems to be about bolstering watchdog work through hiring IRE for custom training. So I'll set the title accordingly.

For authors, there are specific contacts mentioned: Denise Malan, Lauren Grandestaff, and Charles Minshew. Each has their name, email, and affiliation with IRE. I need to list them as an array of objects with these attributes.

The conference is clearly IRE since all sections mention IRE services. The year isn't provided in the text, so it should be "Not Listed".

The description needs to be a concise summary. It's about the three main offerings: custom training, research assistance, and data analysis. I'll phrase that into one or two sentences.

Keywords are limited to five, excluding conference and authors. So I'll pick relevant terms like Custom Training, Research Desk, Data Analysis, Investigative Reporting, and Nonprofit. 

I should ensure all keys are in quotes and values are correctly formatted. No markdown, just plain JSON.
