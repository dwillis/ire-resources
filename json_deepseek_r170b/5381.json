Alright, I'm trying to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from NICAR18. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id should be 5381 as specified. Next, looking at the authors section. The tipsheet mentions Aditi Bhandari and Madi Alexander with their emails. Their names aren't null, so I'll include them. Since they're listed under "Want us to add something," I can assume their affiliation is from their emails or roles, but there's no explicit news organization mentioned, so I'll leave affiliation as null for both.

The conference is clearly NICAR because it's titled NICAR18 Early Career Straight-Talk Tipsheet. The year isn't explicitly stated in the text, so I'll set that to "Not Listed."

For the title, it's given as "NICAR18 Early Career Straight-Talk Tipsheet." The description should be a concise summary. Looking at the content, the tipsheet provides resources for early-career journalists, including Slack groups, Facebook groups, professional organizations, job boards, fellowships, workshops, and mentors.

Now, the keywords. I need to pick up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, relevant terms are "Slack groups," "Facebook groups," "professional organizations," "journalism resources." That's four, so I can stop there or add one more if needed, but these seem sufficient.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part as per the JSON format, ensuring all keys and values are enclosed in quotes. Double-checking to make sure emails are correct and that I didn't miss any affiliations. Also, making sure not to include any extra information beyond what's specified.
