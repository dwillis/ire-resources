Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through this step by step.

First, the id is provided as 4503, that's straightforward.

Next, the authors are Samantha Sunne and Matt Wynn. The user mentioned not to make up any names and leave fields null if not present. I don't have their emails or affiliations in the text, so those will be null.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE 2015 in Philadelphia, so the conference key is "IRE" and the year is 2015.

For the title, it's "Getting data from the web: From the quick grab to the intricate scrape."

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about various methods of scraping data, using tools, and some scripting libraries in Python. So I can summarize that as: "This tipsheet covers methods for extracting data from websites, including manual techniques, point-and-click tools, and scripting with Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and Requests."

Keywords should be relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. The main topics are web scraping, data extraction, APIs, automation, and Python.

Putting it all together, I structure each key accordingly, ensuring that all values are in quotes and proper JSON formatting is followed.

```json

  "id": 4503,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Samantha Sunne",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    },
    {
      "name": "Matt Wynn",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2015,
  "title": "Getting data from the web: From the quick grab to the intricate scrape",
  "description": "This tipsheet covers methods for extracting data from websites, including manual techniques, point-and-click tools, and scripting with Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and Requests.",
  "keywords": [
