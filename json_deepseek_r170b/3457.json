Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE). The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, let's identify the id, which is straightforwardâ€”tipsheet #3457. So, "id": 3457.

Next are the authors. There are two speakers: Derek Willis from The New York Times and Anthony DeBarros from USA TODAY. Each author entry needs a name, email, and affiliation. Since emails aren't provided, they'll be null. Affiliations are clear from their titles, so I can fill those in.

The conference is IRE CAR in Raleigh, N.C., 2011. So the conference key will be "IRE" as per the options given. The year is clearly listed as 2011.

For the title, it's "APIs: Making the Web a Data Medium."

The description needs to be a concise summary of the tipsheet. It discusses how APIs allow programs to access data and services, their importance for journalists in making content portable, reducing data rot, and potential business benefits.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking through the content, relevant keywords are "APIs," "data journalism," "journalism tools," "web services," and "newsroom technology."

Putting it all together, I structure each key with appropriate values, ensuring that emails and any missing info are set to null.
