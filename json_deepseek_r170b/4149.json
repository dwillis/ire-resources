Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. First, I'll parse the input provided.

The input consists of several tips for moderators at conferences. Each tip is bulleted but in encoded text, likely from a scan or OCR. My first step is to decode these points into readable English.

Looking at each bullet point:

- Ensure panelists are prepared with best practices.
- Confirm panelists have necessary materials like PowerPoint links or websites beforehand to avoid technical issues.
- Send an email confirming roles before the session.
- Meet in person to ensure no last-minute changes and identify new talking points.
- Check that equipment works; know the room monitor's name for assistance.
- Start on time to not inconvenience attendees who arrive punctually.
- Inform attendees there will be time for Q&A so panelists can present without interruptions.
- Allocate equal time for each presenter, with a warning when they have 5 minutes left.
- Don't interrupt panelists; the moderator should keep the flow going and ensure attendees' experience is good.
- Leave 15-30 minutes for Q&A, reminding attendees to identify themselves clearly as sessions are recorded.
- Remind questioners to be concise and avoid sharing their own stories, focusing on getting as many questions as possible.
- End on time, thank everyone, and exit so the next panel can start promptly.

From these points, I can summarize that this tipsheet is about best practices for moderators at conferences, particularly those organized by IRE. The description should capture this essence succinctly.

Next, assigning values to each key in the JSON:

- **id**: 4149 as specified.
- **authors**: Since no specific authors are mentioned, the list will have nulls for names, emails, and affiliations.
- **conference**: Clearly "IRE" since it's about their conference.
- **year**: Not listed, so value is "Not Listed".
- **title**: Derived from the content, likely "Tipsheet for Moderators at IRE Conferences".
- **description**: A 1-2 sentence summary of the tips provided.
- **keywords**: Relevant terms like "moderation", "conference", "best practices", etc., but excluding "IRE" and author-related terms.

I need to ensure all values are in English, keys are enclosed in quotes, and the structure is correct. I'll avoid making up any information not present in the input.
