Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a detailed tipsheet from an IRE conference titled "Changing Climate, Changing Weather" by Christy George, Jeff Burnside, and Tony Davis. They want me to convert this into a specific JSON object with certain keys.

First, I'll need to parse the input thoroughly. The main goal is to extract all relevant information and map it onto the required JSON structure. Let's start by identifying each section of the tipsheet:

1. **Authors**: There are three authors listedâ€”Christy George, Jeff Burnside, and Tony Davis. However, their emails and affiliations aren't provided in the text. Since the user mentioned not to make up any information, I'll set email and affiliation to null for each author.

2. **Conference**: The tipsheet mentions it's from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference, so the conference key will be "IRE".

3. **Year**: The input doesn't specify the year of the event, so according to the instructions, I'll set this to "Not Listed".

4. **Title**: Clearly given as "Changing Climate, Changing Weather".

5. **Description**: Needs to be a concise 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. The tipsheet covers various resources and examples for reporting on climate change impacts, so I can summarize it accordingly.

6. **Keywords**: These should be no more than five terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking at the content, keywords like "climate change", "weather extremes", "environmental reporting", "scientific data", and "local impacts" are appropriate.

Now, considering each part:

- The description must capture the essence without being too detailed. I'll mention the provision of resources and specific examples to help journalists cover climate stories effectively.

- For keywords, ensuring they're relevant and concise is important. They should encapsulate the main themes of the tipsheet.

I also need to make sure that all values are in English and enclosed within quotation marks as per JSON standards. Since there's no made-up information and all data is extracted directly from the input, this adheres to the user's instructions.

Finally, structuring everything into a JSON object with the specified keys, ensuring correct syntax and proper nesting for authors. I'll double-check each field to make sure nothing is missed or incorrectly formatted.
