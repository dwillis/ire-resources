Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given instructions. Let's break down what the user has provided.

First, they mentioned movement.uber.com, a free public website using Uberâ€™s data to help cities with transportation decisions. The description is about how this tool offers travel times by hour over time but isn't real-time or about Uber itself. It also includes when it will shut down and examples of usage comparisons.

The user wants a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. 

ID should be 5070. Authors are a list where each has name, email, and affiliation. Since no names are provided, I'll leave them as null. Conference is "Not Listed" because it's not clear which one this is from. Year is also "Not Listed". The title can be something like "Movement.Uber.Com: A Tool for Data-Driven Transportation Planning."

Description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary. So, I'll mention the website and its purpose, noting that it's not real-time or about Uber.

Keywords should include up to five terms: transportation planning, data-driven policy, urban mobility, traffic analysis, public data tool.

I need to make sure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. No made-up names for authors, so they stay null.

    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Movement.Uber.Com: A Tool for Data-Driven Transportation Planning",
  "description": "A free, public website using Uber's data to help cities make informed transportation policy and planning decisions. It provides historical travel time data but is not real-time or specific to Uber operations.",
  "keywords": [
    "transportation planning",
    "data-driven policy",
    "urban mobility",
