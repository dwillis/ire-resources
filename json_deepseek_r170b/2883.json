Alright, I need to figure out how to create this JSON object based on the user's query. Let me break down what they asked for.

First, the input seems to be from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The id given is 2883, so that's straightforward. 

Looking at the authors section, I see David Wethe listed with his email and affiliation as the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. Since there are no other authors mentioned, the list will only have him.

The conference is clearly labeled as "IRE", so that key is set. The year isn't provided in the input, so I'll default to "Not Listed".

For the title, it's "Lo básico de las investigaciones de empresas" which translates to "The Basics of Company Investigations". The description needs to be a concise summary. I'll write something about essential resources and techniques for investigating companies.

Keywords should be relevant terms from the content. The main points cover SEC reports, business registration, public records, and government filings, so those will be my keywords.

I need to ensure all fields are in English except when the original text isn't. Here, everything is in Spanish but the JSON keys and values should be in English as per instructions.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each key properly with the correct data types. No made-up names or extra info—just what's provided.
