Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from Brian Maass about protecting and cultivating sources. The user has specific instructions, so I'll follow them step by step.

First, I notice that each tipsheet should have an id. Here it's T2231. Next, the authors section is a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. Brian Maass is listed as the author from KCNC-TV in Denver, and his email is provided. So, I'll include all that information.

The conference isn't explicitly mentioned, so according to instructions, it should be "Not Listed". The year is also not given, so I'll mark that as "Not Listed" too. 

For the title, it's clearly stated as 'Protecting and Cultivating Sources'. The description needs to be a concise summary. I'll focus on the main points about protecting sources from repercussions and cultivating them through trust and accessibility.

Keywords should be relevant and no more than five. I'll choose "source protection", "investigative journalism", "confidentiality", "ethics", and "journalism sources" as they cover the key aspects of the tipsheet.

I also need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Since there's no made-up data, everything should be accurate based on the input.
