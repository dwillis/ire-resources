Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on this tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me start by reading through the provided content carefully.

First, I notice that the tipsheet includes contact information for two people: Jaimi Dowdell and Mark Horvit. Both are affiliated with IRE, as indicated by their emails, which have the domain @ire.org. Their names are clearly stated, so I'll include them in the authors array with their respective details.

Next, looking at the content itself, it's all about using U.S. data sources for international reporting. The tipsheet provides various resources like the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), specific government websites such as FPDS and FDA import refusal data, and mentions tools like FOIA Machine and Panjiva. These are all methods to gather information relevant to journalists working internationally.

I need to summarize this in a concise description. Something like: "Tips for using U.S. data sources to investigate international stories." That should capture the essence without being too lengthy.

Now, for keywords. I'll extract terms that represent the main topics here. FOIA, Federal Contracts, FDA Import Refusal Data, Panjiva, and International Reporting seem appropriate. Theyâ€™re all central themes in the tipsheet.

The conference is clearly an IRE event since both authors are from IRE, so the conference key will be "IRE". However, the year isn't mentioned anywhere in the text, so I'll set that to "Not Listed".

Putting it all together, I structure the JSON with id 4899 as specified. The authors array includes Jaimi and Mark with their emails and affiliations. The title is derived from the main topic, and the description is a brief summary.

I should double-check if there are any other details I might have missed, but it seems like I've covered all necessary parts: contacts, resources mentioned, and key points for the JSON structure.

    {
      "name": null,

    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Using U.S. Data Sources for International Investigations",
  "description": "A tipsheet providing resources and methods for accessing international information through U.S. data sources, including FOIA requests and federal databases.",
  "keywords": [
    "FOIA",
    "Federal Contracts",
    "FDA Import Refusal Data",
