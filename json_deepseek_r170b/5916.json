Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I look for the `id`, which is given as 5916. That's straightforward.

Next, under `authors`, there's Kae M. Petrin listed with her email and affiliation to St. Louis Public Radio. I'll structure this as an array of objects with name, email, and affiliation. Since she's the only author mentioned, that's all for now.

The `conference` is clearly identified as "IRE" since it's from an IRE event.

For the `year`, the tipsheet doesn't specify when the conference took place, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

The `title` should be a concise summary of the content. The tipsheet focuses on investigating property developers, so I'll use that as the title.

The `description` needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. It should capture the essence of the tipsheet, which provides steps and considerations for journalists looking into property development deals.

For `keywords`, I need up to five relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, key areas include "property developers", "tax abatements", "development deals", "FOIA", and "gentrification". These are all central themes in the tipsheet.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part according to these observations.
