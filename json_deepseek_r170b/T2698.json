Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, the structure of the JSON is specified with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. Each key has specific requirements. The id should be T2698 as given. 

Looking at the 'authors' section, it's a list where each element has name, email, and affiliation. The user mentioned not to make up names and leave them null if not provided. In the input text, I see "By [name]" which is redacted, so I'll set name to null. There's an email mentioned: "pfichtner@kcstar.com". For affiliation, since it's part of a news organization, I should use that as the affiliation if not explicitly stated. Here, the email is from "kcstar.com", which suggests The Kansas City Star, so that will be the affiliation.

The conference is specified as either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". In this case, it's clearly an IRE conference tip, so conference should be "IRE".

For the year, the text says it was presented at the 2006 IRE Conference. So year is 2006.

The title needs to be a brief headline. The original tipsheet is titled "Investigating stockbrokers and brokerage firms", which seems appropriate.

The description must be a concise summary of 1-2 sentences in simple language. The tipsheet talks about using state securities data to investigate brokers, so the description should reflect that approach and its benefits.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords could be "stockbrokers", "securities", "investigation", "data analysis", "brokerage firms".

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part as per the requirements, ensuring correct data types and formatting.
