Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given input with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. Let me start by understanding each part.

First, the id is T2069 as provided. Next, for authors, I see that the text includes "Brant Houston" mentioned multiple times in resources like the "IRE Beat Page," but no email or affiliation is listed next to his name. Since there's a mention of IRE (Investigative Reporters and Editors), that can be his affiliation.

Looking at the content, it's about tools for journalists covering various beats, including government information, legal resources, and news databases. The conference isn't explicitly stated, but since it mentions "IRE" in several places, I'll set conference to "IRE". The year isn't provided, so I'll mark that as "Not Listed".

The title should reflect the content's purpose. It seems to be a guide for journalists, so "Journalistâ€™s Guide to Internet Tools and Resources" fits well.

For description, it needs to be a concise summary. Something like: "A comprehensive resource list for journalists covering various beats, including government information, legal resources, and news databases."

Now, keywords. I need up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords are: "government information", "legal resources", "news databases", "journalism tools", and "investigative reporting".

Putting it all together in JSON format with proper syntax and structure.
