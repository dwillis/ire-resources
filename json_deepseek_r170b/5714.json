Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to create this JSON object based on the user's query. The input provided is about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference panel from 2018 titled "Decoding business & financial documents." The speaker is Aaron Kessler, a CNN senior producer.

First, I need to structure the JSON with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 5714. 

For the authors section, it's a list where each entry has name, email, and affiliation. Aaron Kessler is the speaker, so his name is known. However, the input doesn't provide his email or affiliation beyond CNN. So I'll set his email to null and affiliation to "CNN."

The conference is clearly IRE, and the year is 2018 as mentioned in the panel description.

The title is straightforward from the input: "Decoding business & financial documents." 

Next, the description should be a concise summary of the session. The panel talks about using state and local records, specifically in Florida, covering sources like Secretary of State records, Clerk of Court, Property Appraiser, etc. It also mentions UCC filings and the WARN Act. So I need to encapsulate this into 1-2 sentences.

For keywords, they should be relevant terms from the content but excluding the conference name and authors. So possible keywords are "business records," "financial documents," "investigative journalism," "UCC filings," and "WARN Act."

I have to make sure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. No markdown, just plain JSON.

Let me double-check each field:

- id: 5714 (correct)
- authors: Only Aaron Kessler with his details
- conference: IRE
- year: 2018
- title: Correct as given
- description: Summarizes the key points about using various records and specific filings
- keywords: Five relevant terms

I think that covers everything. Now, putting it all together into a JSON structure without any markdown.
