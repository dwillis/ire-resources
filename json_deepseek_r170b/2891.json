Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided input. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the user's query, they have an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet from 2006 in Fort Worth, Texas. The session title is “Investigaciones Internacionales Hechas por Mujeres” which translates to "International Investigations Done by Women." 

The id given is 2891, so I'll use that as the JSON's id. Next, under authors, there's Maud Beelman listed with her email and affiliation from The Dallas Morning News. Since she's the only author mentioned, the authors array will have one object with her details.

For the conference field, since it's an IRE event, the value is "IRE". The year is clearly 2006, so that goes into the year field. The title is in Spanish, but according to the instructions, all values should be in English unless the original text isn't. However, the session title was presented in Spanish, so it's appropriate to keep it as is.

The description needs to be a concise summary of the content. The tipsheet offers advice for women conducting international investigations, including understanding local customs and finding local guides. So, I'll craft a 1-2 sentence summary that captures this essence.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords would be "international investigations," "women in journalism," "investigative reporting," "cross-border reporting," and "collaboration." These encapsulate the main topics without including the conference name or author details.

Now, putting it all together, I'll structure each key accordingly, ensuring proper formatting with quotes and commas. Each value is enclosed in double quotes, and the JSON is properly nested for the authors array.

I also need to make sure that no information is made up and only what's provided is used. Since the year was clear from the input, there's no ambiguity there. All keys are correctly labeled as per the instructions, so the final JSON should meet all specified requirements.
