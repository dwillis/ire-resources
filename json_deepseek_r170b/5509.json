Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference, specifically marked with @bymarkwalker and the IRE affiliation. They want me to produce a JSON object based on this tipsheet.

First, I need to identify the key components required for the JSON structure: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The user also specified that the id should be 5509, so that's straightforward.

Looking at the authors section, Mark Walker is listed with his email (mark@ire.org) and affiliation as IRE. Since there are no other authors mentioned, this will be the only entry in the authors list.

The conference is clearly identified as IRE, so I'll set that accordingly. The year isn't provided in the text, so it should default to "Not Listed".

For the title, the tipsheet covers web searching and social media for investigators, which makes a suitable title. 

The description needs to be concise, summarizing the content. The tipsheet offers strategies for effective online research, including tools and methods for backgrounding sources, advanced search techniques, and social media sleuthing. So, I'll craft a 1-2 sentence summary that captures these elements.

Keywords should include relevant terms without exceeding five. From the text, "web search", "social media", "investigative journalism", "backgrounding", and "research tools" are appropriate.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. I'll structure each part carefully, making sure not to add any made-up information and handling cases where data isn't available by setting them to null or the default as specified.

Finally, I'll compile everything into a JSON object, ensuring correct syntax and that all fields meet the user's requirements.
