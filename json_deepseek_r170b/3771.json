Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. They provided a detailed tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, the structure: they want keys like id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is 3771 as given. 

Looking at the authors section, I see Brad Guilmino's details. His name is provided along with email and affiliation to HNTB. So that goes into the authors array.

The conference is IRE since it's from their event. Year isn't mentioned in the input, so it should be "Not Listed". The title is clear: "Tolling and Project Development."

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet covers tolling trends, project development, and financing, especially P3 models. So I'll craft that into 1-2 sentences.

Keywords should be relevant terms excluding conference and authors. Tolling, project development, finance, P3, transportation fit well.

I'll structure all this into a JSON object with proper syntax and ensure all values are in English as required.

```json

      "affiliation": "HNTB"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Tolling and Project Development",
  "description": "This tipsheet explores the resurgence of tolling as a funding mechanism for transportation projects, covering trends, financial aspects, and project development processes. It also discusses managed lanes, all-electronic tolling, and public-private partnerships.",
  "keywords": [
    "tolling",
    "project development",
    "finance",
    "P3",
    "transportation"
