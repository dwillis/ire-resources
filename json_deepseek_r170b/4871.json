Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Tawnell D. Hobbs at the 2016 IRE Conference. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, the id is given as 4871, so that's straightforward. Next, for authors, there's only one author mentioned: Tawnell D. Hobbs. Her email and affiliation are both provided, so those go into the authors array.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, and the year is 2016 since it was held in New Orleans that year. The title of the tipsheet is "UNCOVERING STORIES ON THE SCHOOL BEAT".

Now, for the description, I need a concise summary. Looking at the tips, they focus on where to find information and red flags in school districts, so the description should reflect that.

Keywords are next. I'll pick terms like 'school spending', 'education reporting', 'financial oversight', 'public records', and 'investigative journalism'â€”all relevant without including the conference or author names.

Putting it all together, each part is filled out correctly with proper formatting.
