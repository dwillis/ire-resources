Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on how each part should be structured.

First, looking at the content, Megan Luther is the author with her email and affiliation as Raycom Media. So, in the authors array, I'll include her details. There's no other author mentioned, so that's straightforward.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that goes into the conference field. The year isn't explicitly mentioned, so it defaults to "Not Listed". 

For the title, it's about working and managing remotely. The description needs to be a concise summary. I'll note that it covers productivity, challenges, and management tips.

Keywords should include relevant terms like remote work, productivity, management, etc., but not more than five. Excluding 'conference' and 'authors', as instructed.

I need to make sure all keys are in quotes and the structure follows exactly what's asked. No made-up names; since only Megan is listed, others are null.

Putting it all together, I'll format each key properly, ensuring correct syntax and that all requirements from the user are met.
