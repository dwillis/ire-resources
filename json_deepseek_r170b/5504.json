Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on this user's query. Let me read through their instructions carefully.

The input they provided seems like a detailed guide for investigative journalism, specifically about sourcing and building trust with sources. There are various tips on how to approach conferences, use social media, and maintain confidentiality.

First, the id should be 5504 as specified. Next, authors: I notice names mentioned like Sarah Kendzior and others from news organizations like The Washington Post or ProPublica, but in the text provided, there aren't any specific author names listed. So the authors list will have elements with name set to null, and email and affiliation also null.

The conference key should be "Not Listed" because I don't see any mention of a specific conference like IRE or NICAR. Year is also "Not Listed" since there's no date provided in the text.

For the title, it seems appropriate to call it "Investigative Journalism Tips and Tricks." The description needs to be a concise summary. I'll go with something like: "A guide on effective investigative journalism techniques, including sourcing strategies and trust-building methods."

Keywords should include terms like Investigative journalism, Sourcing, Trust-building, Confidentiality, and Persistence. These are all central themes in the text.

I need to make sure all keys and values are enclosed in quotes and that it's properly formatted as a JSON object.
