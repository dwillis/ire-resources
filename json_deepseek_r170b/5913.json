Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given input. Let me break down the requirements step by step.

First, the user provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The task is to convert this into a specific JSON structure with keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

Starting with the `id`, it's given as 5913. That’s straightforward.

Next, the `authors` should be a list of objects, each containing name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the input, I see two names: Troy Thibodeaux and Meghan Hoyer. Their emails are tthibodeaux@ap.org and mhoyer@ap.org respectively. The affiliation isn't directly mentioned next to their names, but since they’re from The Associated Press, that will be their affiliation.

The `conference` is clearly stated as IRE. So, the value here is "IRE".

For the `year`, it’s specified as June 14, 2019, so the year is 2019.

The `title` of the session is "2019 IRE: SQL Hands-On Daylong Session".

Now, the `description` needs to be a concise summary. The tutorial covers SQL using SQLite with hands-on exercises and Legos. So, summarizing that into one or two sentences makes sense.

Lastly, the `keywords`. They should exclude the conference and authors but include relevant terms like SQL, SQLite, data journalism, etc. I need to pick up to five keywords. From the context, "SQL", "SQLite", "data journalism", and "hands-on training" are appropriate.

Putting it all together, I structure each part ensuring correct formatting and that all values are in English as specified.
