Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided query. The user has given specific instructions about what each key should contain.

First, looking at the input, the title of the tipsheet is "USING SOLUTIONS JOURNALISM IN INVESTIGATIONS" and the author is Tina Rosenberg from the Solutions Journalism Network. Her email is tina@solutionsjournalism.org.

The conference isn't explicitly mentioned, so I'll set it to "Not Listed". The year also isn't provided, so that will be "Not Listed" as well.

For the description, I need a concise summary in 1-2 sentences. The main idea is how solutions journalism can enhance investigations by showing positive examples and prompting change.

Keywords should include terms like "solutions journalism", "investigative reporting", etc., up to five relevant ones without including the conference or authors.

I'll structure all this into the JSON format as specified, ensuring each key is properly quoted and values are correctly formatted.
