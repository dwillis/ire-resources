Alright, I'm looking at this query where someone wants to create a JSON object from their provided input. They have specific instructions on how to structure it with keys like id, authors, conference, etc. 

First, the id is given as 5825, so that's straightforward. Next, for the authors section, they mention several people with emails and affiliations. I need to parse each contact info line correctly. For example, Sophie Chou has an email and affiliation listed, so her entry in the JSON should reflect that. 

I notice Mark Fahey appears twice with different emails, which might be a typo or mistake. Since the user said not to make up names and leave null if not available, I'll include both instances as they are. For Nadia Hamdan, her affiliation isn't directly listed, but since she's associated with KUT, that should be her affiliation.

The conference key needs to be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Looking through the text, there's no mention of a specific conference name, so I'll default it to "Not Listed". 

For the year, the provided timeline goes from 2018 to 2019, but without a clear event year specified. Hence, I'll set year as "Not Listed" too.

The description should be a concise summary. The main topic seems to be about how police departments clear sexual assault cases without actual convictions, leading to reforms. So, I'll craft a brief sentence capturing that essence.

Keywords need to be up to five terms. From the context, appropriate keywords would include "sexual assault", "police clearance", "investigative journalism", "law enforcement reform", and "crime reporting".

I also have to ensure all values are in English unless otherwise noted, which they are here. Each key and value must be enclosed in quotes as per JSON standards.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with each section carefully filled out based on the provided data and guidelines.
