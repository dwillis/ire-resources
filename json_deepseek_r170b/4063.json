Okay, I need to create a JSON object from the given input based on specific instructions. Let me break down what's required.

First, the id should be 4063 as specified. 

Next, authors: The input mentions Jeremy B. Merrill, who is an Interactive News Developer at NYT and a core developer of Tabula. So I'll list him with his name, email null since it's not provided, and affiliation as "The New York Times".

Conference: It's from Investigative Reporters and Editors, so the conference should be "IRE". 

Year: The input doesn't specify the year, so I'll put "Not Listed".

Title: The talk is about getting data from PDFs into usable formats. So a suitable title would be "Getting Data Out of PDFs".

Description: A 1-2 sentence summary. The main points are that PDF scraping is a last resort and better to get real data, so the description should reflect that.

Keywords: Up to five terms. From the content, relevant keywords include "PDF extraction", "data journalism", "Tabula", "scraping tools", and "FOIA". These are all central to the talk's content.

I'll structure this information into a JSON object with each key appropriately filled out.

```json
{
  "id": 4063,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Getting Data Out of PDFs",
  "description": "A session discussing the challenges and tools for extracting data from PDFs, emphasizing that scraping should be a last resort.",
  "keywords": [
    "PDF extraction",
    "data journalism",
    "Tabula",
    "scraping tools",
    "FOIA"
  ]
}
```
