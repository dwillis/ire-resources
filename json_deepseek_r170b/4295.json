Okay, I need to figure out how to create a JSON object based on the user's instructions from their Excel guide. The user provided a detailed description of various Excel functions like IF statements, LEN, PROPER, and others, along with examples.

First, let me break down the requirements for the JSON object. It should have keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. 

The id is given as 4295. For authors, each entry in the list needs name, email, and affiliation. The user mentioned not to make up names; if none are listed, leave name as null. Email and affiliation can be null too. If a news organization's name is in the text, use that as affiliation.

The description should be 1-2 sentences summarizing the text in simple language. Conference must be "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Year is also either specific or "Not Listed" if unclear. Keywords are up to five terms, excluding conference and authors' names.

Now, looking at the provided Excel content, I see it's about functions like IF statements, LEN, PROPER, etc., with examples from worksheets like "BasicIF", "More BasicIF". There's also a part about creating bar charts using REPT.

So, the title could be something like "Excel Functions Guide" since that's what the text is about. 

For authors, the guide doesn't mention any specific names or affiliations, so each author entry should have name as null, email and affiliation as null.

Conference: Since it's an Excel guide, not tied to a specific conference like IRE or NICAR, it should be "Not Listed".

Year is also not mentioned, so that will be "Not Listed".

Description: A brief summary of the text. It talks about various Excel functions with examples, so maybe something like "A guide explaining various Excel functions with practical examples."

Keywords would include terms like "Excel Functions", "IF statements", "LEN", "PROPER", and "REPT" as they are key topics covered.

I need to ensure all keys and values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. No markdown, just a JSON object.

```json
{
  "id": 4295,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Excel Functions Guide",
  "description": "A guide explaining various Excel functions with practical examples.",
  "keywords": [
    "Excel Functions",
    "IF statements",
    "LEN",
    "PROPER",
    "REPT"
  ]
}
```
