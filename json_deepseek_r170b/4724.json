Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a snippet of what seems to be notes or slides from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference, specifically NICAR 2016. They want me to create a JSON object describing a tipsheet based on the input given.

First, I need to identify the key elements required for the JSON structure: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is provided as 4724, so that's straightforward.

Looking at the content, the conference is clearly mentioned as NICAR 2016, which means the conference field will be "NICAR" and the year will be 2016.

Next, I need to determine the title of the tipsheet. The recurring question in the input is "What is a 'news app,' exactly?" asked by Jacquima Her. This seems central, so the title should reflect that.

For the authors, Jacquima Her is mentioned multiple times, but there's no email or affiliation provided. Other names like Mike Rastiello and Margaret Sullivan are also present. Their affiliations aren't explicitly stated next to their names, so I'll list them without affiliations unless they're associated with a news organization mentioned in the text.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet discusses defining what a "news app" is within journalism, especially interactive and data-driven apps, touching on CMS challenges and examples from The New York Times.

Keywords should capture the essence without including the conference or authors. Terms like "news app," "interactive journalism," "CMS," "investigative reporting," and "NICAR" fit well, but since NICAR is the conference, I'll exclude it to avoid redundancy. So, I'll settle on four relevant keywords.

Putting it all together, I structure each part carefully, ensuring no made-up data and that all details align with the provided content.
