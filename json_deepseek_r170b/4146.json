Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user has provided a chunk of data that seems to be about investigative journalism or something similar. They've asked to create a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. 

First, I need to parse the input text to extract relevant information. Looking at the text, it's mostly about consumer preferences regarding investigative content, sources used, and some demographic breakdowns like gender and political views. There are mentions of where people first encounter investigative stories, with TV being the top source.

I notice that the user also provided an example JSON structure, but in their initial attempt, they didn't include any authors or conference details because none were present in the text. The id is given as 4146, which I should use. 

Now, considering the keys:

- **id**: Straightforward, it's 4146.
- **authors**: Since no specific authors are mentioned, this will be an empty list.
- **conference**: The text doesn't indicate any conference, so it'll be "Not Listed".
- **year**: Similarly, there's no year provided, so "Not Listed" again.
- **title**: I need to come up with a concise title based on the content. Maybe something about consumer preferences in investigative reporting.
- **description**: A brief summary of the data. It should mention the main points like primary sources (TV), demographics, and topics like corruption or accountability.
- **keywords**: Up to five relevant terms. From the text, keywords could include "investigative journalism", "consumer preferences", "news sources", "demographics", and "crowdsourcing".

I also need to ensure that all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. No markdown should be present in the final JSON.

Wait, the user mentioned something about crowdsourcing at the end of their text. I should include that in the keywords since it's a relevant term from the data.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON accordingly without any additional formatting or errors.

```json
{
  "id": "4146",
  "authors": [],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Consumer Preferences in Investigative Reporting",
  "description": "A study on consumer preferences regarding investigative journalism, including sources used and demographic breakdowns.",
  "keywords": ["investigative journalism", "consumer preferences", "news sources", "demographics"]
}
```
