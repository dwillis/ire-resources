Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. Let me first read through the provided information carefully.

The session is titled "GETTING STARTED" from the Global Investigative Journalism Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, held on May 2, 2003. The speaker is Luz Rimban from the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism.

First, I need to extract the required keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. 

The id should be T289 as specified. For the authors, there's only one speaker mentioned, Luz Rimban. Since her email isn't provided, it will be null, and her affiliation is clearly stated as Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism.

Next, the conference name is Global Investigative Journalism Conference. I need to check if this falls under IRE, NICAR, or neither. From what I know, IRE stands for Investigative Reporters and Editors, which is a well-known organization in this field. The Global Investigative Journalism Conference isn't directly associated with IRE, so the conference key should be "Not Listed".

The year is clearly stated as 2003, so that's straightforward.

The title of the session is "GETTING STARTED". For the description, I need a concise summary in simple language. It should mention the tips and strategies for launching an investigative story, including internet research, hypothesis formulation, planning, and collaboration.

Now, keywords are up to five terms excluding conference and authors. The main points from the text include investigation techniques, so I'll choose relevant terms like "investigative journalism", "research methods", "story planning", "source strategies", and "collaboration".

Putting it all together, I structure each key with appropriate values ensuring correct formatting and handling of nulls where information isn't available.
