Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the ID is given as 3740_1, so that's straightforward. Now, looking at the authors: Wendy Halloran is listed as the investigative reporter for KPNX 12 News. Carl ToersBijns is mentioned as a retired Deputy Warden from the Arizona Department of Corrections. There’s also a note about a deputy warden contributing, but no name is provided, so I’ll leave that author's name as null.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, and since the year isn't specified in the text, it should be "Not Listed". The title is "Investigating Prison Abuse".

For the description, I need a concise summary. It should mention the challenges of investigating prison abuse, including evidence collection and roadblocks like incomplete records or destruction of evidence.

Keywords are next. Important terms from the content include "prison abuse", "evidence collection", "investigation techniques", "roadblocks", and "transparency". I'll limit it to five relevant words.

Putting it all together, each part is mapped correctly without making up any information.
