Alright, so I'm trying to create this JSON object based on the tipsheet provided. Let me go through it step by step.

First, I need to extract the necessary information from the input text. The user has given a document that's part of an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference, updated in 2016. The authors mentioned are Jaimi Dowdell and Mark Horvit, both affiliated with IRE/NICAR.

The title isn't explicitly stated, but the main topic is about online resources for journalists. So I'll go with "Online Resources for Journalists" as the title.

For the description, it should be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers various search techniques and tools, so I'll write something like: "Tips and tools for journalists on advanced search techniques, people searches, social media, public records, and data scraping."

Now, the keywords need to be relevant and limited to five. Looking through the content, the main areas are search techniques, online resources, people searching, social media, and public records. So I'll choose those as the keywords.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE/NICAR, so that's straightforward. The year is given as 2016 since it was updated in March of that year.

Next, handling the authors: Jaimi Dowdell and Mark Horvit are listed without emails or affiliations beyond IRE/NICAR. So each author entry will have their name, null for email, and "IRE/NICAR" as affiliation.

Putting it all together, the JSON structure should include id, title, description, conference, year, authors, and keywords. Each part is filled based on the extracted information.

I need to ensure that the JSON syntax is correct, with proper commas and quotation marks. Also, since some values like email are not provided, they should be set to null.

Double-checking everything: id is 4637 as specified, authors have their names and affiliations, conference is correctly noted, year is accurate, description is concise, and keywords are relevant and within the limit.

I think that's all. Time to structure it into a proper JSON object.

```json
{
  "id": 4637,
  "title": "Online Resources for Journalists",
  "description": "A tipsheet covering advanced search techniques, people searches, social media tools, public records and data scraping resources for journalists.",
  "keywords": ["search techniques", "online resources", "people searching", "social media", "public records"],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2016,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Jaimi Dowdell",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "IRE/NICAR"
    },
    {
      "name": "Mark Horvit",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "IRE/NICAR"
    }
  ]
}
```
