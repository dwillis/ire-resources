Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, I'll identify the required keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 4020, so that's straightforward.

Looking at the authors section, the tipsheet mentions Sheila S. Coronel from Columbia University. Her email and affiliation are provided, so I can include those. There might be other contributors mentioned, but since only her name is explicitly listed with contact info, others will have null values for name, email, and affiliation.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's set. The year isn't directly mentioned in the text, so it should be "Not Listed".

For the title, the main focus seems to be on tracing assets and tracking lifestyles, so I'll use that as the title. 

The description needs a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about using financial records and lifestyle checks to uncover corruption, so I'll phrase that into a 1-2 sentence overview.

Keywords should include terms like asset tracing, lifestyle tracking, financial records, corporate records, and shell companies since these are central themes in the document.

Putting it all together, ensuring each key is properly formatted with quotes and correct data types. No markdown, just plain JSON.
