Okay, I need to help the user create a JSON object from their input about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me break down what they've given me.

First, they provided details of a session titled "CAR Broadcast Skills: Finding Story Ideas" presented by Chris Cantergiani from WSB-TV at the IRE Atlanta 2004 conference. The content includes information on Computer-Assisted Reporting techniques, types of stories suitable for CAR, budget considerations, legal aspects like FOIA and Open Record Requests, data sources, storytelling tips, negotiating data, creating your own datasets, and story ideas.

They want a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is T2142, which I should include as given. 

Looking at the authors section, it's a list where each entry has name, email, and affiliation. Chris Cantergiani is listed without an email or affiliation beyond WSB-TV, so I'll set his affiliation to that. Since email isn't provided, it remains null.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE Atlanta 2004, so the conference key will be "IRE" and year is 2004.

For the title, it's given as "CAR Broadcast Skills: Finding Story Ideas." The description needs to be a concise summary. I'll mention CAR techniques and data-driven storytelling since those are central themes.

Keywords should include up to five relevant terms. From the content, Computer-Assisted Reporting (CAR), story ideas, databases, FOIA, and Open Records stand out as key concepts.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly quoted. I'll structure the JSON accordingly, making sure each key is present and correctly formatted.
