Alright, so I need to help create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conferences. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON.

First, let me read through the input carefully. It's about the Fund for Investigative Journalism (FIJ). They provide grants up to $10,000 for freelance or independent journalists. The criteria include submitting a proposal with details and a budget, applying three to four times a year. Examples of grantees are Christina Goldbaum and Seymour Hersh.

Now, I need to map this into the JSON structure they want. The keys required are id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The id is given as 5659_4. So that's straightforward.

Authors: It says "Create a list containing elements with name, email, affiliation." But in the input, there are no specific author names mentioned. It just refers to FIJ journalists and examples of grantees like Christina Goldbaum and Seymour Hersh. Since the text doesn't explicitly mention an author for this tipsheet, I think it's appropriate to leave authors as null or an empty list. Wait, in their previous example, they used an empty array, so maybe that's better.

Conference: The input is from IRE conferences, so conference should be "IRE".

Year: It doesn't specify the year of the event, so it should be "Not Listed".

Title: From the input, the main title seems to be "Fund for Investigative Journalism" or more specifically, since it's a tipsheet, maybe just "Fund for Investigative Journalism Grants". But in their example, they used "Fund for Investigative Journalism" as the title.

Description: Needs to be 1-2 sentences. So something like, "The Fund for Investigative Journalism provides grants up to $10,000 for freelance journalists to support investigative reporting projects."

Keywords: Up to five terms. From the text, keywords could include grant, investigative journalism, freelance, reporters, funding. Maybe also proposals or budget.

Putting it all together:

- id: "5659_4"
- authors: []
- conference: "IRE"
- year: "Not Listed"
- title: "Fund for Investigative Journalism"
- description: "The Fund for Investigative Journalism provides grants up to $10,000 for freelance journalists to support investigative reporting projects."
- keywords: ["grant", "investigative journalism", "freelance", "reporters", "funding"]

I need to ensure all keys are in quotes and the structure is correct. No markdown, just JSON.
