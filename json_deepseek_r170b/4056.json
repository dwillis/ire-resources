Okay, so I need to help this user create a JSON object from the given tipsheet. Let me read through their instructions again carefully.

The user provided a document with details about an NPR investigation on accessible playgrounds. They want a specific JSON structure with keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. 

First, I need to assign each part correctly. The id is given as 4056. For the authors section, it lists Robert Benincasa from NPR News Investigations. His email isn't provided, so I'll set that to null.

The conference mentioned in the document is NICAR 2014 in Baltimore, so the conference key should be "NICAR" and year is 2014. The title of the tipsheet is "Accessible Playgrounds: Building A Database."

Now, for the description, it needs a concise summary. I'll focus on how they built a national database with GIS features, including user contributions.

Keywords are next. They must exclude conference and authors. So, relevant terms here would be accessible playgrounds, database, GIS, NPR News Investigations, and location-aware app.

I should make sure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Let me structure this without using any markdown as per their request.

    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": 2014,
  "title": "Accessible Playgrounds: Building A Database",
  "description": "A tipsheet detailing the creation of a national database of accessible playgrounds, including features like GIS capabilities and user contributions.",
  "keywords": [
