Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from the NICAR 2018 conference. The user has given specific instructions on what keys to include: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. Each of these needs to be filled out correctly.

First, let's extract the necessary information step by step. 

Starting with the ID, it's given as 5468. That's straightforward.

Next, the authors. The tipsheet lists three people: Nick Penzenstadler from USA TODAY, Matt Drange from Forbes, and Kim Smith from Urban Labs at the University of Chicago. I need to structure each author with name, email, and affiliation. For emails, only Kim Smith has one provided. Affiliations are clear for all based on their positions.

The conference is NICAR 2018, so that's easy to fill in.

For the year, it's clearly stated as 2018.

The title of the tipsheet is "Shoot us straight – NICAR 2018". That seems appropriate.

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about investigating gun dealers and tracing firearms. It includes data sources like FFL revocations and background checks. So I should write a 1-2 sentence summary that captures this focus on resources for journalists covering gun policies and enforcement.

Keywords are next. They need to be no more than five, excluding the conference and authors. Looking at the content, relevant terms include "gun dealers", "firearms tracing", "FFL revocations", "background checks", and "data journalism". That covers the main topics without overlap.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part into the JSON format as specified. Making sure that all keys are in quotes and values are correctly formatted. No markdown, just plain JSON.
