Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through the requirements step by step.

First, the user specified that the JSON should have certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 3473. 

Looking at the authors section, I see Steve Doig from Cronkite School and Burt Hubbard from Rocky Mtn INN. Their emails aren't provided, so those will be null. Affiliations are their respective organizations.

The conference is clearly marked as "IRE" since it's from Investigative Reporters and Editors. The year is 2011 as indicated by the copyright notice.

For the title, I'll use something descriptive like "Analyzing Census Data for Diversity and Segregation." 

The description needs to be a concise summary. I'll write that it explains methods for analyzing diversity and segregation using census data, mentioning the diversity index and segregation index.

Keywords should be relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. So, I'll include "census data," "diversity index," "segregation index," "racial analysis," and "demographic trends."

Putting it all together, I need to ensure all keys are in quotes and the structure is correct. Let me format this properly.
