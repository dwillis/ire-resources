Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided specific instructions, so let me break it down step by step.

First, the id is straightforwardâ€”it's 3418 as per the tipsheet number. Next, looking at the authors section. I see David McKie listed with his email and affiliation to CBC News. There are no other authors mentioned, so the authors list will only include him.

The conference is clearly an IRE event since that's where the tipsheet originated. The year is 2010 as indicated by the copyright notice. For the title, "Covering the Military" seems appropriate based on the content.

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about approaches for journalists covering military stories, including both short-term and long-term strategies. So I'll craft a sentence that captures this essence without getting too detailed.

Keywords are next. I need up to five terms excluding the conference name. Looking through the content, "military coverage," "investigative journalism," "public records," "contractor fairness," and "health trends" stand out as relevant keywords.

I also need to ensure all keys and values are in English and properly quoted. Since all information is present except for any additional authors, I can leave other potential author fields as null if needed, but in this case, only David McKie is listed.

Double-checking everything: id, authors with correct details, conference set to "IRE", year as 2010, a clear title and description, and five relevant keywords. I think that covers all the user's requirements.
