Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided input. Let me start by understanding what's required.

First, the id is given as 5226. That's straightforward. Next, the authors are listed with name, email, and affiliation. I should check each author in the text.

Looking at the input, there are three main sections about different projects: one from Steal, another about Abusive, and the last about Toxic. Each section mentions a person. 

For "Steal," the author is Melvin Burgess with an email melvin.burgess@thetimes.co.uk and affiliation The Times. Then, for "Abusive," it's Sarah Kendzior with sarahkendzior@gmail.com and affiliation as Author. Lastly, "Toxic" has James Ball, james.ball@theguardian.com from The Guardian.

The conference isn't explicitly mentioned in the text, so I'll set that to "Not Listed." The year is also not provided, so it remains "Not Listed."

The title should capture the essence of each project. Steal is about data journalism on politics and media, Abusive focuses on Trump's election and Russian involvement, Toxic covers Brexit and misinformation.

For the description, I need a 1-2 sentence summary in simple terms. It should explain that these projects are examples of using data journalism to investigate political events and their impacts.

Keywords: The main topics across all projects are Data Journalism, Politics, Media, Trump, Brexit, Russia, Misinformation. But since keywords should be no more than five, I'll pick the most relevant ones.

Putting it all together, I structure each part step by step.
