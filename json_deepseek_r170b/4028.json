Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the id is straightforward: it's 4028 as specified. Next, I need to look at the authors section. The text mentions Peter Aldhous with his email and Twitter handle, but no explicit affiliation. However, since he might be affiliated with a news organization, I should check if any is mentioned. It doesn't seem so, so his affiliation will remain null.

The conference is clearly stated as NICAR 2014 in Baltimore, so the conference key should be "NICAR". The year is given as February 28, 2014, during the event, so year is 2014.

For the title, it's about using NodeXL for analyzing social media networks, specifically focusing on a hands-on workshop. So I'll title it accordingly to reflect that focus.

The description needs to be concise, summarizing what the session covers in simple terms. It should mention the tools and techniques taught, such as network analysis metrics and visualization.

Keywords are next; I need up to five relevant terms excluding conference and authors. The tipsheet talks about NodeXL, social media networks, network analysis, betweenness centrality, and Eigenvector centrality. These seem appropriate.

I also need to ensure all keys and values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. No markdown or additional formatting should be present.

Putting it all together now.
