Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the ID is given as 4685_1, which seems straightforward. Next, authors: looking at the text, there are no specific authors mentioned. It's more of a general tipsheet, so I'll set each author's name to null. Since there's no email or affiliation provided either, those will also be null.

The conference is clearly about SQL joins, and since it's from an IRE conference, that's the value for "conference". The year isn't mentioned anywhere in the text, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

For the title, the main focus is on joining SQL tables to link employee information with salaries. So a suitable title would be something like "Joining Tables with SQL for Investigative Journalism".

The description needs to be concise. The tipsheet explains how to combine two tables using SQL joins, specifically using EmployeeID to merge employee details and salary data. I'll summarize that in one or two sentences.

Keywords should capture the essence without including the conference or authors. Relevant terms would be "SQL", "JOIN", "EmployeeID", " LEFT JOIN", and "data journalism". These are all key concepts covered in the text.

Putting it all together, I structure each part into the JSON format as specified.

```json
{
  "id": "4685_1",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Joining Tables with SQL for Investigative Journalism",
  "description": "Learn how to combine employee and salary data using SQL JOINs to uncover connections between employee information and their annual salaries.",
  "keywords": ["SQL", "JOIN", "EmployeeID", "LEFT JOIN", "data journalism"]
}
```
