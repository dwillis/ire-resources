Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the user has specified several keys that need to be included: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 5721, so I'll just plug that in.

Looking at the authors section, there are three people listed: Katrice Hardy, Phil Williams, and R.G. Dunlop. Each of them has an email and an affiliation. For each author, I need to create an object with name, email, and affiliation. The affiliations are clearly stated next to their names in the tipsheet, so that's straightforward.

Next, the conference is identified as IRE because it's explicitly mentioned at the top as "IRE Tipsheet." The year is also given as 2018 since the date is June 16, 2018. So those two keys are easy to fill out.

The title of the tipsheet is right there: "Post-Publication Strategies for Investigative Journalists," so I'll use that directly. 

For the description, it needs to be a concise summary in simple language. The tipsheet talks about what journalists should do after publishing an investigation to maintain relationships and ensure impact. So I can write something like, "Strategies for handling the aftermath of an investigative report to maintain credibility and source relationships."

Now, the keywords are up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords could be "investigative journalism," "post-publication strategies," "source management," "media impact," and "accuracy." These cover the main topics discussed.

I also need to ensure all values are in English unless otherwise specified, which they are here. All keys and string values should be enclosed in quotes as per JSON standards.

Double-checking everything: id is 5721, authors have their correct details, conference is IRE, year is 2018, title and description are concise, keywords are relevant and within the limit. Seems good!
