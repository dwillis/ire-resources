Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. The input provided is about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet titled "REPORTING ON GUNS AS A CONSUMER PRODUCT." 

First, I'll parse through the content to extract necessary information. The ID should be 3502 as specified. Looking at the authors, Scott Cohn is listed with his email and affiliation to CNBC. There's no other author mentioned, so the authors list will have only one entry.

Next, the conference is clearly stated as "IRE" since it's from the IRE National Conference in Orlando, Florida, held in 2011. The title of the tipsheet is given as "REPORTING ON GUNS AS A CONSUMER PRODUCT."

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet discusses how to investigate firearms as consumer products, highlighting issues like safety standards and the example of Remington's 700 series rifles. So, I'll craft a one-sentence summary capturing that essence.

Keywords are important and should be no more than five. Relevant terms include "guns," "consumer product," "Remington," "firearms safety," and "investigative reporting." These encapsulate the main topics without including the conference or authors.

I also need to ensure all values are in English, keys are enclosed in quotes, and the structure follows JSON syntax correctly. Double-checking for any missing information: year is 2011, conference is IRE, and authors only include Scott Cohn with his details.

Finally, I'll assemble everything into a properly formatted JSON object, making sure each key is present and values are accurate as per the input.
