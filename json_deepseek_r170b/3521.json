Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id is given as 3521, so that's straightforward. Next, I look at the authors section. The text mentions Jeff Taylor from Detroit Free Press, Mike Connelly from Sarasota Herald-Tribune, and John Cutter from Orlando Sentinel. Since there are no emails provided, those will be null. Each author's affiliation is clear from their respective news organizations.

For the conference details, it's specified as IRE National Conference in Orlando, Florida, June 2011. So, the conference key will be "IRE" and the year is 2011. The title of the tipsheet is "Building a Watchdog Culture."

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The main points are about structuring newsrooms for watchdog work, infusing that culture, freeing up time, providing resources, and selling the value to bosses. I'll condense this into 1-2 sentences.

Keywords should be no more than five terms related to the content but excluding conference and authors. Suitable keywords might be "watchdog journalism," "newsroom structure," "investigative reporting," "journalism resources," and "media strategy."

I also need to ensure all keys are in quotes, values are correctly formatted, and there's no markdown since it's a JSON response.
