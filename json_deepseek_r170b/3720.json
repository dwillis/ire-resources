Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me read through the query again to make sure I understand what's required.

The user wants a JSON response with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is 3720. Authors should be a list of objects each containing name, email, and affiliation. If any info isn't present, it should be null. The description needs to be a concise summary in simple language. Conference must be "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Year is straightforward, but if not clear, it's "Not Listed". Keywords are up to five terms excluding the conference and authors.

Looking at the tipsheet, Jack Gillum from AP is listed with his email and Twitter handle. The conference was IRE 2012 in Boston, so the year is 2012. The title is about campaign backgrounding candidates. The description should summarize the key points: using documents, data, financials, legal issues, etc., to investigate candidates.

I need to extract all that information correctly into the JSON structure without making up any details and ensuring proper formatting.
