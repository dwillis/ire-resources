Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON, so I should follow them carefully.

First, the id is specified as "5673_2". Next, I look at the authors section. There's one author mentioned: Steve Eder from The New York Times, with his email provided. So, the authors list will have one object with name, email, and affiliation.

The conference is clearly stated as #IRE18, so that goes into the conference field. The year isn't explicitly given, but since IRE conferences are annual and 2018 makes sense for #IRE18, I'll set year to 2018.

For the title, it's taken directly from the header: "What is that politician hiding? And other backgrounding tips". The description needs to be a concise summary. Looking at the content, it focuses on investigative techniques for covering politicians, so I'll craft a one-sentence summary about that.

Keywords should be up to five relevant terms. From the tipsheet, important aspects include backgrounding, public records, investigative reporting, and political coverage. These make suitable keywords.

I need to ensure all keys are in quotes and the structure is correct. Also, check for any missing information. For example, since there's only one author, the authors array has just one entry. No other authors are mentioned, so that's handled.

Finally, I'll format everything into JSON, making sure each value is properly enclosed in quotes and the overall structure is valid.
