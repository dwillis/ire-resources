Okay, so I need to create a JSON object from the provided tipsheet. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll read through the entire query to understand what's needed. The user wants a response that's only a JSON object describing a tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conferences. They've given specific instructions on the structure of the JSON, including keys like id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

Looking at the input provided, it starts with a question about why college costs so much and where the money goes. Then there are sections listing various stories and resources from different conferences in 2013, specifically San Antonio. The authors listed are Holly Hacker from The Dallas Morning News, Janet Lorin from Bloomberg News, and Scott Thurm from The Wall Street Journal.

I need to map this information into the JSON structure. The id is given as 3920. For authors, I have to create a list of objects each containing name, email, and affiliation. Since emails are provided, I'll include those. Affiliations are the news organizations mentioned next to each author's name.

The conference is clearly stated as Investigative Reporters & Editors (IRE) in San Antonio 2013, so conference will be "IRE" and year will be 2013. The title of the tipsheet is the initial question: "Why does college cost so much and where does the money go?" 

For the description, I need a concise summary. Looking at the sections—administrative bloat, financial aid, loan debt for both parents and students, online classes, salaries, state funding, and U.S. Department of Education data—it's clear that the tipsheet examines rising college costs through various factors like administrative spending, student loans, and shifts in funding sources.

Keywords should be a list of up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. From the sections, "administrative bloat," "financial aid," "student loan debt," "college costs," and "state funding" seem appropriate.

I need to ensure that all values are enclosed in quotes and that the JSON is properly formatted without any markdown. Also, the user mentioned that if some attributes aren't present, they should be null, but here, all necessary info seems available.

Double-checking everything: id is 3920, authors have names, emails, affiliations correctly assigned. Conference is IRE, year is 2013, title and description are accurate. Keywords are relevant and within the limit.

I think that's all covered. Now, I'll structure this into a JSON object as specified.
