Alright, I need to create a JSON object from the given input based on the user's specifications. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the user provided contact information for three individuals: Andrew Siegel, Stephen Stock, and Rick Yarborough. Each has an email address and some have phone numbers or affiliations. Since the authors are part of CBS News and Fox TV, I'll note their affiliations accordingly.

Next, the title of the tipsheet is "Navigating the Social Network Minefield." The conference isn't explicitly mentioned, but since it's from Investigative Reporters and Editors, the conference should be listed as "IRE." However, in the input, there's no specific year given, so I'll set the year to "Not Listed."

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet discusses using social networks for journalism, highlighting benefits and risks, and emphasizes verification of online information.

Keywords are next. They should be relevant but not include the conference or authors. From the content, "social media," "journalism," "online research," "verification," and "copyright" seem appropriate.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part into the JSON format as specified. Each author will have their details filled in where possible, with nulls for missing information.
