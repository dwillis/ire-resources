Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, the structure: id should be 4587. Got it. The authors are a list, each with name, email, and affiliation. Since there's no author listed in the input, all those fields will be null. 

Next, conference. Looking at the content, I see mentions of "government coverage," "enterprise stories," and tips that seem relevant to investigative journalism. IRE conferences often cover such topics, so I'll set conference to "IRE". If it were NICAR, it might involve more data stuff, but this seems more about reporting strategies.

Year is tricky because the input doesn't specify when the event took place. So year will be "Not Listed".

Title should reflect the main idea. The input talks about covering government beyond meetings and elections, so I'll go with something like "Beyond Meetings and Elections: Strategic Government Reporting."

Description needs to be a concise summary. It's about advising reporters on how to focus their coverage effectively.

Keywords are up to five terms. I'll pick "government reporting", "enterprise journalism", "investigative reporting", "beat reporting", and "journalism tips" as they capture the essence without including the conference or authors.

Putting it all together, ensuring everything is in English and enclosed in quotes.
