Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to create this JSON object based on the user's query. Let me read through everything carefully.

First, the user provided some conference materials about handling FOIA denials by Charles Davis and David Cuillier. They also gave a specific structure for the JSON output with id 2984. The authors should be listed with their names, emails, and affiliations if available. 

Looking at the text, I see that both Charles Davis and David Cuillier are mentioned as authors of the handouts. However, there's no email or affiliation provided for either of them in the given text. So, for each author, I'll set name to their respective names and email and affiliation to null.

The conference is likely "NICAR" since that's where these materials are typically presented, but I'm not entirely sure without more context. The year isn't explicitly mentioned, so I'll default to "Not Listed".

For the description, I need a 1-2 sentence summary. The text discusses how to handle denials of FOIA requests, including specific scenarios and how to respond appropriately.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords might be "FOIA", "denials", "exemptions", "public records", and "appeals".

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with these elements, ensuring all keys are in quotes and values follow the specified rules.
