Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, I'll look at the structure required: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as "4085_Part_2". 

Next, for the authors, there are three speakers listed. Each author should have name, email, and affiliation. For Jack Gillum, his affiliation is the Associated Press. Aaron Bycoffe is from Huffington Post, but I notice that in the text it's written as "Huffington Post" with a capital 'P'. Wait, no, looking again, the email is bycoffe@huffingtonpost.com, so the correct affiliation should be "Huffington Post". Similarly, Christopher Schnaars is affiliated with USA TODAY.

The conference is IRE because it's from NICAR which is part of IRE. The year isn't explicitly mentioned, but since the tipsheet refers to the 2012 presidential race and mentions a guide from NICAR2014, I can infer that the year is 2014.

For the title, the first line says "Campaign finance I: Mining FEC data", so that's clear. 

The description should be a concise summary of the session. It covered how to read campaign finance reports, download FEC data, and use online tools. So something like, "This tipsheet provides guidance on analyzing campaign finance data from the Federal Election Commission (FEC), including how to read reports, find data, and utilize online tools."

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. So relevant keywords are: "campaign finance", "FEC data", "Super PACs", "election contributions", and "data journalism".

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part into the JSON object, ensuring that all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes.
