Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided query. Let's see what the user is asking for.

First, they want the response to only be a JSON object describing a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The input provided includes stored procedures and cursors examples from NICAR, which I know stands for the National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting, part of IRE.

The user specified several keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. They also gave detailed instructions on how to fill each key. 

Starting with the id, it should be T1815 as per their instruction. Next, authors is a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. In the input, there's only one author listed: Matthew Ericson with the email matte@nytimes.com. Since his affiliation isn't explicitly mentioned but he's from The New York Times (as indicated by the email), I should use that as his affiliation.

The conference is NICAR because the examples are from a session at the NICAR conference, so that's clear. The year isn't provided in the input, so it should be "Not Listed".

For the title, looking at the input, the main topic is about stored procedures and cursors with SQL Server, so I'll use that as the title.

The description needs to be a concise 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet shows how to calculate medians, ranks, percentiles, quintiles, and crosstabs using SQL Server, which is exactly what the input describes.

Keywords should be up to five terms. From the content, relevant keywords are stored procedures, cursors, SQL Server, median calculation, and crosstabs.

Putting it all together, I need to structure this into a JSON object with the specified keys and values. I'll make sure all strings are in English and properly quoted.

```json
{
  "id": "T1815",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": "matte@nytimes.com",
      "affiliation": "The New York Times"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Stored Procedures and Cursors with SQL Server",
  "description": "This tipsheet demonstrates how to calculate medians, ranks, percentiles, quintiles, and crosstabs in Microsoft SQL Server using stored procedures and cursors.",
  "keywords": [
    "stored procedures",
    "cursors",
    "SQL Server",
    "median calculation",
    "crosstabs"
  ]
}
```
