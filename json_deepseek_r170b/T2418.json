Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on this tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the ID is given as T2418, that's straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors section. The tipsheet is written by Miles Moffeit from The Denver Post. His email is mmoffeit@denverpost.com and his affiliation is clearly The Denver Post. So I'll structure the author object with name, email, and affiliation filled in accordingly.

The conference information shows it's the IRE National Conference held in Denver from June 2-5, 2005. So the conference key will be "IRE" and the year is 2005.

For the title, it's listed as "Using Narrative Techniques in Investigative Stories". That's clear and concise.

The description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet talks about using narrative techniques like character development, suspense, and emotional landscapes to make investigative stories more engaging. So I'll summarize that.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords are "narrative techniques", "investigative storytelling", "character development", "suspense", and "emotional landscape". 

Putting it all together, each key needs to be in quotes with appropriate values. Making sure that all data types are correctâ€”arrays for authors and keywords, strings otherwise.

I should double-check that I haven't missed any details or made up any information not provided. Everything seems accounted for based on the input.
