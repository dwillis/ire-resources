Okay, so I need to create a JSON object from this tipsheet provided by Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conferences. The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain. Let me go through it step by step.

First, the ID is given as 5696_2, so that's straightforward. Next, authors are listed, and in this case, there's only one author mentioned: Katie Sanders from PolitiFact with her email provided. I need to structure each author as an object with name, email, and affiliation. Since the affiliation isn't explicitly stated next to her name but she works at PolitiFact, that should be fine.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's simple. The year of the event is June 15, 2018, so I'll use 2018 for that field.

The title is "Tips of the Truth-O-Meter," which is the heading provided. Now, the description needs to be a concise summary in 1-2 sentences. I should capture the essence of combating misinformation and strategies used by PolitiFact during campaigns and tragedies. 

For keywords, I need up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords would include "misinformation," "disinformation," "fact-checking," "campaign coverage," and "mass shootings." These seem appropriate as they cover the main topics discussed.

I also need to ensure that all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. No markdown is allowed, just a plain JSON object. I should double-check each field to make sure there are no typos or formatting issues.
