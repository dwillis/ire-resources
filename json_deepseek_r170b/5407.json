Okay, I need to create a JSON object from the given tipsheet. Let me start by understanding what's required.

First, the id is fixed at 5407. Got that.

Looking for authors: The tipsheet mentions Neena Kapur, so she's an author. Her email and affiliation aren't provided, so they'll be null.

Conference: Since it's from IRE conferences, I'll set conference to "IRE".

Year: The text doesn't mention the year, so I'll put "Not Listed".

Title is straightforward: "Securing Workstations and Personal Data".

Description needs a 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet talks about securing devices and data when using the dark web, so my description will reflect that.

Keywords should be up to five terms. From the content, relevant keywords are Dark Web, Deep Web, Workstation Security, Personal Data Protection, and Secure Browsing Tools.

Putting it all together, making sure each key is in quotes and values are properly formatted.

    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Securing Workstations and Personal Data",
  "description": "A tipsheet discussing the risks of using the dark web and deep web, and providing strategies for securing workstations and personal data.",
  "keywords": [
    "Dark Web",
    "Deep Web",
