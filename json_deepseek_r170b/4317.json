Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given input. Let me go through this step by step.

First, the user provided some text which seems to be an article about doctors cashing in on drug tests for seniors, with Medicare paying the bills. The main points are that doctors are conducting these tests and billing Medicare, which is leading to increased costs.

The JSON should have specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. 

Starting with "id": it's given as 4317, so that's straightforward.

Next, "authors". The text mentions "Doctors Cash In on Drug Tests for Seniors, and Medicare Pays the Bill" from WSJ (Wall Street Journal). However, there are no specific author names listed in the input. So each entry under authors should have name as null, email as null, and affiliation as "Wall Street Journal".

Moving on to "conference": The possible options are "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Looking at the text, I don't see any mention of a conference, so it's safe to set this as "Not Listed".

"year": The date in the input is 3/2/2015. That's clearly identifiable, so year should be 2015.

"title": From the text, the title is "Doctors Cash In on Drug Tests for Seniors, and Medicare Pays the Bill".

"description": Needs to be a concise summary. Something like: "The article discusses how doctors are increasingly conducting drug tests on seniors, with Medicare covering the costs, leading to financial gains for the physicians involved."

"keywords": I should pick up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Key points in the text include drug tests, Medicare, seniors, financial gain, medical billing.

Putting it all together, each field is mapped accordingly.

Here's a JSON object based on your request:

```json
{
  "id": "4317",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Wall Street Journal"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": 2015,
  "title": "Doctors Cash In on Drug Tests for Seniors, and Medicare Pays the Bill",
  "description": "The article discusses how doctors are increasingly conducting drug tests on seniors, with Medicare covering the costs, leading to financial gains for the physicians involved.",
  "keywords": [
    "drug tests",
    "Medicare",
    "seniors",
    "financial gain",
    "medical billing"
  ]
}
```
