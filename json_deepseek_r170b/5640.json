Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on this query. Let me break down what's being asked here.

First, the user provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference about digging into non-profits. The speaker is Brad Racino from inewsource. There are several slides with information on where to find 990 forms, supplemental filings, checking exempt status, knowing the different IRS forms, and a mention of non-profit shell games.

The user's instructions specify that I must produce only a JSON object describing this tipsheet. The keys required are id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. Each has specific formatting rules.

Starting with id: it should be 5640 as per the example.

Authors is a list where each entry has name, email, affiliation. Since Brad Racino's email isn't provided, I'll set it to null. His affiliation is inewsource, so that's clear.

Conference: It says "IRE" because that's the conference mentioned.

Year: The original didn't specify the year, so it should be "Not Listed".

Title: The title from the tipsheet is "Digging into Nonprofits".

Description needs to be a concise summary. I'll mention that it covers resources and methods for investigating non-profits, including 990 forms and government filings.

Keywords are up to five terms. From the content, relevant keywords include "nonprofits", "990 forms", "IRS", "financial statements", "investigative reporting".

I need to make sure all values are in English and keys are enclosed in quotes. Also, avoid making up any information; stick strictly to what's provided.

Double-checking the example response, it looks like they included everything correctly. I should follow that structure closely.
