Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's input. The instructions specify that the response must only include this JSON object without any additional explanation or formatting.

First, I'll parse the input provided. It starts with "Info merchants and influence peddlers: Tracking lobbyists, consultants and fund-raisers" by James Drew and Mike Wilkinson from The Blade. Their emails are given as jdrew@theblade.com and mwilkinson@theblade.com respectively. 

The tipsheet includes various resources like state campaign finance records, federal campaign finance records, political charities (527 money), federal contracts, open records laws, Ohio-specific sites, and the local courthouse. It also mentions using legal strategies when dealing with public records.

Now, mapping this to the required JSON structure:

- **id**: Given as T2737.
- **authors**: A list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. Both authors are from The Blade, so their affiliations are set accordingly.
- **conference**: Since IRE is mentioned in the context of conferences, it should be "IRE".
- **year**: The input doesn't specify a year, so it's "Not Listed".
- **title**: Provided as "Info merchants and influence peddlers: Tracking lobbyists, consultants and fund-raisers".
- **description**: A concise summary. It should mention tracking lobbyists using public records and legal strategies.
- **keywords**: Relevant terms are campaign finance, lobbyists, public records, federal contracts, and open government.

I need to ensure all values are in English and enclosed in quotes. Also, the keywords list shouldn't exceed five terms.

Double-checking everything: authors' details are correctly captured, conference is IRE, year isn't listed, title and description fit, and keywords are relevant without exceeding the limit.
