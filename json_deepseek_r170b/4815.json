Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given input. The user provided a tipsheet from an IRE conference titled "When PIOs fight back." 

First, I'll extract the necessary information. The id is 4815 as specified. Since there are no authors mentioned in the text, the authors list will be empty with null values for name, email, and affiliation.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's straightforward. The year is 2016 because the document is dated 8/4/2016. The title of the tipsheet is "When PIOs fight back."

For the description, it should be a concise summary. The text discusses how PIOs are becoming more involved in FOIA requests and suggests strategies for journalists dealing with pushback from PIOs. So I'll summarize that into one or two sentences.

Keywords need to be relevant and no more than five. From the content, terms like "PIOs," "FOIA," "journalists," "transparency," and "government accountability" seem appropriate. These capture the main themes without including conference or author names.

I'll structure all this into a JSON object, ensuring each key is correctly named and values are enclosed in quotes. I should double-check that there are no markdown elements and that everything adheres to proper JSON formatting.

```json
{
  "id": 4815,
  "authors": [],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2016,
  "title": "When PIOs fight back",
  "description": "Tipsheet discussing strategies for dealing with pushback from public information officers (PIOs) and handling FOIA requests.",
  "keywords": ["PIOs", "FOIA", "journalists", "transparency", "government accountability"]
}
```
