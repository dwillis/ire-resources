Alright, I need to create a JSON object from the provided tipsheet about integrating CAR into existing courses. The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, I'll note that the id is T2610 as specified. Next, looking at the authors section, Jeff South is mentioned along with his affiliation at VA Commonwealth University School of Mass Comm. There's no email provided, so that field will be null.

The conference is clearly stated as the 2006 CAR Conference, so I'll set the conference key to "Not Listed" since it's not one of the specified options (IRE, NICAR). The year is given as 2006 in the document.

For the title, it's "Integrating CAR into Existing Courses." The description needs to be a concise summary. I'll write that it discusses incorporating computer-assisted reporting skills across various journalism courses for better storytelling and precision.

Keywords should include terms like "CAR", "journalism education", "data analysis", "precision journalism", and "curriculum integration" â€“ making sure not to exceed five terms.

I need to structure all this into a JSON object with the specified keys, ensuring that all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, I'll verify that no made-up information is included; if any details aren't present, they remain null or as specified.

Finally, I'll format everything correctly without using markdown, just plain JSON. This should meet all the user's requirements accurately.
