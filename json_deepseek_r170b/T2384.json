Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given input about FOIA tips from Glenn Smith at The Post and Courier. Let me break down the requirements step by step.

First, I'll start by identifying each key needed: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as T2384, so that's straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors section. It should be a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. In the input, there's only one author mentionedâ€”Glenn Smith from The Post and Courier. His email isn't provided, so I'll leave it as null. Affiliation is clearly his employer, so that goes in.

For the conference, since the text doesn't specify which event this tipsheet is from, I'll default to "Not Listed". The year also isn't mentioned, so that will be "Not Listed" as well.

The title should capture the essence of the tips, so something like "Tips for Freedom of Information Act Requests" makes sense. 

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary in 1-2 sentences. I'll need to paraphrase the main points: asking for documents under FOIA, being prepared with requests, knowing what you're seeking, considering digital formats, verifying official denials, and understanding delays.

Keywords should include up to five terms relevant to the content but excluding the conference and authors. So, "FOIA", "Freedom of Information Act", "public records", "investigative reporting", and "transparency" are all good choices.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part correctly in JSON format, ensuring proper syntax with quotes around keys and values, commas where necessary, and correct data types for lists and strings.

```json
{
  "id": "T2384",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Tips for Freedom of Information Act Requests",
  "description": "A tipsheet providing advice on how to effectively use FOIA requests, including being prepared, knowing what you're looking for, and considering non-traditional documents.",
  "keywords": [
    "FOIA",
    "Freedom of Information Act",
    "public records",
    "investigative reporting",
    "transparency"
  ]
}
```
