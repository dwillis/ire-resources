Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let's go through each part step by step.

First, the id should be "Social_Media_Sleuthing_Feb20121" as specified. 

Next, looking at the authors. I see several names listed without emails or affiliations. For example, Doug Haddix is mentioned but no email or affiliation provided, so his entry will have name: null, email: null, and affiliation: null. Similarly, Paula Lavigne from ESPN has her affiliation, so that's straightforward.

The conference is clearly IRE since it's an IRE tipsheet. The year isn't explicitly stated, so it should be "Not Listed".

For the title, the main heading is "Social Media Sleuthing". 

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers using social media platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn for investigative reporting, finding sources, tracking individuals, etc. So I'll write that it's about leveraging these tools for journalism.

Keywords should include relevant terms: Social Media, Investigative Reporting, Sources, Surveillance, Online Search, Journalism Tools. I'll limit to five as instructed.

Now, structuring all this into a JSON object with appropriate keys and ensuring all values are in English and properly enclosed.
