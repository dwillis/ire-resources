Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about wildfires from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id is given as T2646, so that's straightforward. Next, the authors section requires a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. The provided text mentions Natalya Shulyakovskaya from The Orange County Register, along with her contact info. So I'll include her details, ensuring email and affiliation are correctly placed.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's set. For the year, since it's not specified in the input, I'll mark it as "Not Listed". The title should reflect the main topic, which is about preparing for wildfire season, so something like "Preparing for Wildfire Season" makes sense.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet focuses on advance preparation, resources, and data collection, so I'll craft a 1-2 sentence summary that captures these elements without getting too detailed.

Keywords are next. They should be relevant and limited to five. I'll go with "wildfires", "firefighting resources", "incident reports", "data tracking", and "emergency preparedness" as they cover the main points of the tipsheet.

Putting it all together, I structure each key properly in JSON format, ensuring that strings are enclosed in quotes and proper syntax is maintained. I also need to make sure there are no markdown elements and everything is clean and readable.
