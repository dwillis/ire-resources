Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided query. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the user wants a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference titled "Covering Congress from Outside the Beltway." The speaker is Tom Brune from Newsday at the 2018 IRE Conference.

The id should be "5725_3" as specified. 

Next, the authors section requires a list with each author's name, email, and affiliation. Since only Tom Brune is mentioned without an email, his entry will have name: "Tom Brune", email: null, and affiliation: "Newsday".

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that goes in. The year is given as 2018.

For the title, it's straightforward from the input: "Covering Congress from Outside the Beltway".

The description needs to be a concise summary of the text. It should explain how campaign finance reports can lead to stories about money influencing legislation, using the ambulance lobby example. I'll make sure it's 1-2 sentences and in simple terms.

Keywords are up to five relevant terms. The main points are campaign finance, Medicare payments, lobbying, Congress, and health care overhaul. These capture the essence without including the conference or authors.

I need to ensure all keys and values are in quotes, and there's no markdown formatting. Let me structure this correctly.
