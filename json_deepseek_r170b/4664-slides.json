Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to create a JSON object based on the provided input about a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user wants this response to only include the JSON object, but since they asked for a thinking process first, I'll outline my steps here.

First, I need to parse through the given slides and extract relevant information. The title of the presentation is "Web scraping without programming." The speakers are Robert Gebeloff from The New York Times and Tom Johnson with an email provided. Their affiliations can be inferred as their respective organizations since they're mentioned in the context.

The conference listed is NICAR Denver, which took place in March 2016, so that gives me the conference name and year. I need to summarize the content into a brief description. From the slides, it's about web scraping techniques without using programming, including tools like Chrome Table Capture, Import.IO, and handling large websites.

For keywords, I'll pick relevant terms from the content: "web scraping," "data extraction," "non-programming tools," "HTML to Excel," and "PDF extraction." These capture the essence of the presentation without overlapping with the conference or authors.

I should structure this into a JSON object with keys: id, authors (as an array), conference, year, title, description, keywords. Each author entry will have name, email, and affiliation. Affiliation is determined by their associated organization if not explicitly stated.

Now, putting it all together to form the correct JSON.

    }
