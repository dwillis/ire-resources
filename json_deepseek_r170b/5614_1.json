Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. The query provides detailed tips from an investigative reporter about conducting interviews. 

First, I'll identify the required keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

The ID is given as 5614_1. For authors, Linda Byron is listed with her email and affiliation. Since she's affiliated with UW Tacoma, that goes into the affiliation field. Her name isn't null because it's provided.

Conference should be "IRE" since it's from Investigative Reporters and Editors. The year is April 2019, so I'll use 2019 as the value.

The title is clearly stated as "THE ART OF THE INVESTIGATIVE INTERVIEW". 

For description, I need a concise summary in simple language. It should mention preparing for interviews with various sources like tipsters, victims, experts, etc., and include techniques for different types of interviews.

Keywords are up to five terms. I'll choose relevant ones: "investigative interviewing", "preparation", "techniques", "sources", "accountability".

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Now, putting it all together.
