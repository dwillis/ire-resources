Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Rob Barry at the Wall Street Journal. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking for the id. The user specified it should be 4411, so that's straightforward.

Next, authors. The main author is Rob Barry with his email and affiliation to WSJ. I'll list him as an object within the authors array.

Conference: Since this was from an IRE conference tipsheet, the value will be "IRE".

Year: Not explicitly mentioned in the text, so it's "Not Listed".

Title: The title of the tipsheet is "Policing the Police".

Description: Needs to be a concise summary. The text discusses methods for tracking police killings and issues with data sources. I'll phrase that clearly.

Keywords: Extract relevant terms like "police shootings", "data sources", "FBI", "CDC", and "BJS" as they are key topics covered.

Now, structuring all this into a JSON object without missing any keys or making up information.

```json
{
  "id": 4411,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Rob Barry",
      "email": "rob.barry@wsj.com",
      "affiliation": "Wall Street Journal"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Policing the Police",
  "description": "This tipsheet discusses methods for tracking and analyzing police killings, including accessing data from local departments and understanding the limitations of national repositories like the FBI's Supplementary Homicide Report and the CDC's National Vital Statistics System.",
  "keywords": [
    "police shootings",
    "data sources",
    "FBI",
    "CDC",
    "BJS"
  ]
}
```
