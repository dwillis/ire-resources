Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. First, let me parse through the user's instructions carefully.

The user provided specific keys for the JSON: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 4536. I need to extract each of these from the input text.

Looking at the input, the title is "Tips for Finding Hidden Datasets." The conference details show it's from IRE 2015 in Philadelphia. So, conference is "IRE" and year is 2015.

Next, authors are listed as Sarah Cohen, Brad Heath, Janet Roberts, with a moderator John Hillkirk. Each author has an email and affiliation. I'll structure each author object with name, email, and affiliation. For example, Sarah Cohen's email is sarah.cohen@nytimes.com, so her affiliation is "The New York Times." Similarly, Brad Heath and Janet Roberts are from USA Today and Thomson Reuters respectively.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about finding hidden datasets for data-driven stories, methods like FOIA requests, scraping data, and understanding information flows. So, I'll summarize that into 1-2 sentences.

For keywords, I need up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords could be "data journalism," "FOIA," "open records," "public datasets," and "investigative reporting."

I should ensure all values are in English unless otherwise noted and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, make sure not to invent any information; if something isn't present, leave it as null.

Putting it all together, the JSON structure should have each key filled accurately based on the input text.
