Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given text about Freelance Investigative Reporters and Editors (FIRE). Let me go through this step by step.

First, I'll identify the required keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is specified as 5659_1.

Next, for the authors section, the input doesn't mention any specific names. So each author entry will have name as null, and since there's no email or affiliation provided either, those will be null too.

The conference is mentioned in collaboration with IRE, so the conference key should be "IRE". The year isn't clearly stated in the text, so it'll be "Not Listed".

For the title, the main subject is FIRE's services and mission, so something like "Supporting Freelance Investigative Journalists" seems appropriate.

The description needs to be a concise summary. I'll mention how FIRE helps freelancers through their Virtual Newsroom and editorial consultancy, supported by organizations like Ford Foundation and Jonathan Logan Family Foundation, while maintaining editorial independence.

Now, the keywords should capture the essence without being too many. I'll include "investigative journalism", "freelance reporters", "Virtual Newsroom", "editorial consultancy", and "nonprofit funding".

Putting it all together in JSON format with proper syntax and structure.

  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Supporting Freelance Investigative Journalists",
  "description": "FIRE provides resources and support for freelance investigative journalists, offering services like the Virtual Newsroom and editorial consultancy to help produce high-impact stories.
