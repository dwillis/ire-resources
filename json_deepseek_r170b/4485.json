Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down the requirements step by step.

First, the structure should include specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is provided as 4485, so that's straightforward.

Looking at the tipsheet, the panel is titled "How to sort out science for your investigation." I'll use this as the title in my JSON. 

Next, the conference is clearly mentioned as IRE, so that's set. The year of the event is given as 2015, which will go into the year field.

For the authors section, the tipsheet lists Jeff Donn as a panelist. However, there's no email or affiliation provided for him. According to instructions, if these details aren't available, I should leave them as null. So, the authors array will have one object with name set to "Jeff Donn" and both email and affiliation as null.

The description needs to be a concise summary of the tipsheet content. The text lists various resources for finding scientific research and experts. I'll craft this into a simple sentence explaining that the tipsheet provides resources for locating and verifying scientific information.

Keywords are next. They should be relevant terms from the content, excluding conference names or authors. The main topics here are "scientific research," "investigation," "expert sources," "PubMed," and "Google Scholar." I'll list these as keywords, ensuring not to exceed five terms.

I need to ensure all keys and string values are in English and enclosed in double quotes. No markdown should be present in the final output, just a clean JSON structure.

Double-checking everything: id is correct, conference is IRE, year is 2015, title accurately reflects the panel name, description is a clear summary, authors only include Jeff Donn with nulls where info isn't available, and keywords are relevant without exceeding five.

I think that covers all requirements. Time to format this into proper JSON.

```json
{
  "id": 4485,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Jeff Donn",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2015,
  "title": "How to sort out science for your investigation",
  "description": "This tipsheet provides resources and methods for locating scientific research, identifying experts, and verifying sources.",
  "keywords": [
    "scientific research",
    "investigation",
    "expert sources",
    "PubMed",
    "Google Scholar"
  ]
}
```
