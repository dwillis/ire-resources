Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the tipsheet provided by CJ Sinner from the Star Tribune. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the ID is given as 4997. So that's straightforward. 

Next, for authors, there's only one author mentioned: CJ Sinner with an affiliation to the StarTribune. The email isn't provided, so it should be null. I'll structure this as a list with one object containing name, email, and affiliation.

The conference is IRE since it's from Investigative Reporters and Editors conferences.

Looking at the year, the text doesn't specify when the tipsheet was presented or published. So the year will be "Not Listed".

For the title, it's clearly stated as "Carto basics". 

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers preparing data for mapping, geocoding options, differences between datasets and maps in Carto, and publishing tips. I'll condense that into 1-2 sentences.

Keywords should include terms like "Carto", "mapping", "data visualization", "geocoding", and "GIS". These capture the main topics without including the conference or author names.

Putting it all together, each key is filled appropriately with the information extracted from the tipsheet.

```json
{
  "id": 4997,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "CJ Sinner",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "StarTribune"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Carto basics",
  "description": "A tipsheet covering the basics of using Carto for mapping, including data preparation, geocoding options, and publishing tips.",
  "keywords": [
    "Carto",
    "mapping",
    "data visualization",
    "geocoding",
    "GIS"
  ]
}
```
