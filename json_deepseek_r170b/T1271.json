Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided input. Let me start by reading through the entire content carefully.

The document begins with "International resources handout" which seems like it's a guide or tips for accessing various international resources. It lists different sections like news sources, governments, legal resources, statistics, etc., each with links to websites. 

Looking at the top, I see it mentions "Tips for using International Legal sites" and references NYU Law Library and Washburn University School of Law. There's also a section on evaluating international legal sites from llrx.com.

Now, focusing on the user's query: they want me to create a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. 

First, the id is given as T1271, so that's straightforward. Next are the authors. The input doesn't mention any authors by name, only organizations like NYU and Washburn University. Since there are no individual names listed, I'll set each author's name to null. Their affiliations will be the respective universities.

For the conference key, looking at the context, this document seems related to a journalism or investigative reporting conference, possibly IRE (Investigative Reporters and Editors) since it's about resources which are commonly discussed there. NICAR is another possibility, but without specific mentions, I'll go with "IRE".

The year isn't explicitly stated in the provided text. Thereâ€™s no date mentioned anywhere, so I have to set year as "Not Listed". 

The title should be derived from the content. The first line says "International resources handout", which seems appropriate.

For the description, it needs a concise summary. The document is a guide listing various international resources across different categories like legal, statistics, etc., intended for research purposes. So I can write something like: "A guide to accessing international resources including news, governments, legal information, and statistics."

Keywords are next. They should be no more than five terms. From the content, relevant keywords could be "international resources", "research", "legal", "statistics", "government". These capture the essence without overlapping with conference or authors.

Putting it all together, I need to structure this into a JSON object. Each key needs to be in quotes, and values also in quotes where applicable. The authors array will have two objects since there are two universities mentioned as affiliations.

I should make sure that all data types are correct: authors is an array of objects with name, email, and affiliation. Since names aren't provided, they're null, emails are also null because not given, and affiliations are the respective schools.

Double-checking everything to ensure I didn't miss any details or add anything extra. The description is brief and in simple language as requested. Keywords are limited to five relevant terms.
