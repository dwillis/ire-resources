Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down each requirement step by step.

First, the id is provided as 4970, so that's straightforward. Next, looking at the authors section: the main author mentioned is Dinah Voyles Pulver. Her email and affiliation are listed as dinah.pulver@news-jrnl.com and @dinahvp on Twitter. Since her affiliation isn't explicitly stated next to her name but she's associated with a news organization, I'll use "News-Journal" from her email domain.

The conference is clearly indicated as IRE, so that goes into the conference field. The year isn't provided in the text, so it should be set to "Not Listed".

For the title, the document starts with "EXCEL FORMULAS It’s not as hard as it looks!" which makes a suitable title.

The description needs to be concise, summarizing the content. The tipsheet covers various Excel formulas and functions for data cleaning and analysis, so I'll phrase that into a clear sentence.

Keywords should include relevant terms related to Excel functions mentioned: SUM, TRIM, PROPER, YEAR, RIGHT, LEFT, MID, CONCATENATE, TEXT TO COLUMNS, and PERCENT CHANGE. However, since the maximum is five, I'll select the most essential ones like SUM, TRIM, PROPER, YEAR, and TEXT TO COLUMNS.

Putting it all together, I structure each part accordingly ensuring all keys are in quotes and values follow the specified format.
