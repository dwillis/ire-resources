Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, the user provided a detailed set of instructions along with some example responses. They want the response to be only a JSON object without any markdown formatting. The id is fixed at 3986, so that's straightforward.

Looking at the tipsheet content, the title is "Make Your Investigations Mobile" and it's presented by Jeff Taylor from IndyStar/Indianapolis Star. So I'll list him as an author with his name and affiliation, leaving email null since it's not provided.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's set. The year isn't mentioned in the text, so according to instructions, it should be "Not Listed".

For the description, I need a concise summary of 1-2 sentences. The tipsheet talks about making investigations mobile from the start, emphasizing teamwork and digital planning. So I'll craft a brief summary highlighting these points.

Keywords should include relevant terms without mentioning the conference or authors. The content covers mobile journalism, teamwork, digital storytelling, interactive elements, and promotion strategies. I'll select up to five of these that best represent the tipsheet.

I also need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. No markdown is allowed, so just plain JSON.

Putting it all together, I structure each key as per instructions: id, authors (as an array with name, email, affiliation), conference, year, title, description, keywords.

Double-checking everything: Jeff Taylor's details are correct, the summary captures the essence, and keywords are relevant. All values are properly formatted without markdown.

I think that covers all requirements. Time to write the JSON.
