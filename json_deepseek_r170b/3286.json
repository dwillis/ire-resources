Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me start by identifying each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, the id is provided as 3286. That's straightforward.

Next, for the authors, I see three names with emails and affiliations. Andy Hall is from Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism, David Cay Johnston is an author without a specific affiliation listed, so I'll leave that null. Norberto Santana is a freelancer, so his affiliation will be "Freelancer". Each author object should have name, email, and affiliation.

The conference is clearly stated as the annual IRE conference in Baltimore, so the conference key will be "IRE".

The year is given as 2009, specifically June 12, 2009, so I'll use 2009 for the year.

The title of the tipsheet seems to be "Back to basics: Finding stories in what is readily available but rarely examined". That's a bit long, but it accurately reflects the content.

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet provides ideas for investigative stories using easily accessible information. So, something like: "This tipsheet offers ideas for investigative stories using readily available but often overlooked public records and data sources."

Now, keywords. I'll extract relevant terms from the content, excluding the conference name and authors. Possible keywords are public records, investigative reporting, local government, financial disclosure, lawsuits, demographics, prison populations, stimulus spending, and education.

I should limit it to five, so let's pick the most significant ones: "public records", "investigative reporting", "local government", "financial disclosure", and "lawsuits".

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part carefully, ensuring proper JSON syntax with all keys and values in quotes.
