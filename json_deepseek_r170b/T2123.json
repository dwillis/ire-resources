Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. Let me see what they're asking for.

First, the user provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference titled "Investigating the Past: Tips for Revisiting Old Criminal Cases" by Phoebe Zerwick of the Winston-Salem Journal. They want this information structured into a specific JSON format with keys like id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The user also provided an example response, so I can use that as a template. Let me break down each part:

1. **id**: It should be "T2123".
2. **authors**: A list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. Since only Phoebe Zerwick is mentioned, her details go here. Her email is provided, so that's included, and the affiliation is Winston-Salem Journal.
3. **conference**: The example shows it's "IRE", which makes sense since it's from an IRE conference.
4. **year**: In the example, it's 2004, which is clearly stated in the input.
5. **title**: The title of the tipsheet, which is given as "INVESTIGATING THE PAST: TIPS FOR REVISITING OLD CRIMINAL CASES".
6. **description**: A concise summary of 1-2 sentences. I'll need to capture the main points about revisiting old cases and the example provided.
7. **keywords**: Up to five relevant terms, excluding conference and authors. From the content, keywords like "criminal cases", "investigative reporting", "DNA testing", "justice system", and "journalism" seem appropriate.

Now, I need to ensure all these points are correctly formatted in JSON. Also, make sure that values are enclosed in quotes and that the structure follows the example exactly. No markdown should be present as per the user's instruction.

Let me put it all together step by step:

- Start with the id.
- Create an authors array with one object containing Phoebe's details.
- Set conference to "IRE".
- Year is 2004.
- Title is straightforward from the input.
- Description should succinctly explain the tipsheet's purpose and example.
- Keywords are selected based on relevance.

I think that covers all required fields. I'll double-check each part to ensure accuracy, especially the email and affiliation since they're crucial for the authors' details.
