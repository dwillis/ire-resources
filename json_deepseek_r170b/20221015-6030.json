Alright, I need to help this user by creating a JSON object from their provided text. Let me read through their instructions carefully.

The user wants a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. They specified the response should only be a JSON object with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The ID is given as 6030, so that's straightforward.

Looking at the text, I see three presenters: Carrie Levine from the Center for Public Integrity, Robert Maguire from CREW, and Anna Massoglia from OpenSecrets. For each author, I need to extract their name, email, and affiliation. Some emails are provided, but affiliations are clear next to their names.

The conference is IRE 2020, so that's easy for the conference key. The year is clearly listed as 2020. The title of the tipsheet seems to be "Tips for Uncovering Dark Money."

For the description, it needs a concise summary. The text discusses resources and records for tracking dark money in elections. I'll need to condense this into one or two sentences.

Keywords should include dark money, nonprofits, LLCs, campaign finance, and IRS filings. These are central themes from the provided tipsheet.

I also have to ensure all values are in English and properly quoted. If any information isn't present, like an email for Carrie Levine, I'll set that field to null.

Now, putting it all together into a JSON structure with the specified keys and ensuring correct formatting.
