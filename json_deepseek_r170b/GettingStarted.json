Alright, I need to create a JSON object from the given tipsheet. The user provided specific instructions on how to structure it with keys like id, authors, conference, year, etc.

First, the ID should be "GettingStarted". That's straightforward.

Next, the authors are Jaimi Dowdell from IRE, Rob O’Dell from Arizona Daily Star, and Angélica Peralta Ramos from LA NACION. So each author will have a name and affiliation. Emails aren't provided, so they'll be null.

The conference is mentioned as IRE in the text, so that's set. The year isn't listed anywhere, so it remains "Not Listed".

For the title, the tipsheet is titled "Digging deep with data journalism". 

The description needs to be a concise summary. Looking at the content, it focuses on using data for investigative reporting, starting small, and building skills. So I'll craft a 1-2 sentence summary that captures this essence.

Keywords should include relevant terms without mentioning the conference or authors. Data journalism, CAR, Excel, SQL, and Access are key here.

Putting it all together, each part is addressed step by step to ensure compliance with the user's instructions.
