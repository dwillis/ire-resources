Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given input about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference session. The user has provided specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, I'll identify the id as "T1784" since that's specified. Next, for authors, there's only Jim Hopkins from USA TODAY with his email and phone number. I need to structure this as a list of objects, each having name, email, and affiliation. Since the affiliation is USA TODAY, I'll include that.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE", so that goes in the conference key. The year is 2003 because the event took place in March 2003. 

For the title, it's given as "Negotiating for a government database". The description should be a concise summary. I'll write that it covers when to seek government databases and how to request them.

Keywords are up to five terms. I'll pick the main points: government databases, public records, data requests, open-records laws, and investigative reporting.

I need to make sure all keys are enclosed in quotes and values are in English. No markdown or extra text, just a clean JSON object.
