Okay, I need to create a JSON object from the provided tipsheet based on the user's specifications. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id should be 5596 as given. Next, authors: looking at the text, there are no specific author names mentioned, so the authors array will have elements with name set to null. The email and affiliation can also be null since there's no info provided.

The conference is either IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed. The tipsheet mentions @IRE_NICAR and training@ire.org, so it's safe to classify this as an IRE conference. The year isn't explicitly stated, so it remains "Not Listed".

For the title, the main heading is about turning data into TV & online gold, which seems fitting.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers using data in storytelling, tools for interactives, and tips for audience engagement. So I'll craft a 1-2 sentence summary that captures these elements without getting too detailed.

Keywords should include data journalism, interactives, online presentation, data analysis, and visualization. These terms are central to the content and don't exceed five.

Putting it all together, I structure each key as per instructions, ensuring proper formatting with quotes and correct data types.

```json

  "id": 5596,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Turning Data into TV & Online Gold",
  "description": "This tipsheet provides guidance on using data in storytelling, tools to build online interactives, and tips for making effective visualizations that engage audiences.",
  "keywords": [
    "data journalism",
    "interactives",
    "online presentation",
    "data analysis",
    "visualization"
  ]
}
```
