Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let's break down what's required step by step.

First, looking at the input provided, it seems to be a tipsheet titled "Investigating Job Subsidies, True Costs & Campaign $ Connections" presented by Greg LeRoy from Good Jobs First at the IRE conference in San Antonio on June 21, 2013. There's also mention of Phil Mattera, who is the Research Director at Good Jobs First and a former business journalist.

The JSON structure needs to include specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. Each of these has certain requirements.

Starting with 'id', it should be "3981_1" as per the instructions.

Next, 'authors' is a list where each element has 'name', 'email', and 'affiliation'. The primary author here is Greg LeRoy. His email isn't listed in the input, so that will be null. His affiliation is Good Jobs First. Phil Mattera is another author mentioned; his email is also not provided, and he's affiliated with Good Jobs First as well. So both authors have their names and affiliations filled out, but emails are null.

The 'conference' key should be "IRE" since the tipsheet was presented at an IRE conference in San Antonio.

The 'year' is clearly listed as 2013, so that's straightforward.

For the 'title', it's given as "Investigating Job Subsidies, True Costs & Campaign $ Connections".

The 'description' needs to be a concise summary of 1-2 sentences. The tipsheet discusses how to investigate job subsidies, their true costs, and connections to campaign finances, providing resources and methods for journalists.

Finally, the 'keywords' should be up to five terms that capture the essence without including the conference or authors. From the content, relevant keywords would be "job subsidies", "corporate welfare", "economic development", "campaign finance", and "investigative journalism".

Putting it all together, each part of the JSON is filled out based on the information extracted from the tipsheet.
