Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given input. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the id is specified as 4073, so that goes straight into the JSON.

Looking at the text, I see mentions of authors like John Keefe and Jenny Ye. However, their emails aren't provided, so I'll leave those null. The affiliation for John should be "WNYC" since it's mentioned in the context of his work there.

The conference is NICAR because the input has several references to NICAR sessions and examples from WNYC, which often present at NICAR. The year isn't explicitly stated, so I'll mark that as "Not Listed".

For the title, since none is given, I'll use null. The description needs to be a concise summary. The text talks about mapping tools for journalists, especially using census data and examples like median income maps. So, I'll write it as a 1-2 sentence overview of that.

Keywords should exclude the conference and authors but include relevant terms. "Mapping", "Census Data", "Journalism Tools", "Choropleth Maps" are all mentioned or implied, so those fit well as keywords.

Putting it all together, I structure each part carefully to ensure nothing is missed.

```json
{
  "id": 4073,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": null,
  "description": "A discussion of tools and techniques for creating maps with census data, including examples from WNYC's coverage of median income and inequality in the U.S.",
  "keywords": [
    "Mapping",
    "Census Data",
    "Journalism Tools",
    "Choropleth Maps"
  ]
}
```
