Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, they want a JSON response only. The keys required are id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. They also specified that the id should be 5144, which is straightforward.

Looking at the input provided, it's from the IRE-Phoenix conference's Breaking News panel on June 22, 2017. The speaker mentioned is @chuckgoudieabc7, but there's no explicit name provided in the text. So, for authors, I should list each speaker with their details. Since only the Twitter handle is given without a full name, I'll set "name" to null and use the handle as the affiliation if possible.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE-Phoenix, so under "conference," it's definitely an IRE event. The year is given as 2017, so that's easy to fill in.

For the title, "Breaking News Triage" seems appropriate based on the content. The description needs to be a concise summaryâ€”maybe something about strategies for covering breaking news effectively, considering evaluation, prioritization, and treatment across media platforms.

Keywords should include terms like "breaking news," "triage," "investigative journalism," "media strategy," and "journalism tips." I'll make sure these are no more than five and exclude the conference name and authors as per instructions.

I also need to ensure that all keys and values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. No markdown, just plain JSON. Let me structure this step by step to avoid missing anything.

```json
{
  "id": 5144,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "@chuckgoudieabc7"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2017,
  "title": "Breaking News Triage",
  "description": "A tipsheet from the IRE-Phoenix conference discussing strategies for evaluating, prioritizing, and treating breaking news stories effectively.",
  "keywords": [
    "breaking news",
    "investigative journalism",
    "media strategy",
    "triage"
  ]
}
```
