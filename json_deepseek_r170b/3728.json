Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's instructions. The input provided seems to be from a slide or presentation about investigative journalism tools and techniques.

First, looking at the content: there are several sections with tips and resources for journalists. These include using government databases, social media tools like Geofeedia and OpenStatusSearch, image searching with Google Images, people finders, web archives, and others. It ends with a Q&A section mentioning authors Keli Rabon and Stephen Stock from specific news organizations.

The user wants the JSON to have keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. 

ID is given as 3728. 

Authors are in a list, each with name, email, affiliation. Since emails aren't provided, they'll be null. Affiliation should use the news organization mentioned, so Keli Rabon from KMGH, Denver and Stephen Stock from NBC Bay Area.

Conference: The text doesnâ€™t mention IRE or NICAR explicitly, so it's "Not Listed".

Year is not specified, so also "Not Listed".

Title: It seems to be about investigating daily news stories, so the title could be that.

Description needs a 1-2 sentence summary. It's about tools and techniques for investigative journalism.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. So maybe "investigative journalism", "tools", "techniques", "journalism resources".

Putting it all together, I structure the JSON accordingly.

```json
{
  "id": "3728",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "KMGH, Denver"
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "NBC Bay Area"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigating Daily News Stories",
  "description": "A presentation on tools and techniques for investigative journalism, including resources like government databases, social media tools, and people finders.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative journalism",
    "tools",
    "techniques",
    "journalism resources"
  ]
}
```
