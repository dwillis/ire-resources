Alright, let me tackle this query step by step. The user provided a news article about Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner renting a house, along with instructions to create a specific JSON object from it.

First, I need to identify the required keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 5185. 

Next, for the authors section, the article lists Mark Maremont and Jim Bell. Wait, no, looking again, the byline says "Mark Maremont" and mentions Jim Bell in the text but he's a real-estate agent, not an author. So only Mark Maremont is the author here. His email isn't provided, so I'll leave it null. Since the article is from The Wall Street Journal, that will be his affiliation.

Conference needs to be one of "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". There's no mention of a conference in the text, so it should be "Not Listed". 

The year is 2017 as per the date in the article. 

Title is straightforward: "Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner’s Rental Deal Comes Under Scrutiny."

Description must be a concise summary. The key points are Ivanka and Kushner paying $15k/month rent, owned by Andrónico Luksic, who has a mining dispute with the U.S., and both parties claim it's unrelated.

Keywords should be up to five terms. I'll pick "Ivanka Trump", "Jared Kushner", "rental property", "Andrónico Luksic", and "mining dispute" as they capture the essence without including authors or conferences.

Putting it all together, ensuring correct formatting with quotes around keys and values, proper use of null where info isn't available.
