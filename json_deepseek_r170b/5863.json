Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given input. Let me read through everything carefully.

First, I see that Rachel Glickhouse from ProPublica presented at NICAR/IRE 2019 about crowd-powered collaborations. The title is "How to build a crowd-powered collaboration." 

The description should be a short summary. Maybe something like: "A session on creating collaborative journalism projects involving audiences for data collection and reporting."

For keywords, I'll pick relevant terms like "collaborative journalism," "crowdsourcing," "data collection," "investigative reporting," and "audience engagement."

Authors are straightforwardâ€”only Rachel Glickhouse is listed. Her email and affiliation should be included if available. The email is provided as rachel.glickhouse@propublica.org, so I'll add that.

The conference is NICAR since it's part of the event name. Year is 2019 as given.

Putting it all together, making sure to structure everything correctly with proper JSON syntax and ensuring all fields are enclosed in quotes.
