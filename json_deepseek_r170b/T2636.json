Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON, including certain keys and constraints.

First, I'll start by identifying each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. 

The id is straightforward; it's given as "T2636". 

Next, for the authors section, I see that M.J. Crowley is listed with an email (moose@starledger.com) and affiliation as The Star-Ledger. Since there are no other authors mentioned, this will be a list with a single object containing name, email, and affiliation.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE". 

Looking at the year, it's not explicitly provided in the text snippet, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

The title of the tipsheet is "Google Help" based on the content provided. 

For the description, I need a concise 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet covers various Google tools like calculators, maps, phone directories, and more, aimed at helping journalists. So, I'll craft a brief summary that encapsulates this.

Regarding keywords, they should be relevant to the content but not include the conference or authors. Appropriate keywords might be "Google tools", "journalist resources", "search techniques", etc., keeping it to no more than five terms.

Now, putting all these elements together into a JSON structure while ensuring proper formatting and handling any missing information appropriately.
