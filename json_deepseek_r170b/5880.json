Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided input. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking for the ID: The user specified it as 5880, so that's straightforward.

Next, identifying authors. There are two main sections with author information. Zaneta Lowe is listed with her email and affiliation WREG-TV. Brian M. Rosenthal is from The New York Times. I'll list both in an array under "authors," each having their respective details.

The conference name is clearly mentioned as IRE Conference 2019, so the conference key will be "IRE" and the year is 2019.

For the title, it's given as "How to Organize Your Reporting (and your life)" repeated for both authors, so I'll use that once in the JSON.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The text covers tips on organizing reporting workflows using tools and methods, so I'll phrase that into a clear sentence or two.

Keywords should be up to five terms. From the content, "productivity," "organization," "reporting tools," "workflow management," and "journalism" seem relevant.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, since there are no non-English parts, everything stays in English.

Putting it all together now.
