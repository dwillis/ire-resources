Okay, I need to create a JSON object from the given input based on specific instructions. The user provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference in Fort Worth, June 2006, by David Cay Johnston. 

First, the id is T2694 as per the example. Next, authors should be a list with each author having name, email, and affiliation. Here, only David Cay Johnston is listed with his email and affiliation as The New York Times. So I'll include that.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE @ Ft Worth June 2006, so conference key will be "IRE". The year is 2006 since it's explicitly mentioned.

For the title, the tipsheet is titled "Is There a Book In Your Investigation?" which I'll use. 

Description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet helps reporters turn investigations into books by providing guidance on abstracts, proposals, and work plans. So I'll phrase that in simple terms.

Keywords should exclude conference and authors but include relevant topics. From the content, the keywords would be investigation, book writing, journalism, proposal development, and work planning.

Putting it all together, I structure the JSON with these keys and values ensuring proper formatting and English language usage.
