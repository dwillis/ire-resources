Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, the id is straightforward—4634 as specified.

Next, looking at the authors section. There are two presenters: Jaimi Dowdell with affiliation IRE/NICAR and Madison Feller from the University of Missouri. Since their emails aren't provided, those will be null.

The conference is clearly IRE since that's mentioned in the text.

For the year, the tipsheet references CAR 2016, so the year should be 2016.

The title is given as "What the Hell is D3? And all the other questions you’re afraid to ask".

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet explains how to use the conference app to find sessions and mentions specific R classes, so I'll summarize that.

Keywords should include terms like D3, conference app, R programming language, data visualization, since these are relevant without including the conference or authors.

I think that's all covered. Let me structure this into JSON.

```json
{
  "id": 4634,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Jaimi Dowdell",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "IRE/NICAR"
    },
    {
      "name": "Madison Feller",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "University of Missouri"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2016,
  "title": "What the Hell is D3? And all the other questions you’re afraid to ask",
  "description": "A guide on using the conference mobile app to find sessions and specific R classes.",
  "keywords": ["D3", "conference app", "R programming language", "data visualization"]
}
```
