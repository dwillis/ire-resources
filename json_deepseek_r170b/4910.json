Alright, I'm looking at this user query where they want me to create a JSON object based on their specific instructions. The input provided seems to be from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. 

First, the id is given as 4910, so that's straightforward. Next, the authors section requires some attention. They mentioned not making up names and leaving them null if none are listed. Since the original text doesn't provide any author names, I'll set "name" to null for both entries. The email and affiliation can also be null as there's no additional info provided.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's set. The year isn't mentioned anywhere, so it defaults to "Not Listed". For the title, I notice it's about breaking news and background checks in criminal investigations, which makes a suitable title.

The description needs to be concise, summarizing the tipsheet's focus on immediate reporting via social media and thorough background checks using tools like Nexis-Lexis. That should fit into 1-2 sentences.

Keywords are limited to five. The main points from the tipsheet include breaking news, social media, criminal investigations, public records, and law enforcement. These are all relevant and within the limit.

I need to ensure that all keys are enclosed in quotes and values are in English since the original text is in English. Also, I should avoid adding any extra information beyond what's provided to stay accurate.
