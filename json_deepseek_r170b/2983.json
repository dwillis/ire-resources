Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. The input provided seems to be tips for conducting international investigations from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. 

First, let me parse each point given by the user. They want specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. 

The ID is 2983 as specified. Next, authors are listed with name, email, affiliation. In the input, I don't see any author names mentioned, so authors should be an empty list.

Conference is either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". The content references an IRE conference, so I'll set it to "IRE".

Year isn't provided in the text, so it's "Not Listed".

Title needs to reflect the content. The tips are about conducting international investigations, so a suitable title would be "Conducting International Investigations".

Description should be a 1-2 sentence summary. The text offers practical advice on gathering information abroad, so I'll summarize that.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the content: International investigations, fixers, government records, local media, persistence.

Now, structuring all this into JSON with proper syntax and ensuring all values are in English.

```json
{
  "id": 2983,
  "authors": [],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Conducting International Investigations",
  "description": "Tipsheet provides practical advice for conducting international investigations, including research strategies, working with fixers and translators, accessing government records, and connecting with local media.",
  "keywords": [
    "International investigations",
    "fixers",
    "government records",
    "local media",
    "persistence"
  ]
}
```
