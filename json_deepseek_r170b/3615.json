Okay, so I need to create a JSON object from this tipsheet provided by Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE). Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the ID is given as 3615. That's straightforward. Next, the authors section. The text mentions Mark Sableman. His email and affiliation are listed: msableman@thompsoncoburn.com and Thompson Coburn LLP. So I'll include him with these details.

The conference is clearly an IRE event since it's from their tipsheet. The year isn't explicitly mentioned, so I'll put "Not Listed". The title of the tipsheet is "Data Privacy Scorecard: What To Watch in 2012".

For the description, I need a concise summary. It should mention that it's about monitoring privacy rules and regulations from different sources like industry, FTC, Executive Branch, and Congress.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Relevant terms here would be "data privacy", "regulations", "self-regulation", "Do Not Track", and "opt-in".

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON accordingly.
