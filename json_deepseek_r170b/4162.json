Alright, let's break down how I arrived at the provided JSON object based on the user's query and the input data.

First, I read through the user's instructions carefully to understand what they needed. They wanted a JSON response describing a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The input was a URL linking to some information about tools for journalists. 

I started by visiting the provided URL, but it seems to be a bit.ly link that redirects somewhere else. Since I can't access external links directly, I relied on the text that followed in the query, which outlined five tools presented at an IRE conference.

The user specified several keys for the JSON object: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. They also mentioned that the id should be 4162. 

Looking at the input, the presentation was titled "5 great tools for journalists in 50 minutes" by Matt Carroll from MIT Media Center. His contact information included an email and affiliation. I extracted his name, email, and set the affiliation to "MIT Media Center" since that's where he's based.

Next, I determined the conference type. Since it was presented at an IRE event, I set the conference field to "IRE". The year wasn't explicitly mentioned in the input, so I defaulted to "Not Listed".

For the title and description, I used the provided title and crafted a concise summary highlighting that the session offered an overview of five tools rather than deep dives. This aligns with what Matt Carroll mentioned in his introduction.

Keywords were selected based on the tool names: Google Drive, DocumentCloud, Census Reporter, NICAR listserv, and Google Fusion Tables. I made sure to keep it to a maximum of five terms, excluding any redundant terms like the conference name or author's name.

I also ensured that all values were in English and properly enclosed in quotes as per JSON standards. Each key was carefully mapped from the input data to ensure accuracy.

Finally, I reviewed the structure to make sure it met the user's specifications exactly, without adding any extra information beyond what was provided.
