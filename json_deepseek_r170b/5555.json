Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from Wendy Saltzman's presentation at an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down each step carefully.

First, the id is straightforwardâ€”5555 as specified.

Next, looking at authors: The primary author is Wendy Saltzman. Her email is provided (Wendy@PhillyPowerMedia.com), and her affiliation is Philly Power Media. There's no other author mentioned, so the list will only have one entry with these details.

The conference is IRE since that's where the tipsheet is from.

Year isn't explicitly stated in the text, so it should be "Not Listed".

For the title, the tipsheet is titled "The Art of the Interview".

Description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers preparation, handling sources, interview requests, and best practices like using multiple cameras and ensuring safety. So I'll phrase that into one or two sentences.

Keywords should include terms from the content: Preparation, Sources, Interviews, Journalism Best Practices, Compelling Storytelling. That's five relevant keywords without including the conference name or author.

I need to ensure all keys are in English and enclosed in quotes. No markdown, just plain JSON structure.
