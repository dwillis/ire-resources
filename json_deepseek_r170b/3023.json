Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. The input provided is from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. 

First, I'll identify the required keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The id is given as 3023. Next, looking at the authors section, there are three panelists mentioned: Tommy Kaas, Lise Olsen, and David McKie. Each author should be an object with name, email, and affiliation. For Tommy Kaas, only his name and affiliation (Kaas & Mulvad) are listed; no email is provided. Similarly, Lise Olsen's affiliation is the Houston Chronicle, but her email isn't given. David McKie has all details: name, email, and affiliation with CBC.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE in Houston from Feb 28-Mar 2, 2008, so the conference key is "IRE" and the year is 2008. The title of the panel is "Global data for local stories."

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet lists various Canadian databases across health, transportation, etc., so the description should reflect that it's a guide to these databases for journalists.

Keywords should be no more than five terms, excluding conference and authors. Relevant keywords are Canada, databases, journalism resources, Health Canada, and access to information.

I'll structure each part accordingly, ensuring all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes.
