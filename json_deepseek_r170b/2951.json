Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has provided specific instructions, which I should follow carefully.

First, I'll identify each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 2951. 

Next, for the authors section, I need to list all contributors with their name, email, and affiliation. In the input, Mark Lodato is listed as the News Director & Professor of Practice at Cronkite School of Journalism, along with his contact info. So, his details are straightforward. There's also mention of Morgan Loew from KPHO-TV, who contributed some tips. Ismael Estrada from CNN is another author mentioned. I should include all three as separate authors.

The conference is clearly stated as the 2007 IRE National Conference in Phoenix, Arizona, so the conference key will be "IRE" and the year is 2007.

The title of the session is "Feeding the Beast: Strategies for Investigations at Local Stations."

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet provides strategies for investigative reporters to integrate into daily news operations, suggesting collaboration and quick-turn stories. So, I'll craft a brief sentence capturing that essence.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking through the content, relevant keywords might include "investigative reporting," "local stations," "collaboration," "quick-turn stories," and "daily news integration."

I must ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Each key in the JSON should also be in quotes as per the instructions.

Double-checking to make sure I didn't miss any authors or details, it seems I have everything covered.
