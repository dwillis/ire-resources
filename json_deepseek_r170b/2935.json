Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let's break down the task step by step.

First, the structure of the JSON is specified with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is already provided as 2935, so I can start there.

Looking at the input text, I see that the tipsheet is titled "CONFRONTATION / SPONTANEOUS INTERVIEW TIPSHEET". That will be the value for the "title" key.

Next, under authors, there are three people listed: Tom Merriman, Lea Thompson, and Nicole Vap. Each has their contact information and affiliations. I need to create an array of author objects with name, email, and affiliation.

For each author:
- Tom Merriman is affiliated with WJW-Cleveland, so his details are straightforward.
- Lea Thompson's affiliation is listed as ThomThom Media.
- Nicole Vap is from KUSA-Denver.

I should structure each author object accordingly. Their emails are provided, but if any were missing, I would set email to null.

The conference is clearly an IRE event since it's from Investigative Reporters and Editors, so the "conference" key will be "IRE". The year isn't mentioned in the text, so I'll mark that as "Not Listed".

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet provides advice on conducting confrontational or spontaneous interviews, emphasizing planning, fairness, and legal considerations. I'll condense this into 1-2 sentences.

Keywords should be relevant to the content without including the conference name or authors. Terms like "confrontation", "interview techniques", "journalism ethics", "public property", and "hidden cameras" seem appropriate.

Putting it all together, each part of the JSON is filled out based on the information extracted from the tipsheet.
