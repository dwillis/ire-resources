Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down what's needed.

First, the id is given as 5533. That’s straightforward.

Looking at the authors section: Megan Luther and Cody Winchester are listed with their emails and affiliations. Megan is from @InvestigateTV, so I'll note that as her affiliation. Cody is affiliated with IRE/NICAR. There's also a mention of @MeganLuther and @cody_winchester on Twitter, but since the instructions specify not to make up names and only use what's provided, their emails are null unless specified. The original text doesn't provide emails, so those fields will be null.

The conference is clearly IRE, as it’s from an IRE event in New Orleans (NOLA). The year isn’t explicitly mentioned, so it should be "Not Listed".

For the title, the tipsheet covers source development strategies, so I'll name it "Source Development Strategies".

The description needs to be a concise summary. It's about building and maintaining sources, including approaches like being genuine and handling whistleblowers, so I can write that in one or two sentences.

Keywords are next. From the content, relevant terms include source development, whistleblowers, journalism ethics, cultivating sources, and investigative reporting. These capture the essence without exceeding five terms.

I'll structure all these elements into a JSON object with appropriate keys as specified.

    }
  ],
