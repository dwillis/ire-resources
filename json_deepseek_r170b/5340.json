Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tip sheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let's break down what's needed.

First, the structure should have specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is given as 5340. 

Looking at the authors section, there are two speakers listed: Regina Compton and Derek Eder. Their emails and affiliations aren't provided, so I'll set those to null.

The conference is NICAR18, which stands for the 2018 NICAR Conference. So, the conference key should be "NICAR" and the year would be 2018 since it's clearly stated as March 8, 2018.

The title of the tip sheet is "Maps Made Easy - Agenda & Tip Sheet." 

For the description, I need a concise summary. The session covers creating interactive maps using Google Fusion Tables, including examples and resources. So, something like: "Learn how to create interactive maps with Google Fusion Tables, covering basics, advanced techniques, and additional mapping resources."

Keywords should be up to five terms. From the content, relevant terms are "Google Fusion Tables," "geocoding," "choropleth map," "KML," and "mapping tools." These capture the main topics without including the conference or authors.

Now, putting it all together in JSON format with proper syntax.

```json
{
  "id": 5340,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Regina Compton",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    },
    {
      "name": "Derek Eder",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": 2018,
  "title": "Maps Made Easy - Agenda & Tip Sheet",
  "description": "Learn how to create interactive maps with Google Fusion Tables, covering basics, advanced techniques, and additional mapping resources.",
  "keywords": [
    "Google Fusion Tables",
    "geocoding",
    "choropleth map",
    "KML",
    "mapping tools"
  ]
}
```
