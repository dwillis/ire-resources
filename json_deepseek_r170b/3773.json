Alright, I need to help the user by creating a JSON object from their provided query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The user's instructions are quite detailed, so I should make sure to follow them closely.

First, the id is given as 3773, which is straightforward. Next, I need to extract the authors. The main author mentioned is Daniel Connolly from The Commercial Appeal. His email and phone number are provided, but since the user only asks for email in the JSON, I'll include that. There's also a mention of Sarah Cohen from Duke University who contributed, so she should be another author with her affiliation.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's set. The year isn't explicitly mentioned, so it will be "Not Listed". The title of the tipsheet is about finding holes in economic impact studies, which I can paraphrase into a concise string.

For the description, I need to summarize the content in 1-2 sentences. The tipsheet focuses on questioning the credibility and methodology of economic studies, especially regarding multipliers and subsidies. That's the core idea to capture.

Keywords are next. I'll identify relevant terms like economic impact studies, multipliers, subsidies, Electrolux, and jobs. These should be concise and exclude the conference and authors as per instructions.

I also need to ensure that all keys and values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Since no other languages are involved here, that's covered. I'll structure everything into a JSON object without any markdown formatting as the user requested.

Double-checking each section: id, authors with their details, conference, year, title, description, keywordsâ€”all seem to be correctly addressed. No information is made up; only provided data is used. The affiliation for Sarah Cohen is correctly noted as Duke University since her name appears with that in the text.

I think that's all. Time to put it together into a well-formatted JSON object.
