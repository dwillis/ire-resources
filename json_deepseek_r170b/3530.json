Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, looking at the id. The user specified that it should be 3530, so I'll set "id": 3530.

Next, authors. The document doesn't list any specific authors, so according to the instructions, I should leave the name as null. Since there's no email or affiliation mentioned either, both will be null. So, the authors array has one object with all fields null: {"name": null, "email": null, "affiliation": null}.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that goes into "conference": "IRE". The year isn't provided in the text, so "year": "Not Listed".

For the title, the tipsheet is about using Tableau Public with schools data, so I'll name it "Schools Data with Tableau Public".

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet provides steps for accessing, preparing, and visualizing school data using Tableau Public, so I'll write: "A guide on using Tableau Public to visualize and analyze schools data."

Keywords should be relevant and exclude the conference and authors. Important terms here are "Tableau Public", "schools data", "data visualization". That's three keywords, which is within the limit.

Putting it all together, ensuring each key is correctly formatted with quotes and proper structure.

```json
{
  "id": 3530,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Schools Data with Tableau Public",
  "description": "A guide on using Tableau Public to visualize and analyze schools data.",
  "keywords": [
    "Tableau Public",
    "schools data",
    "data visualization"
  ]
}
```
