Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id is given as T1280, so that's straightforward. 

Next, looking at authors, there's only one author mentioned: Robert Gebeloff with his email geobeloff@bergen.com. The affiliation isn't explicitly stated next to his name, but since his email is from bergen.com, which I know is The Bergen Record, I'll use that as the affiliation.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE New York Conference", so under the conference key, it will be "IRE". 

The year of the event is June 2, 2000, so that goes into the year field.

For the title, the main heading is "Home Health Care In Crisis", which is clear and concise.

The description needs to be a brief summary. The tipsheet discusses investigative resources used by The Bergen Record, including databases, internet links, and software. So I'll write it as: "A tipsheet detailing investigative resources used by The Bergen Record in their investigation of the home health care industry crisis."

Keywords should include no more than five relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, appropriate keywords are "home health care", "investigation", "databases", "resources", and "software".

Putting it all together, I ensure each key is properly quoted and the structure follows JSON syntax.
