Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) tipsheet. The user provided specific instructions on how to structure this JSON.

First, looking at the input, Jennifer LaFleur from ProPublica presented a session titled "Tracking the stimulus in your community." I'll note her as the author with her email and affiliation. Since it's an IRE conference, the conference key is set to "IRE." The year isn't provided, so I'll mark that as "Not Listed."

For the description, I need a concise summary. The session is about tracking federal stimulus spending in local communities, covering tools and methods for journalists. That should fit into 1-2 sentences.

Next, the keywords. They can't include conference or author names. Relevant terms here are "stimulus package," "federal spending," "journalism resources," "government contracts," and "data tracking."

Putting it all together, I structure each key as per the instructions: id, authors (as a list of objects), conference, year, title, description, keywords. All values must be in English with proper quotation marks.

I think that's everything. Now I can draft the JSON accordingly.

```json
{
  "id": 3320,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Jennifer LaFleur",
      "email": "jennifer.lafleur@propublica.org",
      "affiliation": "ProPublica"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Tracking the stimulus in your community",
  "description": "This tipsheet provides guidance on tracking federal stimulus spending at the local level, including tools and methods for investigating how funds are distributed and spent.",
  "keywords": [
    "stimulus package",
    "federal spending",
    "journalism resources",
    "government contracts",
    "data tracking"
  ]
}
```
