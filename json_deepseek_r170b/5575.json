Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given input about Mike Rezenedes' tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id is straightforwardâ€”it's provided as 5575. Next, the authors section. The input starts with "MIKE REZENDES LUCKY 13 TIP-SHEET...". Since Mike Rezenedes is mentioned at the top, I'll list him as an author. His name goes into the authors array with email and affiliation as null because there's no additional info provided about him.

Moving on to conference. The mention of "Investigative Reporters and Editors" clearly indicates that this is from an IRE conference, so the conference key will be "IRE".

The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the text, so I'll set it to "Not Listed". 

For the title, it's given as "MIKE REZENDES LUCKY 13 TIP-SHEET FOR GETTING SOURCES TO TALK", which I can clean up a bit for clarity.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet is about strategies journalists can use to get sources to open up, so I'll phrase it simply.

Keywords should capture the main topics without including the conference or authors. Terms like "journalism", "sources", "interviews", "investigative reporting", and "communication" seem appropriate.

I need to make sure all keys are in quotes and values are correctly formatted. Also, since no other authors are listed beyond Mike Rezenedes, the authors array only has one entry with his name and nulls for email and affiliation.

Putting it all together, I structure each key carefully, ensuring that everything aligns with the user's instructions. Double-checking to make sure there are no made-up names or incorrect affiliations, and keeping the description clear and within two sentences.
