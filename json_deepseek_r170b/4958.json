Okay, I'm trying to help create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has specified that I should focus only on creating this JSON without any additional text.

First, let me parse through the input material. The tipsheet is about "Packaging data stories for digital" with authors Ashlyn Still, Richard Watkins, Brittany Mayes, and Sarah Hutchins. 

I notice each author's section includes their name, title, affiliation, and sometimes contact info. For example, Brittany Mayes is from NPR Visuals with a Twitter handle. However, emails aren't provided, so I'll leave the email field as null.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, but there's no specific year mentioned in the text, so I'll set the year to "Not Listed". The title of the tipsheet is given at the top: "Packaging data stories for digital".

For the description, I need a concise summary. The content covers making scientific data consumable, unique visual approaches, and visualizing police shootings with multiple methods like databases and interactive visuals. So, a 1-2 sentence summary would mention these aspects.

Keywords should be no more than five terms related to the content but exclude the conference name and authors. Looking at the topics, "Data visualization", "Investigative journalism", "Digital storytelling", "Interactive graphics", and "Scientific data" fit well.

I'll structure each author as an object within a list under the "authors" key. Each author has "name", "email", and "affiliation". Since emails aren't provided, they remain null. Affiliations are taken from their mentioned news organizations like NPR Visuals or IRE.

Putting it all together, the JSON should have keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. Each part is filled based on the extracted information.
