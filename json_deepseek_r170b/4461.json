Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference, specifically NICAR. The user has given clear instructions on what each key should contain.

First, I'll start by identifying the id as 4461 since that's specified. Next, looking at the authors section, Ted Mellnik is the speaker. His email is provided as ted.mellnik@washpost.com and his affiliation is The Washington Post, which is mentioned in the contact information.

The conference is NICAR, and the year is 2015 because it's listed in the document. The title should be "Beyond Who: Using Voting and Election Data for Deeper Stories" since that's the main focus of the tipsheet.

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about using election data beyond just who won, so I'll write something like exploring advanced methods to analyze voting patterns and demographics.

Keywords are next. I should pick no more than five relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. "Voting data," "election analysis," "demographics," "precinct-level analysis," and "interactive journalism" fit well here.

I also need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. I'll structure each part carefully, making sure not to miss any details like email or affiliation.
