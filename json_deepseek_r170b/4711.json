Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The input provided includes details from Subramaniam Vincent's presentation on involving citizens in investigative journalism.

First, I'll start by identifying each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The id is given as 4711, so that's straightforward.

Next, the authors section. From the input, the main author mentioned is Subramaniam (Subbu) Vincent with an email and affiliation. His email is subbuvincent@stanford.edu, and he's affiliated with Stanford as a John S Knight Fellow. There are other contributors listed like Meera K, Shree D N, Citizen Matters team, and Savita Kini, but the user specified not to make up names if none are listed. Since these others don't have emails or affiliations provided, I'll only include Subbu Vincent in the authors list.

The conference is mentioned as part of the John S Knight Fellowship at Stanford, which I know is associated with IRE events, so the conference key should be "IRE".

Looking for the year, it's specified as 2016 since he was a fellow that year. So the year is 2016.

For the title, the presentation is titled "Beyond Crowdsourcing: Getting citizens involved in investigative journalism," which I can extract from the content.

The description needs to be a concise summary of the text. The tipsheet discusses involving citizens in investigations and using their knowledge and documents, so I'll phrase it as a 1-2 sentence summary.

Keywords should be no more than five terms related to the topic but excluding the conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords are crowdsourcing, citizen journalism, investigative journalism, public engagement, and collaboration.

Putting it all together, I structure each key with appropriate values, ensuring that emails and affiliations are correctly placed under authors.
