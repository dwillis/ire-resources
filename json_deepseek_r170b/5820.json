Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) tipsheet. The user provided some notes from Megan Luther's presentation titled "Keeping your career lit while raising humans." 

First, I'll parse the input. The main points include challenges faced by working parents like shifting responsibilities, mental load, parental leave, travel constraints, and workplace flexibility. There are tips on managing these issues, such as sharing tasks with partners, setting boundaries at work, and negotiating better work conditions.

The user wants a JSON response with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 5820. 

Looking for the author details, Megan Luther is mentioned. There's no email or affiliation provided, so I'll set those to null. 

The conference is likely NICAR since it was referenced in the notes (#NICAR19 meltdown). So conference should be "NICAR".

Year isn't explicitly stated, but #NICAR19 suggests 2019. However, since the user's example had year as "Not Listed," I'll stick with that.

For title, it's clearly "Keeping your career lit while raising humans."

The description needs to be a concise summary in simple language. I'll note it's about balancing a journalism career with parenting challenges and include some strategies mentioned.

Keywords should capture the essence without overlapping with conference or authors. I'll pick: work-life balance, mental load, parental leave, workplace flexibility, career management.

Putting it all together, ensuring each field is correctly formatted and enclosed in quotes.
