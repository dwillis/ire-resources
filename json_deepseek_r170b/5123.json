Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down what's needed step by step.

First, the structure of the JSON should include id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is provided as 5123, so that’s straightforward.

Looking at the content, I need to extract information about the author(s). The tipsheet is presented by Jim Oberman, who is affiliated with The Wall Street Journal. His email is listed as jim.oberman@wsj.com. There's also a mention of May Chow from LinkedIn Corporate Communications and Victoria Ipri, an independent consultant. So, I should include all three in the authors array.

Next, the conference is clearly stated as "IRE" since it’s from Investigative Reporters and Editors. The year is 2017, based on the date mentioned (June 22, 2017).

The title of the tipsheet is "What's Up With LinkedIn? Navigating the latest changes." I should make sure to include that exactly as it appears.

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about recent changes in LinkedIn features, particularly the removal of some search filters and workarounds for journalists using Premium. It also mentions potential future updates and provides research tips. So, summarizing this into one or two sentences would capture the essence without being too lengthy.

Now, the keywords should be relevant and not exceed five terms. From the content, "LinkedIn," "search filters," "Premium features," "journalist tools," and "workarounds" seem appropriate. They encapsulate the main topics without including the conference name or authors.

I also need to ensure that all keys are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Any missing information should be set to null, but in this case, we have enough details for each author except perhaps their emails, which are only provided for Jim Oberman.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, making sure each field is correctly filled based on the extracted data.
