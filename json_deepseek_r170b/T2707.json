Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given query and the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down what needs to be done step by step.

First, the user wants a response that's only a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as T2707. 

Next, looking at the input, I see two speakers listed:
- Jaimi Dowdell from St. Louis Post-Dispatch with email jdowdell@post-dispatch.com
- Aaron Kessler from The Daily Progress (Charlottesville, Va.) with email akessler@dailyprogress.com

So, each author should have name, email, and affiliation. Since their affiliations are provided as part of their introduction, I can fill those in accordingly.

The conference is the 2006 IRE Annual Conference in Dallas/Ft. Worth, so the conference key will be "IRE" and the year is clearly listed as 2006.

The title isn't explicitly stated, but the header says "The latest in social network analysis," which seems appropriate to use as the title.

For the description, it needs to be a concise summary of what social network analysis is and why it's useful for journalism. I'll make sure to keep it to 1-2 sentences in simple language.

Keywords should be no more than five terms excluding the conference or authors. From the content, relevant keywords could be "social network analysis," "investigative journalism," "data visualization," "relationships mapping," and "CAR (Computer-Assisted Reporting)."

Now, putting it all together into a JSON structure with proper syntax, ensuring all keys are in quotes and the values are correctly formatted.
