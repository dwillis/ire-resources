Alright, I need to create a JSON object from the provided tipsheet. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure it with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. 

First, the ID is straightforwardâ€”it's 3100 as specified.

Next, for the authors section, I see Kelly Kennedy listed with her email and affiliation from Army Times. So, I'll include her name, email, and set the affiliation to "Army Times" since that's the news organization mentioned.

The conference isn't explicitly stated in the text, so according to the instructions, it should be "Not Listed". The year is also not provided, so that remains as "Not Listed".

The title of the tipsheet is given clearly: "Digging in the Defense Department medical data mines".

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet focuses on investigating military medical data, so I'll phrase it to reflect that.

Keywords should be relevant and limited to five. The main topics here are medical data, military, Department of Defense, health reporting, and investigative journalism. These cover the essence without overlapping too much.

I must ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, no extra information is added beyond what's provided.
