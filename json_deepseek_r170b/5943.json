Alright, I'm trying to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through this step by step.

First, the id is provided as 5943, so that's straightforward. Now, looking at the authors section. The tipsheet mentions Barbara Gray and Erin Sood. Barbara is affiliated with the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at CUNY, and Erin works at the Dallas Morning News. Their emails aren't listed here, so I'll leave those as null.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE Houston 2019, which means the year is 2019. The title of the tipsheet seems to be "Research Geyser: Drilling Into the Latest in Investigative Research."

For the description, I need a concise summary. It should mention the topics covered like new Google operators, FOIA strategies, and verification tools. So something like: "This tipsheet covers new investigative research techniques, including advanced search operators, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) strategies, and digital verification tools for journalists."

Keywords are next. I need up to five relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. The main topics are Google operators, FOIA, open data, verification tools, and digital research. So those will be my keywords.

Putting it all together, I structure each part accordingly, ensuring that the JSON syntax is correct with proper quotation marks and commas. I double-check that there are no made-up names or incorrect affiliations.
