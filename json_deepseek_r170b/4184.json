Okay, so I've got this query where the user wants me to create a JSON object based on some tips from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. They were pretty specific about the structure: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, I need to parse their instructions carefully. The id is given as 4184. Authors are in a list with name, email, affiliation. But looking at the content, there's no author mentioned, so all those fields will be null. 

The conference is definitely IRE since it's from an IRE tipsheet. Year isn't specified, so I'll mark that as "Not Listed". The title should reflect the main theme; I think "Investigative Tips for Journalists" fits well.

For description, a concise summary: tips on investigating police and prosecutor statements. Keywords need to be relevant but not too manyâ€”maybe five terms like police accountability, journalist tips, public records, inmate interviews, civil rights lawyers.

I should ensure all values are in English and properly quoted. No markdown, just plain JSON. I'll structure it accordingly without adding any extra info beyond what's provided.
