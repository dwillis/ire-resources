Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Sharyl Attkisson at CBS News. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with certain keys.

First, the id is straightforward—it's 3270 as specified. Next, for authors, since the tipsheet only mentions Sharyl Attkisson and her affiliation with CBS News, I'll list her name and set email and affiliation accordingly. No other authors are mentioned, so that's simple.

The conference key should be "IRE" because it's from Investigative Reporters and Editors conferences. The year isn't given in the text, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

For the title, it's clearly "Parachuting In" Tip Sheet. The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about the importance of being on-site for journalism, following money trails, and finding contradictions, so I'll capture that in one or two sentences.

Keywords are next. I need up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Relevant terms here would include "investigative reporting", "journalism techniques", "on-scene reporting", "financial investigation", and "government spending".

Putting it all together, ensuring all keys are strings and properly formatted in JSON. Double-checking that no made-up information is added and all data aligns with the user's instructions.
