Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about resources for measuring college performance from an IRE conference.

First, the id is given as 3303, so that’s straightforward. The title isn’t explicitly stated, but looking at the headers, "Resources to get you started on measuring college performance" seems appropriate.

Next, under authors, Mary Beth Marklein is listed with her email and affiliation at USA TODAY. There are no other authors mentioned, so the list has only one entry.

The conference is IRE National Conference in Baltimore from 2009, so conference is "IRE" and year is 2009. 

For the description, it should be a concise summary. The tipsheet provides various resources for assessing college performance, including websites and reports. So I'll phrase that into a couple of sentences.

Keywords are to be no more than five, excluding conference and authors. Looking at the content, "college performance", "education data", "higher education", "student engagement", and "academic accountability" fit well.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly quoted. No made-up names or affiliations—only what's provided.
