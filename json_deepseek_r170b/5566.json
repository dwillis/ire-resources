Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Sarah Hutchins at an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me start by identifying each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, the ID is given as 5566. That's straightforward. Next, looking at the authors section, I see Sarah Hutchins listed with her email sarah@ire.org and affiliation with IRE. There are no other authors mentioned, so the authors list will only include her details.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE & NICAR, but according to the instructions, it should be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Since both IRE and NICAR are part of the same organization, I think just using "IRE" makes sense here. The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the text, so I'll set that to "Not Listed".

The title of the tipsheet is "Web searches & social media for journalists." For the description, I need a concise 1-2 sentence summary. It should highlight that the tipsheet provides strategies and tools for using web searches and social media in investigative journalism.

Now, for keywords. I'll extract relevant terms from the content: "web search", "social media", "investigative journalism", "Twitter search", and "Facebook search". These are all key topics covered without including the conference or author names.

Putting it all together, each part should be correctly formatted in JSON with appropriate quotation marks and structure. I'll make sure that all values are in English as required and that there are no made-up names.
