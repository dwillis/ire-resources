Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The user has provided specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, looking at the id: it should be 4266 as specified. 

Next, authors is a list where each author can have name, email, and affiliation. But in the given text, there are no specific authors mentioned, so I'll set each author's name to null. Since there's no email or affiliation provided either, those will also be null.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE", so that goes into the conference key.

For the year, the text doesn't mention a specific year, so it should be "Not Listed".

The title needs to be a concise representation of the content. The main focus here seems to be on tipsheets and resources from IRE conferences, so I'll go with "IRE Conference Tipsheet".

The description must be a 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. It should mention the availability of resources like presentations, handouts, story databases, etc., for investigative journalists.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the text, relevant keywords include tipsheets, investigative journalism, data journalism, conferences, and training.

Putting it all together, I structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring each key is properly quoted and values follow the guidelines.

```json
{
  "id": 4266,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "IRE Conference Tipsheet",
  "description": "A tipsheet from IRE conferences providing resources and tools for investigative journalists, including access to presentation materials, story databases, listservs, journals, and discounts on software.",
  "keywords": ["tipsheets", "investigative journalism", "data journalism", "conferences", "training"]
}
```
