Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's instructions. The input provided seems to be from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference, specifically from 2018, focusing on worker exploitation.

First, let me parse the input data. There are three presenters: Shoshana Walter from Reveal, Brett Murphy from USA Today, and Peggy Lowe from Harvest Public Media at KCUR. Their emails are also provided, so I'll include those in the authors' list with their respective affiliations.

The tipsheet covers methods for investigating worker exploitation, such as starting with victim narratives, using social media, engaging gatekeepers like lawyers, consulting experts, and approaching companies. It also mentions various documents and data sources like court records, labor complaints, and workers' compensation filings. Other tips include connecting findings to public knowledge and involving authorities post-publication.

For the JSON structure, I'll set the id as 5629. The authors array will have each presenter with their name, email, and affiliation. The conference is clearly "IRE" and the year is 2018. The title should be "Worker Exploitation," and a brief description summarizing the tipsheet's content.

Keywords need to be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. I'll choose "worker exploitation," "investigative reporting," "labor rights," "document analysis," and "data journalism."

I'll ensure all keys are in quotes, values are properly formatted, and the structure adheres strictly to JSON syntax.
