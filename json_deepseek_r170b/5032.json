Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions, so let me break it down step by step.

First, I'll start with the "id" field. It's supposed to be 5032, which is straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors section. The input doesn't list any specific names, emails, or affiliations. So each author object will have name as null, and both email and affiliation as null since there's no information provided.

The conference key needs to be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Since the tipsheet is titled for Michigan and mentions public records, it's safe to assume this is from an IRE event. Plus, the user example uses "IRE Conference" in the output, so I'll go with that.

For the year, the input doesn't specify when the conference took place, so I'll set it to "Not Listed".

The title should be the same as provided: "Public Records Available in Michigan". That's clear and descriptive.

Now, the description needs to be a concise 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet lists various public records available online in Michigan, covering things like prisoner locators, corporation lookups, and more. So I'll summarize that it provides access to these resources for investigative reporting.

Keywords are next. They should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking at the content, "public records", "Michigan", "investigative reporting", and "government transparency" seem relevant. That's four, so I can stop there or add one more if needed, but four is sufficient.

Putting it all together, each key needs to be in quotes, and string values also in quotes. Since the input is in English, everything stays in English.

I need to ensure that the JSON structure is correct with proper commas and brackets. Also, no trailing commas to avoid syntax errors.

So, assembling all these parts into a JSON object should meet the user's requirements accurately.

```json
{
  "id": 5032,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE Conference",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Public Records Available in Michigan",
  "description": "A tipsheet detailing free public records available online in Michigan, including prisoner locators, corporation lookups, and other investigative resources.",
  "keywords": [
    "public records",
    "Michigan",
    "investigative reporting",
    "government transparency"
  ]
}
```
