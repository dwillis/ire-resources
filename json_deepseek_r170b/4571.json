Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user provided a tipsheet from an IRE conference and wants it converted into a specific JSON format. First, I need to parse the given content carefully.

Looking at the input, Chris Vanderveen is the author from KUSA-TV in Denver. His presentation covers story structure, emphasizing moments, conflict, character, and consistency of theme. There's also mention of habits for effective storytelling.

Now, the user wants a JSON object with keys like id, authors, conference, etc. The id is 4571 as specified. For authors, I need to list each author with name, email, and affiliation. Since only Chris Vanderveen is mentioned, others are null. His affiliation is KUSA-TV.

The conference is "IRE" because it's from an Investigative Reporters and Editors event. The year isn't provided, so it defaults to "Not Listed". 

The title should capture the main topic, which seems to be about effective storytelling in TV news. The description needs a concise summary of the tipsheetâ€”maybe focusing on story structure elements like moments and emotional connections.

Keywords are next. I'll pick terms like "story structure", "moment-driven stories", "conflict", "character development", and "effective storytelling" to cover the key points without exceeding five terms.

I also need to ensure all values are in English, keys are enclosed in quotes, and no made-up data is included. Double-checking that I'm not adding any extra info beyond what's provided is crucial here.
