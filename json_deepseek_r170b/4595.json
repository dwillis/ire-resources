Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given input for an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me start by carefully reviewing the user's instructions.

First, I notice that the id is fixed at 4595, so I'll set that as "id": 4595. 

Next, looking at the authors section. The input lists two speakers: Ryan Gabrielson from ProPublica and Bernice Yeung from Reveal + CIR. Each has an email and affiliation provided. So, the authors array should have two objects with their details filled in. I'll make sure to include both name, email, and affiliation correctly.

The conference is specified as "AAJA + IRE WATCHDOG WORKSHOP 2015". Since AAJA isn't one of the options (IRE, NICAR, Not Listed), but it's co-hosted with IRE, I think "conference": "IRE" makes sense here. 

For the year, "2015" is clearly mentioned, so that goes into the "year" field.

The title of the tipsheet is "Cultivating Sources", which is repeated multiple times in the input. That's straightforward.

Now, the description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. The content seems to cover strategies for finding sources and conducting interviews on sensitive topics. So, I'll craft a concise summary highlighting these points.

Keywords should exclude conference and authors but include relevant terms like "sources", "reporting", "investigative journalism", etc. I'll pick the most relevant ones without exceeding five terms.

Putting it all together, I need to structure this into a JSON object with appropriate keys and ensure all values are correctly formatted in English, using quotation marks as required.
