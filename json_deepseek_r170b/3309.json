Alright, I'm trying to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id is specified as 3309, so that's straightforward. Next, for authors, there's only one author mentioned: Eric Nalder from Hearst Newspapers. His email is provided, ericnalder@hearst.com, and his affiliation is clearly Hearst Newspapers. So I'll structure that in the authors array.

The conference is definitely an IRE event since it's mentioned at the bottom as being prohibited without permission from Investigative Reporters and Editors, Inc. The year isn't explicitly stated, so I'll set it to "Not Listed".

The title of the tipsheet is "WRITING WITHOUT VEILS: How to get the story on the record". That seems clear enough.

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet offers strategies for journalists to use on-the-record sources effectively, so I'll phrase it as tips and techniques for that purpose.

Keywords should be relevant and up to five. From the content, important terms are "anonymous sources", "investigative journalism", "on-the-record", "journalism techniques", and "source relationships". These cover the main topics without overlapping with the conference or author names.

I need to make sure all keys are in quotes and values as well. Since the original text is in English, everything stays in English. I'll structure it accordingly without adding any made-up information.

Double-checking each part: id, authors with their details, correct conference, no year listed, proper title, concise description, and relevant keywords. Everything seems to fit.
