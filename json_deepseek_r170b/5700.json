Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conferences. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the user specified that the JSON should have keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is 5700 as given. 

Looking at the input, I see Ingrid Lobet's contact info and her Twitter handle. Her name is listed, so in the authors array, each author object should include name, email, and affiliation. Since there's no other authors mentioned, the array will have only one entry for Ingrid.

For her email, it's provided as yeiyelobet@gmail.com, and since she's associated with IRE, maybe that's the affiliation? Wait, looking back, IRE is the conference organizer, not necessarily her employer. Hmm, the input doesn't mention her affiliation beyond the conference. So perhaps her affiliation should be null.

The conference key is "IRE" because it's clearly stated as an IRE conference in Orlando 2018. The year is 2018 since that's specified.

The title of the tipsheet is about methane and natural gas reporting, so I can take the provided title: "Reporting on Methane/Natural Gas".

For the description, I need a concise summary. It should mention the resources listed like maps and where to find data, maybe the focus on tracking emissions.

Keywords are up to five terms. From the content, methane, natural gas, emissions, climate change, and EPA seem relevant since those are mentioned multiple times in the links and descriptions.

I also need to ensure all values are in English and properly quoted. Let me structure this step by step:

1. id: 5700
2. authors: array with one object containing Ingrid's details.
3. conference: "IRE"
4. year: 2018
5. title: As provided.
6. description: Summarize the content briefly.
7. keywords: Select five relevant terms.

I should double-check each part to make sure I didn't miss anything, like additional authors or affiliations that aren't present here. Everything seems covered now.
