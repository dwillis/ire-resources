Alright, I'm trying to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an IRE conference. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, the id needs to be 3550 as specified. The title is given as "Higher Ed: Following the money on campus," so that's straightforward.

Looking at the authors, there are three speakers: Holly Hacker from Dallas Morning News, Erica Perez from California Watch, and Ben Protess from New York Times. Each has their name, email, and affiliation. I'll list them in an array under "authors."

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE Conference â€“ Orlando," so that goes into the "conference" field with the year 2011.

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about tracking money in higher education through various agreements and records. So I'll write a brief sentence covering that.

Keywords should be relevant and limited to five. From the content, terms like "affinity agreements," "credit card contracts," "financial transparency," "public records," and "university finances" fit well.

Putting it all together, I structure each part according to the requirements, ensuring all keys are in quotes and values are correctly formatted.
