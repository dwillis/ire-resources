Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. The input provided seems to be from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet.

First, I'll note that the id should be 5057 as specified. Next, looking at the authors, Christine Zhang is mentioned with her Twitter handle @christinezhang and affiliation with NICAR 2017. There's no other author explicitly listed, so I'll set authors to an array containing only her details.

The conference is clearly NICAR, held in 2017. The title of the tipsheet isn't explicitly given, but based on the content, it's about the history and evolution of the NICAR conference.

For the description, I need a concise summary. It should mention that this tipsheet covers the growth and changes over two decades, including tools used and key moments.

Keywords are next. I'll extract relevant terms like "history", "evolution", "CAR techniques", "NICAR conference", but since the user mentioned excluding the conference name, I'll remove "NICAR". Instead, I can use "investigative journalism" as it's related.

I also need to ensure all keys and values are in English and properly quoted. I won't make up any names or emails if they're not present.
