Alright, so I need to create a JSON object from the given tipsheet. Let me start by carefully reading through the input provided.

First, I notice that the tipsheet is titled "Mining the Web for data and stories" from the Phoenix CAR 2010 conference. The authors listed are Ted Mellnik from The Charlotte Observer and Jaimi Dowdell from IRE/NICAR. 

The content of the tipsheet is divided into sections: searchable data, downloadable data, advanced search strategies, file types, URL manipulation, and GIS mapping services. It provides resources and techniques for journalists to find and extract data from government websites.

Now, moving on to structuring the JSON object. The id should be 3396 as specified. For authors, I need to create a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. Ted Mellnik is affiliated with The Charlotte Observer, so his affiliation is clear. Jaimi Dowdell's affiliation is listed as IRE/NICAR. Since emails aren't provided, they'll be null.

The conference is clearly stated as Phoenix CAR 2010, which I think falls under the IRE (Investigative Reporters & Editors) umbrella, so the conference key will be "IRE". The year is 2010 since it's mentioned in the title.

For the description, a concise summary would mention that the tipsheet provides strategies for finding and extracting government data online. It should highlight the main sections without getting too detailed.

Keywords need to be relevant but not include the conference or authors. I'll choose "data journalism," "government data," "web scraping," "GIS mapping," and " investigative reporting" as they cover the key topics.

I also have to ensure that all values are in English, which they are, and enclose everything in quotes as per JSON standards.
