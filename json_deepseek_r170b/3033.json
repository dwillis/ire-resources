Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query and the provided tipsheet. Let me go through this step by step.

First, the id should be 3033 as specified. The authors are Holly Hacker and Stan Ketterer. Their emails and affiliations are given, so I'll include those. 

Next, the conference isn't explicitly mentioned in the text. It just says "Based on a Power Point by David Donald" but doesn't specify if it's from IRE or NICAR. So I'll set conference to "Not Listed". The year is also not provided, so that will be "Not Listed" too.

The title should be the main topic, which seems to be about basic math skills for journalists. So I'll name it "Basic Math Skills".

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet covers percentage change, rates like per capita, statistics such as mean and median, weighted averages, sampling error, and using numbers effectively in news stories.

Now, keywords. I should pick relevant terms without including the conference or authors. From the content, "percentage change", "rates", "statistics", "sampling error", and "journalism" are appropriate. That's five keywords, so that works.

Putting it all together, I structure each part into the JSON format as specified.

```json
{
  "id": 3033,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Holly Hacker",
      "email": "hhacker@dallasnews.com",
      "affiliation": "Dallas Morning News"
    },
    {
      "name": "Stan Ketterer",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Basic Math Skills",
  "description": "A guide for journalists on effectively using and interpreting numbers in news stories, covering topics like percentage change, rates, statistics, sampling error, and clear presentation of numerical data.",
  "keywords": [
    "percentage change",
    "rates",
    "statistics",
    "sampling error",
    "journalism"
  ]
}
```
