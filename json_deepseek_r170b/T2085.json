Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to create this JSON object based on the user's query. They provided some specific instructions, so let me go through them step by step.

First, they want a tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors conferences, and it needs to be in JSON format with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as T2085.

Looking at the input provided, there's information about a session titled "20 Tips for using open records laws" from 2004, presented by Ken Ward Jr. at the IRE National Conference in Atlanta. So the conference key should be "IRE", and the year is clearly listed as 2004.

Next, authors. The user wants a list of elements with name, email, and affiliation. From the input, only Ken Ward Jr. is mentioned, along with his contact info: phone number (304) 348-1702 and email Kward@wvgazette.com. His affiliation isn't explicitly stated next to his name, but he's from The Charleston Gazette, so I should use that as his affiliation.

For the title, it's straightforward: "20 Tips for using open records laws". 

The description needs to be a concise summary of 1-2 sentences in simple language. The tips focus on encouraging journalists to regularly use FOIA requests as part of their reporting process, suggesting actions like filing requests early and often, understanding the law, and being proactive in accessing information.

Keywords are limited to five terms, excluding the conference name and authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords would be "FOIA", "open records", "journalism tips", "public access", and "investigative reporting".

Putting it all together, I need to structure this into a JSON object with each key properly filled out. Ensuring that all values are in English and correctly enclosed in quotes without any markdown formatting as per the user's instruction.

I think that covers everything. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything.
