Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference in Toronto. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the id is given as 4006, so that's straightforward.

Next, authors: The speaker is David Cay Johnston. His email and affiliation aren't listed here, but since he works for a news organization, I should use that. However, looking at the tipsheet, there's no mention of his current affiliation, so I'll leave it as null.

Conference: It's clearly stated as IRE Toronto Watchdog Workshop, so conference is "IRE".

Year: The event took place on 10 November 2013, so year is 2013.

Title: The main topic seems to be about business news opportunities in Canada, so I'll title it "Big Opportunities in Canadian Business News".

Description: This should be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers various financial aspects like banking, car markets, loans, and power assets. So, the description will mention investigative opportunities in these areas.

Keywords: I need up to five relevant terms. From the content, "business journalism", "finance", "trade", "banking", and "investigative reporting" fit well.

Putting it all together, each part is filled out correctly without any made-up information.
