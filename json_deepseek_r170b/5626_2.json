Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. Let me start by reading through their detailed instructions.

The input provided is a list of 25 deregulation points, each with an ID, title, description, and various other details like authors, conference info, etc. The user wants this converted into a specific JSON structure with keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, I notice that the user specified the id should be "5626_2". Since there are multiple entries, perhaps each will have its own id, but in this case, it's just one. 

Next, looking at the 'authors' key: it's a list where each element has name, email, and affiliation. The instruction says not to make up names; if none is listed, leave name as null. Also, if a news organization is mentioned, use that as the affiliation.

In the input, I don't see any author names listed, so authors will be an empty array with each entry having null for name, email, and affiliation.

The conference should be "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". The input starts with "IRE 2018 | Orlando", so conference is "IRE" and year is 2018.

The title seems to be "Deregulation Examples and Tips", as that's the main heading.

For the description, it needs to be a concise summary. Looking at the content, it includes various deregulation examples across industries like health, safety, finance, etc., along with tips on how to cover such topics. So I'll craft a 1-2 sentence summary capturing that essence.

Keywords are up to five terms, excluding conference and authors. Relevant keywords here would be "deregulation", "consumer impact", "industry changes", "regulatory rollbacks".

I should ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, the structure must be valid JSON, so I'll make sure syntax is correct.

Putting it all together, I'll format each key with appropriate values based on the input and instructions provided.

```json
{
  "id": "5626_2",
  "authors": [],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2018,
  "title": "Deregulation Examples and Tips",
  "description": "A list of examples and tips for covering deregulation, including industry groups, advocacy, individual consumers, lawyers, and how changes affect consumers.",
  "keywords": ["deregulation", "consumer impact", "industry changes", "regulatory rollbacks"]
}
```
