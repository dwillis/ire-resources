Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided text. Let me read through it carefully.

First, the id should be 3475. Got that down. Now, looking for authors. The article mentions "ProPublica" as the organization, but no specific author names are listed. So, the authors list will have an element with name null, email null, and affiliation "ProPublica".

Next, the conference. The text has a footer mentioning "© Copyright 2011 Pro Publica Inc." and some links, but I don't see any mention of a conference like IRE or NICAR. So, the conference key will be "Not Listed".

The year is clearly stated as 2011 in the copyright notice, so that's straightforward.

For the title, the main heading is "ProPublica’s Guide to Mechanical Turk". That should work as the title.

Now, the description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary. The text is about best practices for using Amazon Mechanical Turk, focusing on data quality and worker management. So, I'll condense that into a concise summary.

Keywords are next. The main topics covered are Mechanical Turk, crowdsourcing, data collection, worker management, and Amazon Mechanical Turk. I'll list those as keywords, making sure not to exceed five terms.

Putting it all together, ensuring each key is correctly filled with the right values, and everything is in English with proper quotation marks.
