Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with certain keys.

First, I'll start by identifying each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The id is given as 5299, so that's straightforward.

Next, the authors section should be a list of objects. Each author object has name, email, and affiliation. However, looking at the tipsheet provided, I don't see any specific authors mentioned. The content seems to be general tips without attributing to any particular person or organization. So each author entry will have null for name, email, and affiliation.

The conference is listed as "IRE" because the tipsheet clearly mentions Investigative Reporters and Editors conferences.

For the year, I don't see a specific date mentioned anywhere in the text, so it should be "Not Listed".

The title of the tipsheet is "An Excuse to Ask Questions: USING PUBLIC RECORDS TO CREATE ACCOUNTABILITY". I'll need to make sure this is captured accurately as a string.

The description needs to be a concise 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet focuses on using public records for investigative journalism, so I can write something like: "Tipsheet from IRE conference on using public records to create accountability through investigations."

Keywords are next. They should be relevant and limited to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking at the content, suitable keywords might include "public records", "accountability", "investigative journalism", "transparency", and "journalism tips". I'll make sure they're in a list format.

Putting it all together, each key is filled appropriately with the information extracted from the provided text. Since there are no specific authors listed, those fields remain null.
