Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided specific instructions on how to structure this JSON, with certain keys like id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, looking at the input, the main speaker is Denise Malan, who has an email denise@ire.org. Her affiliation isn't explicitly mentioned next to her name, but since she's presenting at IRE and her email is from ire.org, it's safe to assume her affiliation is IRE. 

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that key is straightforward. The year isn't provided in the text, so it should be "Not Listed". The title of the tipsheet seems to be "Social media search & verification" as it's highlighted at the top.

For the description, I need a concise summary. The document provides best practices for verifying social media accounts and content, including checking account details, finding the actual person, questioning articles, and using various tools for different platforms like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, photos, and videos. So the description could be something like: "Tipsheet providing best practices for verifying social media accounts and content."

Keywords should include relevant terms from the document without including the conference or authors. Looking through, keywords could be "social media verification", "account analysis", "photo verification", "video verification", and "fact-checking tools".

Putting it all together, I'll structure each key accordingly. The id is 5612 as specified. The authors list will have one object with name Denise Malan, email denise@ire.org, and affiliation IRE. All other keys are filled based on the above analysis.

```json
{
  "id": 5612,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Denise Malan",
      "email": "denise@ire.org",
      "affiliation": "IRE"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Social media search & verification",
  "description": "Tipsheet providing best practices for verifying social media accounts and content.",
  "keywords": [
    "social media verification",
    "account analysis",
    "photo verification",
    "video verification",
    "fact-checking tools"
  ]
}
```
