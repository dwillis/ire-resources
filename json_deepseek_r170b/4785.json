Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to create this JSON object based on the user's instructions. The input provided seems to be a step-by-step tutorial on using Tableau, but there are no authors or specific conference details mentioned. Let me break down what the user is asking for.

First, they want an id of 4785. That part is straightforward. Next, the authors section should be a list, but since there are no names provided in the text, each author entry should have name set to null. The same goes for email and affiliationâ€”they can be null as well because there's no information about them.

The conference key needs to be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Looking through the input, I don't see any mention of a conference, so it's safe to default to "Not Listed".

For the year, since the tutorial doesn't specify when it was published or presented, I'll set that to "Not Listed" as well.

The description should be a 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. The input is about creating Tableau visualizations and dashboards, so I can summarize that quickly.

Keywords are next. They should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Relevant keywords here might include "Tableau", "data visualization", "dashboard creation", etc.

I need to make sure all values are in English since the original text is in English, and all keys and string values are enclosed in quotes. I'll structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring that each part aligns with the user's instructions.

  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Tableau Tutorial for Data Visualization and Dashboard Creation",
  "description": "A step-by-step guide to creating visualizations and dashboards in Tableau, including filtering, sharing, and exporting options.",
  "keywords": [
    "Tableau",
    "data visualization",
    "dashboard creation",
    "filtering data",
    "sharing visualizations"
