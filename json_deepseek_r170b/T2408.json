Alright, I need to create a JSON object from the given tipsheet. Let's go through each part step by step.

First, the id is T2408 as specified. The authors section has Marina Walker Guevara with her email and affiliation to IRE. Since there are no other authors mentioned, that's straightforward.

Next, the conference is clearly labeled as IRE Conference in Denver 2005, so the conference key will be "IRE" and the year is 2005.

The title of the tipsheet is provided: "Digging up dirt: Investigating American companies’ environmental impacts in Latin America". 

For the description, it should be a concise summary. The main points are about holding U.S. companies liable for environmental damage abroad, with examples from Peru involving Newmont Co. and Doe Run Co., highlighting the need for investigative journalism beyond U.S. borders.

Keywords should include up to five relevant terms: "environmental impacts", "Latin America", "U.S. companies", "investigative reporting", and "accountability".

Putting it all together, I structure each key properly, ensuring no made-up names and correct enclosures.
