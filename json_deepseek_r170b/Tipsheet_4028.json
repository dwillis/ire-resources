Alright, so I need to create a JSON object from the given tipsheet about NodeXL for network analysis presented at NICAR 2014 in Baltimore. Let me break down what's needed.

First, the ID is Tipsheet_4028 as specified. Next, authors should be a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the input, Peter Aldhous is listed with his email and Twitter handle. Since there's no explicit affiliation mentioned beyond his contact info, I'll set affiliation to null.

The conference is NICAR since it's mentioned as "Hands-on at NICAR 2014". The year is clearly given as 2014. The title should be concise, so I'll go with "NodeXL for Network Analysis".

For the description, a 1-2 sentence summary: NodeXL is a tool for network analysis, and this tipsheet covers its features and applications in social media and political analysis.

Keywords need to be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. So, "network analysis", "social media", "NodeXL", "data visualization", and "political analysis" fit well.

Putting it all together in JSON format with proper enclosures and structure.
