Alright, so I need to create a JSON object from the given input based on specific instructions. Let me start by understanding what's being asked.

First, the user provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference about spatial data analysis. My task is to extract certain information and structure it into a JSON object with keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The id should be 4004 as specified. The authors section requires a list of objects, each containing name, email, and affiliation. However, the input doesn't mention any authors by name, so I'll set each author's name to null. Since there's no email or specific affiliation provided either, those will also be null.

Next, the conference is clearly identified as IRE because the document refers to "Investigative Reporters and Editors conferences." The year isn't explicitly stated in the text, so it should default to "Not Listed."

The title of the tipsheet is "INTRO TO SPATIAL DATA ANALYSIS" mentioned at the top. For the description, I need a concise summary. The content covers GIS basics, coordinate systems, shapefiles, and QGIS, so I'll craft a 1-2 sentence summary that encapsulates these elements.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking through the content, relevant keywords are "spatial data analysis," "GIS," "QGIS," "coordinate reference system," and "shapefile."

I must ensure all keys and values are in English and enclosed in quotes. I'll structure each part step by step, making sure not to miss any required fields or add extra information beyond what's provided.

Now, putting it all together, the JSON should accurately reflect the tipsheet's content with the specified structure.

```json
{
  "id": 4004,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "INTRO TO SPATIAL DATA ANALYSIS",
  "description": "This tipsheet introduces the basics of spatial data analysis using GIS, covering topics such as coordinate reference systems, shapefiles, and the use of QGIS.",
  "keywords": [
    "spatial data analysis",
    "GIS",
    "QGIS",
    "coordinate reference system",
    "shapefile"
  ]
}
```
