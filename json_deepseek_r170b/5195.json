Alright, let's break down this query. The user provided a detailed tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference about the National Registry of Exonerations. They want me to create a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, I notice that the id should be 5195 as per their instruction. Next, for the authors section, I need to extract names mentioned in the text. The tipsheet mentions Maurice Possley, Barbara Oâ€™Brien, and Samuel Gross. Their emails are also provided: NationalRegistryOfExonerations@umich.edu. Since this is a shared email, each author's email field can be null because it's not specific to them individually.

The affiliation for each author should be the organization they're associated with. Here, it's the National Registry of Exonerations, so I'll list that for each author.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, and the year isn't explicitly mentioned, so I'll set it to "Not Listed". 

For the title, I can use a concise version like "National Registry of Exonerations Tipsheet" to capture the essence.

The description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary. The main points are that it's a database tracking exonerations in the U.S., providing case details and analysis tools for journalists and researchers.

Keywords should include relevant terms without repeating the conference or authors. So, I'll go with "wrongful convictions", "exoneration data", "criminal justice", "investigative reporting", and "false confessions".

Putting it all together, I structure each part carefully to ensure compliance with the user's specifications.
