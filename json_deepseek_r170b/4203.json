Okay, so I'm trying to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me see what information I have here.

First, I need to understand the structure required. The keys needed are id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. Each of these has specific instructions on how they should be filled out.

The id is given as 4203, so that's straightforward. 

Next, authors: it's a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. In the input, I see "Christine Willmsen – Seattle Times" along with her contact info. So her name is Christine Willmsen, her email is cwillmsen@seattletimes.com, and affiliation is Seattle Times. Since there's only one author mentioned, that's all for the authors list.

The conference is IRE because it says "IRE 2014 – San Francisco". The year is 2014, so that goes into the year field.

For the title, looking at the tipsheet, it starts with "Ten Tips for Stories on Sexually Violent Predators", which seems like a suitable title. 

The description needs to be a concise summary of 1-2 sentences in simple language. The tipsheet provides ten tips for reporting on sexually violent predators, including courtroom observations and financial tracking. So the description could capture that essence.

Keywords should be no more than five terms excluding conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords might include "Sexually Violent Predators", "investigative journalism", "courtroom reporting", "financial investigation", "public records". I'll pick the top five that best represent the tipsheet's focus.

Putting it all together, making sure to use proper JSON syntax with everything in English and enclosed in quotes. Also, ensuring that if any information isn't present, like if there were multiple authors but only one is listed, we just include what's available without making anything up.
