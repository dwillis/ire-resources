Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has provided detailed information about a presentation by Ziva Branstetter regarding funds after the Oklahoma City bombing.

First, I'll start with the id, which is 3921 as specified. Next, the authors section should include Ziva Branstetter's details. Her email and affiliation are given, so that's straightforward.

The conference is clearly IRE since it's mentioned in the text. The year isn't provided, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed". For the title, the main focus was on the mishandling of bombing relief funds, so that becomes the title.

In the description, I need a concise summary. It should mention the investigation into the Oklahoma City Community Foundation and how funds weren't distributed properly, highlighting survivors' struggles. That's about two sentences.

Now, keywords are important for searchability. Key terms here would be "Oklahoma City bombing", "relief funds", "nonprofit management", "survivor support", and "financial accountability". I need to ensure these are relevant without overlapping too much with each other.

I should make sure all keys are in English, enclosed in quotes, and that the JSON structure is correct. No markdown or extra formatting should be included. Let me double-check each part to ensure compliance with the user's instructions.
