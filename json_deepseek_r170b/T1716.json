Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from the 2002 IRE Conference in San Francisco. Let's break down each required key step by step.

First, the id is given as T1716, so that's straightforward.

Next, for authors, there are three individuals mentioned: Jim Steele, Joe Stephens, and Mike McGraw. Each has an email and affiliation. The affiliations are Time Magazine, The Washington Post, and The Kansas City Star respectively. I'll structure each author with name, email, and affiliation fields.

The conference is clearly stated as the 2002 IRE Conference, so the conference key will be "IRE" and the year is 2002.

The title of the tipsheet is "Unsung Investigative Documents."

For the description, it should be a concise summary. The document talks about using underutilized sources and documents in investigative journalism, providing strategies for finding and utilizing these resources effectively.

Keywords need to be up to five terms that capture the essence without including the conference or authors. Looking at the content, appropriate keywords might be "investigative journalism," "document research," "FOIA," "public records," and "journalist tools."

I'll make sure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Each key is also in quotes as per JSON standards.

Now, putting it all together, I ensure that each part aligns with the structure provided in the query.
