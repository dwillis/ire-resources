Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided input. The user has specified several keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the id is given as 5785, so that's straightforward. Next, the authors are supposed to be a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the input, I see mentions like "Mike" in some training videos, but there's no full name provided. Since the user instructed not to make up names, I should leave the name as null if it's not explicitly listed.

The conference needs to be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". The input starts with "NICAR", so thatâ€™s clear. The year is a bit tricky because the text doesn't specify when the event took place. Since it's not clearly identified, I'll set it as "Not Listed".

For the title, the input seems to be about examples and training materials for Google Earth Pro and related tools. So, a suitable title could be something like "Google Earth Pro Examples and Training Materials".

The description should be a concise summary of one or two sentences. The text is primarily showcasing how various news organizations have used Google Earth Pro in their reporting through different projects and training initiatives.

Keywords are limited to five terms, excluding the conference and authors. The main topics here are Google Earth Pro, journalism tools, training materials, NICAR examples, and media applications. These seem appropriate.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each key accordingly, ensuring that authors with missing info have nulls where necessary and that affiliations reflect any mentioned news organizations like Gannett or the Louisville Courier-Journal.

    },

      "affiliation": "Louisville Courier-Journal"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Google Earth Pro Examples and Training Materials",
  "description": "Examples of how news organizations have used Google Earth Pro to create interactive stories, videos, and tours. Includes training materials and demonstrations.",

    "Media applications"
  ]
}
