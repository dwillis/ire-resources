Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. Let me start by understanding what they're asking for. They provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference about keeping government accountable through procurement reporting.

First, I'll identify the necessary keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as T2630. For authors, there's only Dan Keating mentioned, affiliated with The Washington Post. So I'll list him in the authors array.

The conference is NICAR, which stands for National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting, so that goes under conference. The year is 2006 as per the text.

The title should be something like "Keeping Government Accountable: Following the Money." For the description, I need a concise summary of the tipsheet in simple language. It talks about using procurement data and contracts to investigate government spending, so I'll mention that.

Keywords are limited to five terms. I'll choose relevant ones like procurement, contracts, investigative reporting, government spending, accountability.

I should ensure all values are in English and enclosed in quotes. No made-up names, emails, or affiliations. Since the year is clear, it's 2006.

Putting it all together, I structure each part carefully to meet the user's specifications.
