Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided query. Let me go through each requirement step by step.

First, the user wants an object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The ID is given as T1867. 

Looking at the text, Steve Weinberg is the author. He's affiliated with the University of Missouri Journalism School and the Center for Public Integrity. There are co-authors mentioned: Brooke Williams and Neil Gordon from the same center. So, I'll list all three under authors, each with their name, email as null, and affiliation.

The conference is clearly stated as Investigative Reporters & Editors (IRE), so that's straightforward. The year is 2003 since the event was in June of that year. 

For the title, it's "COVERING A LOCAL PROSECUTOR’S OFFICE EFFECTIVELY DAY TO DAY." I'll make sure to capitalize it correctly.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The main points are that journalists often cover prosecutors superficially and that this tipsheet provides strategies for deeper coverage by tracking cases from arrest to outcome, examining plea agreements, and understanding the prosecutor's role. So, I'll condense that into two sentences.

Keywords should be up to five relevant terms. From the text, "prosecutors," "criminal justice system," "journalism techniques," "investigative reporting," and "court coverage" seem appropriate.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly quoted. Also, avoid making up any information and leave nulls where necessary.
