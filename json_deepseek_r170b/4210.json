Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has specified that the response should only include this JSON object.

First, I'll parse the input to extract all necessary information. The title of the tipsheet is "Investigating Religion: Public records, not-so-public records and just showing up." 

Next, I look for the author details. Eric Gorski is listed as the investigative and projects reporter at The Denver Post, with his email provided. So, I'll structure the authors array with one object containing his name, email, and affiliation.

The conference mentioned is the Investigative Reporters and Editors Conference in San Francisco, which took place in 2014. Therefore, the conference key will be "IRE" and the year is clearly listed as 2014.

For the description, I need a concise summary of the tipsheet. It discusses how to investigate religious organizations using public records, alternative sources when public records are insufficient, and the importance of on-site reporting. I'll condense this into one or two sentences in simple language.

Keywords should be relevant and exclude the conference and authors. From the content, appropriate keywords include "public records," "religious organizations," "investigative journalism," "financial documents," and " Freedom of Information Act" (FOIA).

I need to ensure that all keys are correctly named and values are properly enclosed in quotes. The id is given as 4210, so I'll set that accordingly.

Finally, I'll structure the JSON object with all these elements, making sure it's valid and follows the user's specifications precisely.

  ],
  "conference": "IRE",

  "title": "Investigating Religion: Public records, not-so-public records and just showing up",

  "keywords": [
