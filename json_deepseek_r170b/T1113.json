Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to create this JSON object based on the user's instructions. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify each part of the input text provided. The input is a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference in Copenhagen on May 3, 2003, titled "International data – How and where to find them" by Sofia Basso. It includes various web tools and databases with URLs.

The user wants me to create a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. Let's go through each one:

1. **id**: The user specified it should be "T1113". So that's straightforward.
2. **authors**: It should be a list of objects, each with name, email, and affiliation. In the input, Sofia Basso is listed as the author, but there's no email or affiliation provided. Since she's associated with the conference, which is IRE, maybe her affiliation could be inferred as IRE, but the instructions say to use the news organization if mentioned. There isn't one here, so affiliation stays null. So each author object will have name set to "Sofia Basso", email and affiliation as null.
3. **conference**: The input says it's from an IRE conference, so this should be "IRE".
4. **year**: The date is clearly May 3, 2003, so year is 2003.
5. **title**: The title given is "International data – How and where to find them". Need to make sure to include the dash as in the input.
6. **description**: It should be a concise summary of 1-2 sentences. The tipsheet provides tools and databases for finding international data, so something like: "A tipsheet providing tools and resources for locating international data, including web archives, statistical databases, and data conversion methods."
7. **keywords**: Up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords might be "international data", "web tools", "statistical databases", "data conversion". That's four; maybe add one more like "research resources" or "investigative journalism". But I think four is enough.

Now, putting it all together in JSON structure:

- id: "T1113"
- authors: Array with one object: {name: "Sofia Basso", email: null, affiliation: null}
- conference: "IRE"
- year: 2003
- title: As given.
- description: The summary I crafted.
- keywords: ["international data", "web tools", "statistical databases", "data conversion"]

I should ensure all keys and values are in quotes. Also, make sure no markdown is included as per the user's note.

Let me double-check each part to ensure accuracy. Authors only have Sofia Basso with no contact info, conference is IRE, year correct, title accurate, description concise, keywords relevant.

    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2003,
  "title": "International data – How and where to find them",
  "description": "A tipsheet providing tools and resources for locating international data, including web archives, statistical databases, and data conversion methods.",
  "keywords": [

    "web tools",
    "statistical databases",
    "data conversion"
  ]
}
```
