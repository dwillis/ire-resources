Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided document. Let me read through the document first to understand what it's about.

The document is a memorandum from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) discussing the use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) by the media for newsgathering. It addresses three main issues: whether media can use UAS, if they can use data from third-party UAS operations, and authorization requirements for selling images collected by UAS.

Now, I need to extract specific information for the JSON keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The id is given as 4464. 

For authors, the memorandum lists several people:
- James H. Williams, Manager, Unmanned Aircraft Integration Office
- Mark W. Bury, Assistant Chief Counsel
- Dean E. Griffith, Attorney

I'll create an array of objects for each author with name, email, and affiliation. Since emails aren't provided, they'll be null. Affiliations are based on their positions, so "Federal Aviation Administration" for all.

Conference: The document is from the FAA, not directly linked to IRE or NICAR conferences, so it should be "Not Listed".

Year: The date on the memo is May 5, 2015, so year is 2015.

Title: The subject line is "Media Use of UAS", which will serve as the title.

Description needs a concise summary. It's about FAA guidelines for media using drones for newsgathering, including authorization and commercial use rules.

Keywords should be up to five relevant terms: "UAS", "media", "FAA", "drones", "newsgathering".

Putting it all together now.
