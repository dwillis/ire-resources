Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has provided specific instructions on how each key should be filled out.

First, the id is straightforward: T2487.

Next, authors are listed as Ismael Estrada, who's an investigative producer at WMAQ NBC 5 Chicago. Since only his name and affiliation are given, I'll set his email to null. There might be other authors mentioned, but looking through the text, it seems he's the only one listed.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE in Denver 2005, so the conference key will be "IRE" and the year is 2005.

For the title, the tipsheet is titled "Storytelling: How to Structure an Investigation."

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers organizing thoughts, handling conflicts like time constraints or too much information, involving the team through communication, effective interviewing techniques, writing strategies that emphasize key points, and structuring the story with elements like foreshadowing and pacing.

Now, for keywords. I should pick up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Relevant terms from the content are "storytelling," "investigation structure," "conflicts in reporting," "interview techniques," and "writing strategies." These capture the main points without being too broad or narrow.

I need to ensure all keys and values are in English and enclosed in quotes. Also, the JSON should be properly formatted without any markdown.
