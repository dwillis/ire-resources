Okay, so I need to figure out how to create this JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me start by reading through the user's query and understanding their requirements.

First, they want a response that's only a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is fixed as 4525. The authors should be a list of objects, each with name, email, and affiliation. They emphasized not to make up names; if none are listed, leave the name null. Email and affiliation can be null too, but if there's a news organization mentioned, use that for affiliation.

Looking at the input, I see the author is Manny Garcia from Naples Daily News, with a Twitter handle @MANNY_GARCIA1. Since email isn't provided, it'll be null. So his entry in authors will have name as "Manny Garcia", email null, and affiliation "Naples Daily News".

Next, the conference is IRE because the tipsheet is from an IRE event. The year isn't specified, so that's "Not Listed". The title of the session is "The art of developing Sources: owning your beat".

For the description, it needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers developing sources, being visible, accuracy, understanding the beat, and treating sources with dignity. So I'll condense that into one or two sentences.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking through the content, relevant keywords might include "source development", "journalism best practices", "investigative reporting", "media credibility", and "beat reporting".

Putting it all together, each part of the JSON is filled in accordingly. I need to ensure that all keys are enclosed in quotes and that the structure is correct without any markdown.

I should double-check if there are multiple authors, but here it's only Manny Garcia. Also, make sure that the URLs provided aren't included as they're not needed for the JSON. The main points are correctly captured in the summary to form a clear description.

    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "The art of developing Sources: owning your beat",
  "description": "Tipsheet covers strategies for building credibility, understanding the beat, and maintaining trust with sources.",
  "keywords": [

    "journalism best practices",
    "investigative reporting"
  ]
}
```
