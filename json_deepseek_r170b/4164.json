Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's instructions. The input provided seems to be from Margot Williams' tipsheet at an IRE conference in 2014. 

First, identify the id which is given as 4164.

Next, authors: there's only one author mentioned, Margot Williams with her email and affiliation ICIJ. So the authors list will have one object with name, email, and affiliation filled accordingly.

Conference is clearly stated as IRE since it's from an Investigative Reporters and Editors conference.

Year is 2014 as given in the input.

Title: Looking at the content, it's about effective Google searching and research links. So a suitable title would be "Effective Google Searching and Research Links".

Description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet provides various online resources for investigative journalists, so I'll write that it's a collection of web tools and databases for them.

Keywords: Extract relevant terms like "Google searching", "investigative journalism", "research tools", "public records", and "ICIJ". Make sure not to exceed five.

Now, structure all these into the JSON format with proper syntax and ensure all keys are in quotes.
