Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id is given as 5962. That's straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors section. There are two people mentioned: Linda Byron and Tony Kovaleski. I'll need to extract their details. For Linda Byron, her name is clearly stated, but there's no email provided in the text. Her affiliation is listed as a Professional Story Teller & Investigative Coach. So her email and some other fields might be null.

Tony Kovaleski's section includes his name, email (Tony@thedenverchannel.com), and his position at Denver7 and Scripps Corp. So I can fill in all those details for him.

The conference is IRE since the tipsheet is from an IRE event in Seattle 2019, so that's clear. The year is 2019 as well.

The title of the tipsheet is "THE ART OF THE INVESTIGATIVE INTERVIEW".

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet covers preparation, execution, and techniques for conducting investigative interviews, including case studies and tips from experts. So I'll phrase that into a couple of sentences.

Keywords should be up to five terms. Looking at the content, relevant keywords are "investigative interviewing", "journalism techniques", "interview preparation", "case studies", and "media training".

Putting it all together, making sure each field is correctly formatted as per JSON standards.
