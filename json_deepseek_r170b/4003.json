Alright, so I'm trying to create this JSON object based on the provided text about scraping tools for journalism. Let me break down what needs to be done step by step.

First, I need to parse the input which is a tutorial or guide on web scraping using Chrome's scraper. The keys required in the JSON are id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

Starting with the id: it should be 4003 as specified. That’s straightforward.

Next, authors. I need a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. The text mentions "Paul Bradshaw" in the context of his book, so that's one author. However, there are no other authors mentioned in the provided snippet. So, Paul is the only author here. His email isn't given, so it should be null. For affiliation, since he's associated with a book on scraping for journalists, I can assume his affiliation is related to that, perhaps "Scraping for Journalists" or just leave it as null if not explicitly mentioned.

Moving on to conference. The text mentions IRE and NICAR as possible conferences. In the provided snippet, it talks about Paul Bradshaw's book in relation to a tutorial, but doesn't specify if this was presented at IRE or NICAR. Since the original text isn’t clear, I should mark conference as "Not Listed".

For the year, again, looking through the text, there's no specific year mentioned for when the event took place. So, year will also be "Not Listed".

The title of the work is about scraping tools for journalism, so maybe something like "Scraping Tools for Journalists" or similar.

Description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. The text discusses using Chrome's scraper and other tools, so I can write that it provides an overview of web scraping tools and techniques useful for journalists.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. From the text, relevant keywords could include "web scraping", "journalism tools", "data extraction", "Chrome scraper".

Putting it all together, each part needs to be correctly formatted in JSON with proper quotation marks and structure. I also need to ensure that any missing information is set to null where appropriate.

I think that covers everything required for the JSON object.
