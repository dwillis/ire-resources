Okay, so I have this query where the user wants me to create a JSON object based on some provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. They’ve given specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, the id is fixed at 3982, that's straightforward. Next, authors need to be a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. In the text, there’s Jill Riepenhoff listed with her contact info. So I can fill in her details: name as "Jill Riepenhoff", email from jriepenhoff@dispatch.com, and affiliation as The Columbus Dispatch since that's her employer.

Conference is specified as either IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed. Since the tipsheet mentions it's from an IRE conference, I'll set that. Year isn’t given, so it goes to "Not Listed".

The title should be a brief headline capturing the content. The tipsheet seems focused on using consumer complaint data for investigative journalism, so I can go with "Using Consumer Complaint Data for Investigative Stories".

Description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet provides sources for complaints and how they were used in various investigations, so something like highlighting where to find data and how it's been applied makes sense.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking at the content, "consumer complaints", "investigative journalism", "data analysis" fit well. Then "credit reports" and "debt collection" since those were specific areas of investigation mentioned.

I need to make sure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. No markdown, just plain JSON. Also, avoid any made-up data—so if something's not there, it stays as null or "Not Listed".

Double-checking everything: id is 3982, authors have Jill with her correct details, conference is IRE, year is Not Listed, title and description are clear, keywords are relevant and within limit. Looks good.
