Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given query. The user provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference titled "Collaboration: Tips & Techniques" or “What I wish someone had told me a year ago.” It's about a partnership between inewsource and KPBS.

First, I should parse all the details given. They discussed their collaboration on investigative journalism projects, including producing content for TV, radio, and web. Tools they used include specific audio recorders, cameras, and software. Workflow tips were categorized into before, during, and after the story.

I need to structure this into a JSON object with keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is 3973. For authors, since names aren't provided, they'll be null. Affiliation should be inewsource and KPBS. Conference is IRE. Year isn't listed, so "Not Listed." Title remains as given. Description needs a concise summary. Keywords would include collaboration, investigative journalism, multimedia production, data-driven storytelling, partnership.

I must ensure all values are in English, keys are enclosed in quotes, and no markdown is used. Also, the JSON should be properly formatted without any syntax errors.
