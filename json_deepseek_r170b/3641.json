Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has specified that the response should only include this JSON object without any additional text.

First, let me understand the structure required. The JSON must have keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. 

- **id**: Given as 3641.
- **authors**: A list of objects each with name, email, and affiliation. Emails might be null if not provided. Affiliations should use the news organization mentioned, so I'll extract those from the headers.
- **conference**: Since the authors are from IRE, it's safe to assume this is an IRE conference.
- **year**: The text doesn't specify a year, so it will be "Not Listed".
- **title**: Extracted as "Digging deep with data journalism".
- **description**: A 1-2 sentence summary. Looking at the content, the tipsheet emphasizes using data for uncovering information and testing policies through data journalism tools.
- **keywords**: Up to five terms excluding conference and authors. The content talks about data journalism, CAR (Computer-Assisted Reporting), Excel, SQL, and Tableau.

Now, I'll process each section:

1. **Authors**: Jaimi Dowdell from IRE, Rob O’Dell from Arizona Daily Star, Angélica Peralta Ramos from LA NACION. No emails provided, so those will be null.

2. **Description**: Summarize the main points—using data to uncover info, test policies, enterprise reporting, and interactive graphics.

3. **Keywords**: Data journalism, CAR, Excel, SQL, Tableau Public.

Putting it all together into a JSON structure:

- id: 3641
- authors: list of three objects with name, email (null), affiliation.
- conference: "IRE"
- year: "Not Listed"
- title: "Digging deep with data journalism"
- description: A concise summary focusing on the use of data in journalism for various purposes.
- keywords: The selected terms.

I need to ensure all keys and values are enclosed in quotes, and the JSON is valid. No markdown should be present as per the user's request after their initial instruction. Also, the response should only contain the JSON object without any surrounding text or explanations.

Double-checking each part for accuracy, especially ensuring that affiliations are correctly assigned based on the provided text.
