Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. Let me read through their instructions carefully.

The main goal is to structure the response as a tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conferences. The id must be 5349. 

First, looking at the authors section: they provided a list of names with some having affiliations like MPR News. I'll need to create an array where each author has name, email, and affiliation. Since emails aren't listed, those will remain null. For example, Jon Collins is affiliated with MPR News.

Next, the conference field should be "IRE" as per the context given. The year isn't specified in the input, so it'll default to "Not Listed".

The title should reflect the contentâ€”something like "Tips for Journalists Creating a News Podcast". 

For the description, I need a concise summary of the tips provided. Maybe something about story selection, production advice, and ethical considerations.

Keywords are up to five terms related to podcasting and journalism. I'll choose relevant ones like "podcasting", "journalism", etc., avoiding the conference name and authors' names.

I must ensure all values are in English unless specified otherwise, which they aren't here. Also, every key and value should be enclosed in quotes as per JSON standards.

Let me structure this step by step to make sure I don't miss anything.
