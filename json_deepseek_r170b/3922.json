Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from the IRE San Antonio conference in June 2013. The user has given specific instructions about the structure and content of the JSON.

First, I'll start by identifying each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is given as 3922, so that's straightforward.

Next, for the authors section, I need to list all contributors with their name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the text, Kendall Taggart and Kris Hundley are mentioned. Their emails and affiliations are provided, so I'll include those details. The third author is Ron Campbell from the Orange County Register, but his email isn't listed, so I'll set it to null.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE San Antonio, so the conference key will be "IRE". The year is June 2013, which means the year value should be 2013.

For the title, the main topic of the tipsheet is about investigating nonprofits using documents and tools, particularly focusing on the 990 form. So a suitable title would be "Documents and Tools for Investigating Nonprofits".

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet discusses how to use Form 990, audits, state filings, and other resources to investigate nonprofits, so I'll condense that into one or two sentences.

Keywords should include relevant terms like "nonprofits", "Form 990", "audits", "state filings", and "IRS". These are the main topics covered in the tipsheet.

I also need to ensure that all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. I'll structure each part carefully, making sure not to miss any details from the original text.
