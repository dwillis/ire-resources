Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me break down the requirements step by step.

First, the structure should have specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 5283. 

Looking at the input provided, it's a list of various tools and resources presented by Doug Haddix at an IRE conference. So the conference key should be "IRE". 

The user didn't specify the year in their example, so I'll set year to "Not Listed". The title is clearly "COOL APPS & TOOLS" from the input.

Now for authors: there's only one author mentioned, Doug Haddix. His email and affiliation aren't provided, so those will be null. 

The description needs to be a concise summary. Since it's about tools for journalists, I'll write something like "A collection of apps and tools for investigative journalism."

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference name. From the input, key tools mentioned are Twitter, Facebook, data visualization, mapping tools, reverse image search, and web scraping. But I need to pick the most relevant ones without overlapping with the conference name.

I think "Twitter", "Facebook", "data analysis", "mapping tools", and "web scraping" are appropriate as they cover the main topics without duplication.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring proper syntax and null where information isn't available.

    {
      "name": "Doug Haddix",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Investigative Reporters and Editors"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "COOL APPS & TOOLS",
  "description": "A collection of apps and tools for investigative journalism, including social media analysis, data visualization, mapping, and web scraping tools.",
  "keywords": [

    "Facebook",
    "data analysis",
    "mapping tools",
    "web scraping"
