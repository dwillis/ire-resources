Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The id should be 4011.

First, looking at the authors section. Doug Haddix is mentioned with his email and Twitter handle, but no affiliation is provided. So I'll list him as the author with name "Doug Haddix", email "doug.haddix@gmail.com", and affiliation null since it's not specified.

The conference is clearly labeled as IRE, so that goes under conference. The year isn't mentioned anywhere in the text, so I'll set year to "Not Listed".

For the title, the main topic seems to be using social media for investigations, so the title should reflect that, maybe "Using Social Media for Investigations".

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers tools and techniques like Facebook Open Graph, Geofeedia, LinkedIn, and others. So I'll write it as a 1-2 sentence overview of how these tools help journalists find sources and track events.

Keywords should include the main social media platforms and tools mentioned: Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Geofeedia, and Social search.

Putting it all together, ensuring each field is correctly formatted with quotes and proper syntax.
