Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors conference. The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, looking at the "id" field. It needs to be T2629 as per the input. Got that down.

Next are the authors. The tipsheet lists Ken Ward Jr., his email, and affiliation with The Charleston Gazette. So I'll structure this into an array of objects with name, email, and affiliation.

The conference is clearly stated as NICAR Annual Conference in Newark, N.J., so "conference" key will be "NICAR". The year is 2006, straightforward from the date provided.

For the title, it's given as "Using CAR to report on Mine Safety". That fits perfectly.

The description needs to be a concise summary. I'll mention how the tipsheet guides journalists in using CAR to investigate mine safety, covering basics like types of mines and using MSHA resources for data analysis.

Keywords should be up to five terms related to the topic but excluding conference names or authors. So I'll pick "CAR", "Mine Safety", "MSHA", "Data Journalism", and "Investigative Reporting".

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly quoted, with no made-up information. Any missing data like email or affiliation should be null if not present.

Finally, putting it all together into a JSON structure without any markdown formatting as per the user's request.
