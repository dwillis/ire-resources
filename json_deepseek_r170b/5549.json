Alright, so I'm trying to create a JSON object based on the user's instructions. Let me start by understanding what they need. The input provided seems to be from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet about digital storytelling.

First, I'll parse through the text to extract relevant information. The title is "DIGITAL STORYTELLING" as given at the top. There are several examples mentioned from different news outlets like The Washington Post, NY Times, USA Today, etc., but these seem to be part of the content rather than authors.

Looking for the authors section, I see a mention of Megan Christie from ABC News Investigative Unit with her email provided. So she's one author. There's also Marco Garcia mentioned as a Senior Adviser on News Design and Adjunct Professor at Columbia Journalism School. His affiliation is clear, but no email is given, so that field will be null.

The conference isn't explicitly stated in the text, but since it's about IRE conferences, I'll set "conference" to "IRE". The year isn't mentioned anywhere, so it should be "Not Listed".

For the description, I need a concise summary. It's about using writing, editing, and design together to create engaging digital stories. So something like: "This tipsheet explores how journalists can combine writing, editing, and design (WED) to create immersive digital storytelling experiences."

Keywords should be relevant terms from the content. They include "digital storytelling", "writing, editing, and design (WED)", "immersive journalism", "multiplatform design", and "investigative reporting".

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with id 5549, list of authors with their details, conference as IRE, year not listed, the description, and keywords.

```json

  "id": 5549,

    {
      "name": "Megan Christie",
      "email": "megan.christie@abc.com",
      "affiliation": "ABC News Investigative Unit"
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "DIGITAL STORYTELLING",
  "description": "This tipsheet explores how journalists can combine writing, editing, and design (WED) to create immersive digital storytelling experiences. It includes examples from major news outlets and strategies for implementing these concepts in reporting.",
  "keywords": [
    "digital storytelling",
    "writing, editing, and design (WED)",
    "immersive journalism",
    "multiplatform design",
    "investigative reporting"
  ]
}
```
