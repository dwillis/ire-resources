Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through this step by step.

First, looking at the input, it's titled "Blogs, wikis and RSS in the newsroom" presented by Matthew Waite from the St. Petersburg Times at the NICAR National Conference in Newark, NJ, March 9-12, 2006. The content discusses various blogging and wiki software options for use within a newsroom.

I need to structure this into a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. 

Starting with the id: It's given as T2615, so that's straightforward.

Next, authors: There's one author listed, Matthew Waite, with his email and affiliation. Since the email is provided (waite@sptimes.com) and the news organization is St. Petersburg Times, I'll include both. So the authors array will have one object with name, email, and affiliation filled in.

Conference: The event is clearly stated as NICAR National Conference, so conference key will be "NICAR".

Year: The date range is March 9-12, 2006, so the year is 2006.

Title: Directly from the input, it's "Blogs, wikis and RSS in the newsroom".

Description: I need a concise summary. The tipsheet introduces blogging and wiki tools for newsrooms, mentioning specific software like WordPress, Moveable Type, SharePoint, MediaWiki, and Instiki. So the description should capture that it's about using these tools internally.

Keywords: Up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords are blogs, wikis, RSS, newsroom tools, and intranet platforms. That makes five, so I'll list them all.

Putting it all together, making sure each key is in quotes, and the structure follows JSON syntax correctly.
