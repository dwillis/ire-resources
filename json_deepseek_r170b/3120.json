Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON.

First, I'll assign the id as 3120 since that's specified. Next, looking at the authors section: there are three speakers listedâ€”Jim Steele, Joe Stephens, and Mike McGraw. Each of them has an email and affiliation. Jim is from Vanity Fair, so his affiliation is clear. Joe is with The Washington Post, and Mike is from The Kansas City Star. Their emails are also provided, so I'll include those.

The conference is IRE, held in Miami, Florida, in June 2008, so the year is 2008. The title of the tipsheet is "Unsung Documents." For the description, I need a concise summary. The main point is about using lesser-known documents in investigative reporting, combining them with other sources for better stories.

Keywords should be up to five relevant terms. From the content, "investigative journalism," "document research," "FOIA," and "public records" stand out as key topics.

I need to make sure all values are enclosed in quotes and that there are no markdown formats. The JSON structure should have keys like id, authors (as an array of objects with name, email, affiliation), conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

Double-checking each section: authors' details are correctly parsed, the description is a clear summary, and keywords are relevant without including the conference or author names. Everything looks good to structure into JSON as per instructions.
