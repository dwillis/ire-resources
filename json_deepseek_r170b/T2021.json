Alright, so I'm trying to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an IRE/NICAR conference. The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain, so I need to parse through the document carefully.

First, I'll look for the id. They want it as "T2021". That's straightforward. 

Next are the authors. The tipsheet lists several people with their names and contact info. Paul Overberg is the main author, with his email and affiliation to USA Today. Then there are others like Jeff Claasen from Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Dan Keating from Washington Post, etc. I'll need to structure each as an object within a list, ensuring that if any detail isn't present, it's marked as null.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE/NICAR", so that goes into the conference key. The year is 2004, which is explicitly mentioned in the text.

For the title, I'll extract the main heading which is "Using state highway crash databases". 

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet emphasizes using state crash data for journalism purposes beyond just fatal crashes, so I'll note that it's about analyzing injury and property damage crashes to find safety issues.

Keywords should be up to five relevant terms. I'll pick "highway safety", "crash databases", "enterprise reporting", "data analysis", and "public records".

I also need to make sure all keys are in quotes, and the structure follows the JSON format without any markdown or extra text. Let me double-check each part to ensure accuracy.
