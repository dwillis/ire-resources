Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, the id is fixed at 3057. Got that down. Next, authors are listed with name, email, and affiliation. Looking back at the text, I see Mark Katches from Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and Jennifer LaFleur from Dallas Morning News. Their emails are also provided, so I can include those.

Conference should be "IRE" since it's clearly stated as an IRE conference in February 2008. The year is 2008, which is explicitly mentioned, so that's straightforward.

The title of the tipsheet is "GETTING YOUR WORK NOTICED," so I'll use that exactly as provided. For the description, I need a concise summaryâ€”maybe something about strategies to raise the profile and effectiveness of CAR in the newsroom.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. The main topics here are CAR (Computer-Assisted Reporting), data analysis, newsroom management, training, and bylines. These seem relevant and cover the key points.

I have to make sure all keys and values are enclosed in quotes and that everything is in English as per instructions. Let me structure it properly without any markdown.
