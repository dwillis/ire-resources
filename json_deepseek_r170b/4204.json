Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an IRE conference. Let me go through this step by step.

First, I'll identify the key elements required: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

The id is given as 4204, so that's straightforward.

Next, for the authors, I see four names with their emails and affiliations. Each author entry should have name, email, and affiliation. I'll list them all as separate objects in an array.

Conference is mentioned as "IRE 2014", so the conference key will be "IRE" and the year is clearly 2014.

The title of the tipsheet is "Undercover on a budget".

For the description, it's a brief summary. The tipsheet talks about legal considerations, planning, equipment sources, etc., so I'll condense that into one or two sentences.

Keywords should be up to five terms. Looking at the content, relevant keywords might include undercover reporting, hidden cameras, investigative journalism, and budget equipment.

I also need to ensure all values are in English and correctly formatted with quotes.
