Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided specific instructions, so I should follow them carefully.

First, let's look at the structure they want: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is 5783 as specified.

Next, for the authors, there are three names mentioned: Patti DiVincenzo, Dana Amihere, and Youyou Zhou. Each of their affiliations is given right after their names in parentheses, so I can include those. Emails aren't provided, so they should be null. I'll list each author as an object within the authors array.

The conference is mentioned as being from IRE and NICAR, but according to the instructions, the conference key should be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Since both are part of the same event, perhaps it's better to just put "IRE" since that's the primary one. But wait, in the example provided earlier, they used "IRE and NICAR". Hmm, maybe I can include both as a single string if allowed.

Wait, looking back at the user's instruction: "The conference will be either 'IRE', 'NICAR' or 'Not Listed'." So it should be one of those. Since the tipsheet is from an IRE event featuring NICAR members, perhaps just "IRE" is sufficient because that's the main conference.

The year isn't mentioned anywhere in the text provided, so according to instructions, it should default to "Not Listed".

For the title, the given title is "Multi-Platform Checklist for Investigations", which seems straightforward. 

The description needs to be a concise summary of 1-2 sentences. The tipsheet covers promoting an investigative story before, during, and after publication across different platforms, so I can capture that.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Relevant keywords could include "investigative journalism", "multi-platform", "story promotion", "social media strategy", and "online presentation".

Putting it all together, ensuring all keys are in quotes and proper formatting is followed.
