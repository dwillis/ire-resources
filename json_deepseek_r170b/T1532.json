Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given me specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, I'll identify the id as "T1532" since that's specified. Next, for authors, there are two listed: Jean Packard from the Baltimore Sun and another without a name but with contact info at News Research Service. Since the second author's name isn't provided, their entry will have null for the name. The affiliation for both should be "Baltimore Sun" because that's the news organization mentioned.

The conference is NICAR as indicated at the end of the document. The year is 2002 since it's noted in the footer as 3/15/2002. 

For the title, I'll take "Fee Services for Information for Backgrounding" which seems to be the main heading. The description needs to summarize the content succinctly, so I'll mention that it compares services for background checks with details on costs and features.

Keywords should include relevant terms like fee services, backgrounding, investigative research, etc., making sure not to exceed five. 

I need to ensure all keys are in English and enclosed in quotes without any markdown formatting.
