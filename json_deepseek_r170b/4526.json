Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through this step by step.

First, the id is provided as 4526, so that's straightforward. The authors section needs each author's name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the text, I see three presenters: Jim Donovan from KYW-TV/Philadelphia with his email and Twitter handle; Cindy Galli from ABC News/New York with her contact info; and Randy Mac from KNBC/Los Angeles with his details.

Next, the conference is clearly stated as IRE 2015. The year is therefore 2015. The title of the session is "CONSUMER INVESTIGATIONS."

For the description, I need a concise summary of the tipsheet. It seems to focus on strategies for finding and maintaining good consumer stories through sources like tip lines, conferences, complaint websites, legal connections, and thorough background checks.

Keywords should be relevant terms that capture the essence without including the conference or authors' names. So, "consumer investigations," "story leads," "source building," "background checks," and "public records" seem appropriate.

I also need to make sure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Each key is straightforward, but I'll double-check for any missing info. For example, ensuring emails and affiliations are correctly matched to each author.

Finally, I'll structure the JSON with these elements, making sure it's valid and follows the specified format.
