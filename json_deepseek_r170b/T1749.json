Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about using property records for investigations from an IRE conference. The user provided specific instructions on the structure of the JSON, including keys like id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, I'll extract the necessary information from the input. The ID is given as T1749. The author's name is Brant Houston, with an email brant@ire.org and affiliation as Executive Director of IRE. So, the authors array will have one object with these details.

Next, the conference is clearly stated as IRE, and the year is October 2002, so those are straightforward. The title should be "Using Property Records for Investigations."

For the description, I need a concise summary. The input discusses various property records like deeds, tax assessments, and zoning applications. So, summarizing that into one or two sentences about using these records to track ownership and financial issues makes sense.

Keywords should include relevant terms without including the conference or authors. From the content, "property records," "investigations," "tax assessments," "zoning," and "financial issues" are key topics.

I'll structure all of this into a JSON object, ensuring proper syntax with quotes and commas. No markdown is needed, just plain JSON.
