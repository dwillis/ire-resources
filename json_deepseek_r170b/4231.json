Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the id is given as 4231, so that's straightforward. Next, looking at the authors section: there are no specific names mentioned in the text. So I'll set "name" to null for both entries since we can't make up names. The email and affiliation will also be null because there's no information provided about them.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that goes into the "conference" field. The year isn't mentioned anywhere in the text, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

For the title, the main topic seems to be about choosing the best stories and executing investigative projects effectively, especially referencing the "Deadly Delays" example. So a suitable title would be "Choosing the Best Stories and Execution for Investigative Projects".

The description needs to be a concise summary in 1-2 sentences. The text emphasizes identifying key questions, allocating resources, and the importance of thorough execution. It also mentions the impact of such projects on society.

Looking at keywords, I should extract relevant terms without including the conference or authors. Key themes include "investigative journalism", "story selection", "resource allocation", "execution", and "impact". That makes five keywords which fit well.

Putting it all together, each field is filled accordingly ensuring that all values are in English and enclosed in quotes as required.
