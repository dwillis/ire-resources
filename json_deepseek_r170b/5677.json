Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has provided specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with particular keys.

First, I'll start by identifying each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. 

The id is straightforward; it's given as 5677. Next, for the authors section, I need to list each author with their name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the input, there are three authors: Nicole Vap, Lynn Walsh, and Rick Yarborough. Their emails and affiliations are provided, so I can fill those in directly.

The conference is mentioned as "IRE" since it's an Investigative Reporters and Editors conference. The year isn't explicitly stated, but looking at the content, there are references to 2016, 2017, and 2018, which could indicate the conference took place around that time. However, without a specific year provided, I'll set it to "Not Listed".

The title of the session is clearly given as "Behind Bulletproofing - Building Trust in a 'Fake News' World". For the description, I need a concise summary. The main focus seems to be on strategies journalists can use to build trust with their audiences and combat the perception of fake news. So, the description will reflect that.

Keywords should be no more than five terms excluding conference and authors. Relevant keywords from the content include "trust-building", "fake news", "journalism credibility", "audience engagement", and "media trust".

I'll structure all these elements into a JSON object, ensuring each key is correctly formatted with quotation marks and proper syntax. I also need to make sure that values are enclosed in quotes and that any null values are handled appropriately, though in this case, all authors have complete information.

Now, putting it all together step by step:

1. Set id to 5677.
2. Create an authors array with each author's details.
3. Assign conference as "IRE".
4. Year is set to "Not Listed" since no specific year was given.
5. Title is taken directly from the input.
6. Description is a brief summary of the session's focus.
7. Keywords are selected based on content relevance.

Finally, I'll ensure that all syntax is correct and that there are no typos or formatting issues in the JSON structure.
