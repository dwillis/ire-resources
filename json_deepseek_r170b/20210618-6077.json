Okay, I need to help the user by creating a JSON object based on their specific query. They provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference about reporting on police use of force.

First, I'll start by identifying the key elements they want in the JSON: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The id is given as 6077. 

Next, for the authors, there are three people listed: Mark Greenblatt, Rosie Cima, and Nick McMillan. Each has a Twitter handle and email. I'll structure each author with name, email, and affiliation. The affiliations come from their emails or mentioned organizations, like E.W. Scripps Investigative Team for Mark and Rosie. Nick's affiliation isn't directly provided, so it's null.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's straightforward. The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the query, so I'll set it to "Not Listed".

For the title, I see it's about reporting on use of force, so I'll use a concise version of that.

The description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary. It should mention the FBI's data collection progress, alternative datasets, and how to localize the story for any market.

Keywords are important and limited to five terms. They include "police accountability", "transparency", "FBI data", "use of force reporting", and "journalism investigations".

I'll make sure all values are in English and enclosed in quotes as per their instructions.
