Alright, I need to help this user by creating a JSON object from their provided tipsheet. Let me first understand what they're asking for.

They mentioned that the response should only be a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The ID is given as 3058. 

Looking at the content, I see Terri Langford from the Houston Chronicle presented this at NICAR 2008 in Houston. So, under authors, her name, email, and affiliation should be included. Her email is provided, so that goes there.

The conference is clearly stated as NICAR 2008/Houston, so the conference key will be "NICAR". The year is 2008 since it's part of NICAR 2008.

For the title, it's "Better Record Requests." The description needs to be a concise summary. I'll go with tips for effectively obtaining public records by understanding laws and strategies.

Keywords should include terms like public records, FOIA, exemptions, etc., but limited to five and excluding conference names or authors.

I also need to make sure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. No markdown, just the JSON object.
