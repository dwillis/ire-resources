Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the user specified that the id should be 4236. That's straightforward. 

Next, looking at the authors section: The name listed is Ellen Gabler. Her email is egabler@jrn.com and her affiliation is Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. So I'll include all three in an object within the authors array.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that goes into the conference key. The year isn't mentioned anywhere in the text, so it should be "Not Listed".

For the title, the tipsheet is titled "Deadly Delays", which I can take directly from the provided content.

The description needs to be a concise summary of 1-2 sentences. The tipsheet provides advice on investigative reporting techniques like finding sources and persisting when sources are unresponsive. So the description should reflect that.

Keywords are up to five relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, "investigative journalism", "source cultivation", "reporting techniques", and "persistence" seem appropriate. I'll include these four as they capture the essence without exceeding the limit.

I also need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. No markdown is allowed, so just a plain JSON structure with correct syntax.

```json

    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Deadly Delays",
  "description": "This tipsheet provides advice on investigative reporting techniques, including finding sources, persisting when sources are unresponsive, and thorough fact-checking.",
  "keywords": [

    "reporting techniques",
    "persistence"
