Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id is given as 5314, so that's straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors. The last slide mentions a contact with email bmccarthy@kycir.org, phone number, and Twitter handle @bmccarthykycir. Since there's no name provided, I'll set "name": null. The affiliation isn't explicitly mentioned, but since the email is from kycir.org, that's the news organization, so the affiliation will be "KyCIR".

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE" in the contact information.

For the year, there's no specific mention of when this conference took place, so I'll set it to "Not Listed".

The title of the tipsheet is provided at the top: "Building An Accountability Culture In The Newsroom".

Now, the description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet talks about three steps for building an accountability cultureâ€”understanding mission, using watchdog skills, and institutionalizing practices. So I'll condense that into a concise summary.

Keywords should be no more than five terms related to the content but excluding the conference and authors. Relevant terms here are "Accountability", "Watchdog journalism", "Newsroom culture", "FOIA", and "Investigative reporting".

Putting it all together, I structure each key with appropriate values ensuring everything is in English and properly enclosed in quotes.
