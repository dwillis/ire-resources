Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's instructions. Let me first understand what they're asking for.

The input text seems to be from an annual conference, probably IRE given the context, but I should confirm that. The title isn't explicitly stated, so I'll note it as "Not Listed." 

Looking for authors: the text mentions a speaker named Holly Hacker. Since there's no other author mentioned, the authors list will have one entry with her name. Her email and affiliation aren't provided, so those fields will be null.

The conference is identified as IRE because of the context clues like "IRE Annual Conference." 

For the year, it's not clearly stated in the text, so I'll mark that as "Not Listed."

The description needs to be a concise summary. The main points are tips and story ideas for investigative education reporting covering K-12 and higher ed topics.

Keywords should include up to five relevant terms: Education Reporting, Investigative Journalism, K-12 Education, Higher Education, Financial Aid.

I need to structure all this into a JSON object with the specified keys and ensure all values are correctly formatted. Let me double-check each field to make sure I didn't miss anything.

    {
      "name": null,

    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Not Listed",
  "description": "A summary of tips and story ideas for investigative reporting on education topics, including K-12 and higher education issues.",
  "keywords": [
