Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference titled "Social Media Sleuthing." They want me to create a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, I'll assign the id as 3650. The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's straightforward. The year isn't mentioned in the provided text, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed." 

Next, the title of the tipsheet is "Social Media Sleuthing," which I can directly use. For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet discusses using social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn for investigative reporting, such as finding sources, tracking individuals, and gathering information. So, the description should reflect that.

Now, the authors section is a bit tricky. There are multiple speakers listed: Doug Haddix from IRE, Paula Lavigne from ESPN, Courtney Mabeus from Frederick News Post, Andrew McIntosh from QMI News Agency, Steve Sternberg from U.S. News & World Report, Seth Slabaugh from The Star Press, Kate Martin from Skagit Valley Herald, Andrew Welsh-Huggins from Associated Press, Holly Hacker from Dallas Morning News, Tim Sandler from NBC News, and Leo Shane from Stars and Stripes.

Each author needs to be an object with name, email, and affiliation. Since emails aren't provided, I'll leave them as null. Affiliations are the news organizations mentioned next to their names. For example, Doug Haddix is affiliated with IRE, Paula Lavigne with ESPN, etc. 

For keywords, I need up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking through the content, relevant keywords would be "social media," "investigative journalism," "source tracking," "public records," and "online surveillance."

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part carefully to ensure accuracy. Each author's name is included as listed, with their respective affiliations. The description captures the essence of using social media for investigative purposes without being too lengthy.

Finally, I'll make sure everything is in English, keys are correctly named, and the JSON syntax is valid. No values should be made up; if information isn't available, it's left as null or "Not Listed."
