Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from James Hamilton at the Stanford Journalism Program. Let's break down each part step by step.

First, the ID is given as 5191. That's straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors section. The main author mentioned is James Hamilton. His email is listed as jayth@stanford.edu, and his affiliation is clearly Stanford Journalism Program. So I can fill that in without any issues.

The conference is specified as IRE because it's from Investigative Reporters and Editors conferences.

For the year, since there's no specific date mentioned in the input, I'll set it to "Not Listed".

The title of the tipsheet is "Lessons from Democracy’s Detectives". That seems clear.

Now, the description needs to be a concise 1-2 sentence summary. The text discusses why investigative reporting is underprovided and how new data and algorithms can help. So I'll summarize that.

Keywords should be up to five terms. From the content, "investigative journalism", "data journalism", "algorithms", "FOIA", and "government accountability" are all relevant.

I need to ensure all keys and values are in English and enclosed in quotes. Also, avoid making up any information not provided. Double-checking for any missing details, but it seems everything is covered.

Putting it all together, the JSON should accurately reflect each part as specified.
