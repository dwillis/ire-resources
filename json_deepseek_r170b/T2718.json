Alright, so I'm looking at this user query where they provided a chunk of text about investigative reporting tips. They want me to create a JSON object from that input with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First off, the id is straightforward—T2718. That part's easy. Next up, authors. The text doesn't mention any names, so I'll have to leave name as null. Email and affiliation can also be null since there’s no info provided about them either. If it had mentioned a news org, I’d use that for affiliation, but nothing here.

Now, the conference key needs to be "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". The text starts with "Breaking and Entering," which is an IRE (Investigative Reporters & Editors) conference panel. So, conference should be "IRE".

The year isn't specified anywhere in the provided text, so that will be "Not Listed" as well.

For the title, it's already given at the top: "Breaking and Entering." Perfect, no issues there.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The text is about investigative tips covering sources like government agencies, court records, and financial documents. It also mentions using online databases for research. So I'll craft a 1-2 sentence summary that captures the essence without getting too detailed.

Keywords are next. They should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking through the text, key topics include "investigative reporting", "public records", "court documents", "financial records", and " Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)". These seem relevant and fit within the limit.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with each key filled appropriately based on this analysis. Make sure everything is in English as per instructions and properly enclosed in quotes.
