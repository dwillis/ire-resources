Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain. Let me go through this step by step.

First, I'll identify the ID. It's specified as "Breaking_Disaster" because that seems to be the main topic of the tipsheet.

Next, looking at the authors section. The tipsheet mentions Jaimi Dowdell and Doug Haddix from IRE. Since they're both from IRE, their affiliation will be "IRE". There are no emails provided, so those fields can remain null.

For the conference, since it's from IRE, that key is straightforwardâ€”it should be "IRE".

The year isn't mentioned anywhere in the text, so according to the instructions, I'll set it as "Not Listed".

Now, the title of the tipsheet seems to be about strategies for breaking news and disaster reporting. So a suitable title would be "Breaking News and Disaster Reporting Strategies."

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers planning, resources, and quick-hit stories for journalists covering disasters. So I can write something like: "This tipsheet provides strategies for journalists on covering breaking news and disasters, including planning, resource management, and quick-hit story ideas."

For keywords, I need up to five terms excluding the conference name and authors. Relevant keywords here could be "disaster reporting," "breaking news," "journalism strategies," "quick-hit stories," and "resource management." These capture the essence of the tipsheet.

Putting it all together, each key has its corresponding value based on the provided content and instructions.
