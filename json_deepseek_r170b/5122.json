Okay, I need to help the user by creating a JSON object based on their provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions, so I should make sure to follow them closely.

First, I'll identify all the required keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 5122, which I'll include directly.

Next, looking at the authors section. The tipsheet was presented by Maria Polletta, who works for The Arizona Republic. Her contact information is provided, so I can fill in her name, email, and affiliation. There's no other author mentioned, so the authors array will only have one entry.

The conference is specified as "IRE" since it's an IRE event. As for the year, the tipsheet doesn't mention a specific year, so I'll set that to "Not Listed".

The title of the session is clear: "SOURCE-BUILDING IN MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES: Why you can’t swoop in and expect to get the scoop". That's straightforward.

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet focuses on building trust with communities by being authentic, avoiding parachute journalism, and engaging through social media. So, I'll craft a 1-2 sentence summary capturing that essence.

Now, the keywords should be relevant and limited to five. The main points are source-building, marginalized communities, parachute journalism, diversity, and community engagement. These seem appropriate and cover the content well.

I need to ensure all values are in English and enclosed in quotes. Also, since the year isn't provided, it's set to "Not Listed".

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with each key properly filled out, making sure not to include any made-up names or incorrect affiliations.
