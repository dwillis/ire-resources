Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let's break down what each part requires.

First, the id should be 2882 as specified. The authors section is a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the input, David Wethe is listed with his email and affiliation as Fort Worth Star-Telegram. So that's straightforward.

Next, the conference is IRE since it's from their event. The year isn't provided in the text, so I'll set it to "Not Listed". 

For the title, the tipsheet is about covering businesses with and without profit, so I translated that into English as "Covering Businesses with and Without Profit".

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet provides resources for investigating business backgrounds, so I wrote that it offers key resources for reporters.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. The relevant terms here are 'business investigations', 'nonprofit organizations', 'public records', 'SEC filings', and 'private companies'.

I made sure all values are in English except where the original text is different, but since most was in Spanish, I translated where necessary. All keys and string values are enclosed in quotes as per JSON standards.

Finally, everything is structured properly with each key having the correct data type, especially authors being a list of objects.
