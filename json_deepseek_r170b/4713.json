Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down what's required step by step.

First, looking at the input, it's about how to cover local elections, specifically using Jefferson County as a case study. The main points include the district's size, a conservative takeover, community backlash, campaign finance complexities, and why local elections matter. There are also takeaways like knowing election laws, connections between local and national issues, and the importance of context in reporting.

The JSON structure needs to have the keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 4713. 

For the authors, I see Nic Garcia listed with his email and affiliation with Chalkbeat. So, the authors list should include him. Since there are no other authors mentioned, the list has only one entry.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's straightforward. The year isn't provided in the input, so it'll be "Not Listed".

The title of the tipsheet seems to be "Lessons from Jefferson County: How to cover a local election — and why it matters."

The description needs to be a concise summary. It should mention covering local elections, using Jeffco as an example, and the significance due to national influences.

Keywords are up to five terms. From the content, relevant keywords could be "local elections", "education reform", "campaign finance", "Jefferson County", and "school boards".

Putting it all together, I need to ensure each key is correctly filled with accurate information, avoiding any made-up data. All values should be in English and properly quoted.
