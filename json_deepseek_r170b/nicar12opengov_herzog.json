Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided query. Let's start by understanding what's required.

The user wants a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The input given is a document from David Herzog of the Reynolds Journalism Institute, who was a 2010-2011 Donald W. Reynolds Fellow. His Twitter handle is @OpenMissouri.

First, I need to extract relevant information: the title of the session or project, which seems to be about opening government data in Missouri. The authors are mentioned as David Herzog with his email and affiliation.

Next, the conference isn't explicitly stated, but since it's from IRE, that should be the value. The year is 2010-2011, so I'll use 2011 as the main year.

For the description, I need a concise summary in simple terms about making government data accessible to various groups.

Keywords should include public data, transparency, open government, and others relevant but limited to five.

Now, putting it all together into the required JSON structure with specified keys. Make sure each field is correctly formatted and enclosed in quotes.
