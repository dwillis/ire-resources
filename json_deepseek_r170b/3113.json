Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The user provided specific instructions with several key points.

First, the structure requires an id of 3113. Then, authors should be a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. In this case, only Jim Strickland is mentioned as the speaker from WSB-TV, so I'll include him without an email since it's not provided.

Next, the conference is clearly stated as "IRE" because it's an IRE event. The year isn't specified in the text, so I'll set that to "Not Listed".

The title of the tipsheet is given as "Parachuting In: How Investigators Can Enhance Coverage of the Big Story". 

For the description, I need a concise 1-2 sentence summary. The content talks about using investigative tools during breaking news and providing depth to big stories through sources and experts. So, I'll capture that essence succinctly.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. From the text, relevant keywords are "Breaking News", "Investigative Journalism", "Newsroom Management", "Source Development", and "Expert Sources".

I need to make sure all keys and string values are in English and enclosed in quotes. I'll structure the JSON accordingly without any markdown formatting as per the user's request.

Double-checking everything, the authors section is correctly filled with Jim Strickland and his affiliation. All other fields align with the instructions provided.
