Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON.

First, looking at the input, there's a section about Dakota Flournoy from Storyful. So the author's name is Dakota Flournoy, email is Dakota.flournoy@storyful.com, and affiliation is Storyful.

The title of the tipsheet seems to be "How investigative journalists can be better equipped to navigate misinformation and disinformation."

Next, the conference is IRE since it's mentioned at the top. The year isn't provided, so I'll set that as "Not Listed."

For the description, I need a concise summary in 1-2 sentences. It should explain how the tipsheet helps journalists avoid falling for false information spread by trolls and includes strategies like trusting instincts and thorough research.

Keywords are up to five terms related to the content. They include misinformation, disinformation, investigative journalism, source hacking, and trolls.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part accordingly. Make sure all keys are in quotes and values as well, with proper syntax for the JSON.
