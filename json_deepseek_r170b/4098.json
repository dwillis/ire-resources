Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, I'll start by identifying the id, which is given as 4098. That's straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors section. The tipsheet mentions Paul Overberg from USA TODAY. Since there are no other authors listed, the authors array will have only one object. His name is Paul Overberg, and his affiliation is USA TODAY. There's no email provided, so that field will be null.

The conference is specified as IRE because the user mentioned it's from an Investigative Reporters and Editors conferences. The year is 2014, as indicated in the tipsheet.

For the title, it's "Data Deep Dives I: Behind the Bloodshed: The Untold Story of America’s Mass Killings." That's a bit long, but it accurately reflects the content.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about analyzing data on mass killings, questioning sources, and the process involved in such investigations. So I'll phrase that into a 1-2 sentence summary.

Keywords should be no more than five terms. From the content, relevant keywords would be "mass killings," "data analysis," "investigative journalism," "FBI data," and "homicide reports." These capture the main topics without including the conference or authors.

I'll make sure all keys are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Each value is also in English since the original text is in English.

Putting it all together, I structure each part step by step to ensure nothing is missed.
