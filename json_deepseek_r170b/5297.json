Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's instructions from the given tipsheet. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, the id should be 5297 as specified. Next, looking at the authors: Sarah Hutchins is listed with an affiliation of IRE & NICAR and her Twitter handle @sarhutch. Since there are no other authors mentioned, the authors list will have only one entry with her name, null email, and the affiliation as "IRE & NICAR".

The conference is either IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed. Here, both IRE and NICAR are mentioned, so I'll note that in the JSON under conference.

The year isn't provided in the text, so it will be "Not Listed".

For the title, the tipsheet covers web searches and social media tools for journalists, so a suitable title would be "Web Searches & Social Media for Journalists".

The description needs to be concise. I'll summarize that it's about tools and techniques for investigative journalism using search engines and social platforms.

Keywords should include relevant terms like "web search", "social media", "investigative journalism", "verification tools", and "backgrounding techniques" without exceeding five items.

Putting it all together, the JSON structure takes shape with each key filled appropriately.

    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Web Searches & Social Media for Journalists",
  "description": "A tipsheet covering tools and techniques for investigative journalists using search engines and social media platforms.",
  "keywords": [
