Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on this tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors conferences. The user provided detailed instructions, and I have to make sure I follow them carefully.

First, the id is given as 4216. That's straightforward. Next, the authors section should be a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. But in this case, there are no specific authors mentioned in the tipsheet. The original text doesn't list any names, so I'll leave the name as null for each entry. Since there's no email or affiliation provided either, those will also be null.

Now, the conference is specified as "IRE" because it's from Investigative Reporters and Editors, which is associated with IRE conferences. The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the text, so according to the instructions, I'll set it to "Not Listed".

For the title, the tipsheet itself doesn't have a specific title, but since it's about strategies for investigative journalists, I can infer a suitable title like "Investigative Reporting Strategies and Resources."

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers various resources and strategies for journalists, so I'll phrase it as a 1-2 sentence overview of that.

Keywords should be no more than five terms. Looking at the content, appropriate keywords would include "investigative journalism," "reporting resources," "journalist tools," "research strategies," and "media resources."

I need to ensure all keys are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. I'll structure everything accordingly without adding any made-up information.

Finally, I'll double-check that the JSON syntax is correct, with proper commas and brackets, so it's valid when parsed.
