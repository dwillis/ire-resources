Okay, I'm trying to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through this step by step.

First, I need to identify the key elements required for the JSON structure: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The ID is provided as T1847, so that's straightforward.

Looking at the authors section, the tipsheet was produced by Alan C. Miller, Kevin Sack, and Janet Lundblad from the Los Angeles Times. Since their emails aren't listed, I'll set email to null for each author.

The conference is clearly stated as the IRE National Conference in Washington, D.C., which took place in 2003. So, the conference key will be "IRE" and the year is 2003.

For the title, the tipsheet is titled "Military Aviation Investigation Coordinates." 

Next, the description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet provides contacts and resources for investigating military aviation incidents, so I'll phrase it as a one-sentence overview of that.

Keywords should be relevant terms that capture the essence without including the conference or authors. Terms like "military," "aviation," "investigation," "safety data," and "FOIA" seem appropriate.

I also need to ensure all values are in English, which they are, and properly formatted with quotes. No markdown is allowed in the final response, just a clean JSON object.

Let me double-check each field to make sure I didn't miss any details or misattribute any information. Everything seems accounted for.
