Alright, let me try to figure out how to create this JSON object based on the user's query and the provided tipsheet content.

First, I see that the user has given specific instructions for converting a set of conference notes into a structured JSON format with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is fixed as 5323, so that part is straightforward.

Looking at the authors section, there's only one author mentioned, Denise Malan, who works at Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE). Her email is denise@ire.org. So I'll create an object for her with name, email, and affiliation. Since her affiliation isn't explicitly stated but she's from IRE, I can use that.

Next, the conference is clearly listed as IRE in the document, so that goes into the conference field. The year isn't specified anywhere in the text, so according to instructions, it should be "Not Listed".

For the title, it's mentioned as "Web search & social media for investigators", which fits perfectly.

The description needs to be a concise summary of 1-2 sentences. The tipsheet covers strategies for effective web searching and social media investigations, including tools and techniques. So I'll summarize that.

Keywords should be no more than five terms. From the content, relevant keywords include "web search", "social media", "investigative journalism", "research strategies", and "verification".

I need to ensure all keys are in quotes and that there's no made-up information. Denise Malan's name is given, so her author object will have her details, while others aren't mentioned, so they remain null.

Putting it all together, I structure the JSON with each key properly assigned based on the analysis.

```json

  "id": 5323,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Denise Malan",
      "email": "denise@ire.org",
      "affiliation": "Investigative Reporters and Editors"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Web search & social media for investigators",
  "description": "A tipsheet on strategies for effective web searching, social media investigations, and research techniques for journalists.",
  "keywords": [
    "web search",
    "social media",
    "investigative journalism",
    "research strategies",
    "verification"
  ]
}
```
