Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's instructions. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the user provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The id should be 3295 as specified. 

Next, looking at the authors section: Ryan Gabrielson is listed with his contact info. His name is given, so I'll include that. The email and phone number are provided, but since the user didn't ask for phone, I'll focus on email. The affiliation isn't explicitly stated next to his name, but he's from East Valley Tribune, which is a news organization, so that becomes his affiliation.

The conference is clearly an IRE event because the footer mentions "Investigative Reporters and Editors, Inc." So the conference key will be "IRE".

The year isn't directly mentioned in the text, so according to instructions, it should be "Not Listed". 

For the title, the tipsheet's heading is about scouring syllabi to check if colleges are teaching successfully. I'll condense that into a concise title.

The description needs to be 1-2 sentences summarizing the content. The tipsheet talks about using graduation rates, tests like CLA, and curriculum investigations. So the summary should cover these points succinctly.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Relevant terms are graduation rates, testing assessments, curriculum investigation, academic performance, and educational accountability.

I also need to ensure all keys and values are in English and properly quoted. No markdown, just a clean JSON structure as per the example provided.
