Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down the requirements step by step.

First, I'll look at the structure required: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 4206. That's straightforward.

Next, the authors section needs to be a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. In the input, there's only one author mentioned: Jack Gillum from The Associated Press, with his email jgillum@ap.org and Twitter handle @jackgillum. Since there are no other authors listed, I'll create an array with just this one object.

The conference is specified as IRE because that's where the tipsheet is from. The year isn't mentioned in the input, so I'll default to "Not Listed".

For the title, the main heading is about negotiating for data and federal records, so I'll make that concise: "Tips When Negotiating for Data and Federal Records."

The description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet covers strategies for effectively filing FOIA requests, dealing with delays, and what to do when requests are denied. So I'll summarize it as advice on negotiating data and federal records requests, handling issues, and understanding common excuses.

Keywords should be up to five terms. From the content, relevant keywords include FOIA, data requests, federal records, delays, and exemptions.

Now, putting this all together into a JSON structure with proper syntax and ensuring all keys are in quotes.

    {
      "name": "Jack Gillum",
      "email": "jgillum@ap.org",
      "affiliation": "The Associated Press"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Tips When Negotiating for Data and Federal Records",
  "description": "Advice on effectively negotiating data and federal records requests, handling delays, and understanding common excuses.",
  "keywords": ["FOIA", "data requests", "federal records", "delays", "exemptions"]
}
```
