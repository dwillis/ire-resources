Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to create this JSON object based on the user's instructions and the provided tipsheet from the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through it step by step.

First, I need to identify all the required keys in the JSON: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 5726, so that's straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors section. It says it should be a list of elements with name, email, and affiliation. I see Kate Howard is mentioned multiple times in the tipsheet, along with her Twitter handle @journokateh. However, there's no email or explicit affiliation listed for her. The tipsheet mentions the Florida Times-Union, so I can use that as her affiliation.

Moving on to conference. The tipsheet has "IRE 2018" at the top, so conference is definitely "IRE", and the year is clearly 2018.

The title of the presentation is "Perfecting your 15-minute background check - and why you should do it every time".

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet emphasizes the importance of always conducting background checks on sources, even if they seem trustworthy. It provides various methods like Google searches, checking court records, social media, etc., and stresses having a system in place.

Now, the keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords would include "background check", "investigative journalism", "source verification", "journalism tips", and "research methods".

I think that covers everything needed for the JSON structure without adding any made-up information. I'll make sure all values are in English and properly quoted.
