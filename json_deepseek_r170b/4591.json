Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors conference. Let me break down what's required step by step.

First, the structure should have specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is fixed at 4591, so that part is straightforward.

Next, looking at the content provided. There are two main sections: one titled "Managing the Broadcast Team" with a speaker's details and another with seven tips for managing an investigative team. 

For the authors section, it mentions Jennifer Cobb, her email, and Twitter handle. Her affiliation isn't explicitly stated in the text after her name, but KHOU-TV is mentioned elsewhere as part of the first line "Jennifer Cobb, Executive Producer of Investigation at KHOU-TV". So, I can use KHOU-TV as her affiliation.

The conference is IRE since it's from Investigative Reporters and Editors. The year isn't provided in the text, so I'll put "Not Listed".

The title should capture the essence, which seems to be about managing an investigative team. Maybe something like "Managing an Investigative Team Effectively". 

For the description, it needs a concise summary. Since the tips focus on how to lead and inspire team members, I can phrase it as advice on leadership strategies for investigative teams.

Keywords should reflect the main topics: investigative journalism, leadership, teamwork, collaboration, broadcast management. That's five terms, which fits the requirement.

I need to ensure all values are in English and enclosed in quotes. Also, since the year isn't listed, I'll set that to "Not Listed".

Putting it all together, each part of the JSON is filled out based on the provided content without adding any extra information or making up data.
