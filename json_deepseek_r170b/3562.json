Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided specific instructions, so let me break down each step carefully.

First, the structure should have keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is 3562 as specified.

Looking at the content, I see two authors mentioned towards the end: Stephen Stock from CBS4 WFOR-TV, Miami with email sstock@cbs.com, and Agustin Armendariz from California Watch with email aarmendariz@californiawatch.org. So the authors array will have these two entries.

The conference is clearly labeled as an IRE conference since the user provided that context, so conference key is "IRE". The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the text, so it should be "Not Listed".

The title of the tipsheet seems to be "Before the Storm Hits" based on the repeated headings. 

For the description, I need a concise 1-2 sentence summary. The content mainly talks about preparing for natural disasters with investigations and tools, so something like: "A tipsheet on preparing investigative coverage for natural disasters, including planning, tools, and post-event investigations."

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Relevant terms are disaster preparedness, investigative reporting, FEMA, building codes, and emergency management.

Putting it all together, ensuring that the JSON syntax is correct with proper quotes and commas.
