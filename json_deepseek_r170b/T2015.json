Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, the user provided a detailed description of a session titled "Keeping Government Accountable: Following the Money" by Dan Keating from The Washington Post at NICAR in March 2004. They want this information transformed into a specific JSON format with keys like id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

I'll start by assigning each part of the data to the corresponding key. The ID is given as T2015. For authors, there's only Dan Keating mentioned. Since his email isn't provided, it should be null, and his affiliation is clearly The Washington Post.

The conference is NICAR, which I know stands for National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting. The year is explicitly March 2004, so that goes into the year field.

Next, the title is straightforward: "Keeping Government Accountable: Following the Money." 

For the description, I need a concise summary. The session focuses on using procurement data and contracts to hold governments accountable, so I'll phrase it simply as tracking government spending through procurement data and contracts.

Keywords should be relevant but not too many. I'll choose procurement, government accountability, contracts, investigative reporting, and public records since they capture the essence of the tipsheet without overlapping with the conference or author names.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. No made-up data, so if something's missing like an email, it stays null. Also, make sure the JSON structure is valid with commas separating each key-value pair and proper braces.

Putting it all together, I should have a clean JSON object that accurately reflects the provided information without any markdown formatting as per the user's instructions.
