Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, I'll start by assigning the id as 4964 since that's specified. Next, under authors, there's one author mentioned: Topher Sanders. His email is provided, topher.sanders@propublica.org, and his affiliation is ProPublica. So I'll structure the authors array with these details.

The conference isn't explicitly stated in the text, but given the content and the mention of an investigative focus, it's safe to assume this is from an IRE conference. Therefore, the conference key will be "IRE". 

Looking for the year, thereâ€™s no specific mention or indication within the provided text about when the conference took place, so the year should be set to "Not Listed".

The title of the tipsheet seems to be "Finding, Developing and Keeping Sources" based on the first line. For the description, I need a concise 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. The tipsheet focuses on strategies for developing sources through research, building relationships, and effective communication methods. So I'll craft a brief summary that encapsulates these points.

Keywords are next, and they should be no more than five terms excluding conference or authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords would include "sourcing", "investigative journalism", "research techniques", "source development", and "journalism ethics".

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed within quotes. I'll double-check each part of the JSON structure to make sure it aligns with the user's instructions, especially ensuring that authors' details are correctly formatted as an array with their respective attributes.

Finally, I'll review the entire JSON object to confirm accuracy and adherence to the guidelines provided.
