Okay, so I have to create a JSON object based on the given input. Let me go through this step by step.

First, looking at the input, there's an ID number which is #3704. That should translate directly to "id": 3704 in the JSON.

Next, the authors section. The input has several lines with information about a person. I see Alison Young listed with her email and affiliation as USA TODAY. So under authors, this will be an array with one object containing name: "Alison Young", email: "ayoung@usatoday.com", and affiliation: "USA TODAY".

The conference isn't explicitly mentioned in the input, but given that it's from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE), I can safely assume the conference is "IRE".

For the year, there's no specific date or year provided in the text. So the year should be "Not Listed".

The title of the tipsheet seems to be about using online platforms for investigative storytelling, so I'll use that as the title.

Now the description needs to be a concise summary. The input talks about gathering content like video, audio, photos, data, and documents early on. It also mentions brainstorming with developers throughout the reporting process and integrating digital concepts with investigation findings. So a 1-2 sentence summary would capture these points.

Keywords should exclude the conference and authors but include relevant terms from the text. The input mentions online platforms, content gathering, interactive storytelling, digital integration, SEO, social media, and team collaboration. I'll pick up to five of these that best represent the content.

Putting it all together, ensuring all keys are in quotes and values are correctly formatted.
