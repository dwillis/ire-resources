Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, the id is given as 4685, so that's straightforward. Next, looking at authors, the tipsheet mentions Reg Chua with his email and affiliation as Reuters. Then there are Jacqui Maher and David Caswell. Their emails and affiliations aren't provided, so I'll leave those as null.

The conference is clearly IRE since it's from their event. The year isn't mentioned in the text, so I'll put "Not Listed". The title is "Structured Journalism Tip Sheet" which is clear from the document.

For the description, I need a 1-2 sentence summary. Structured journalism involves organizing news as data for better digital presentation and consumer interaction. That's the main idea, so I can condense that into a concise statement.

Keywords should be up to five terms related to the content but excluding the conference name and authors. From the tipsheet, relevant keywords are "structured journalism", "data journalism", "knowledge representation", "news products", and "digital news". These capture the essence without overlapping with other excluded terms.

I think that covers all the required fields. Now I'll structure this into a JSON object as per the specifications.
