Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided input for an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let's break down the requirements step by step.

First, looking at the input, it starts with "Doctors & Sex Abuse," which seems to be the title of the tipsheet. Then there are some notes about data issues—too much or too little—and a mention of Jeff who suggests using computers for analysis. The number 100,000 reducing to 10,000 indicates they filtered the data.

Next, the content describes various cases of sex abuse by different medical professionals like OB/GYNs and psychiatrists. It mentions that many doctors continued practicing with minimal consequences, which is shocking. The notes also highlight systemic issues like hospitals not reporting incidents and victims being diverse in age and background.

There's a slide about digitization, which probably relates to how they handled the data overload. Finding victims and visually challenged might refer to methodologies or challenges faced during the investigation.

At the end, there's contact information for Shawn McIntosh from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The authors list should include him with his email and affiliation.

The JSON structure requires specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. 

- **id**: Given as "Narrative_in_the_Numbers".
- **authors**: A list where each entry has name, email, affiliation. Since only Shawn is mentioned, others are null.
- **conference**: Based on the context, it's likely IRE, but since not explicitly stated, maybe "Not Listed". But given the mention of Jeff and digitization, which relates to NICAR (National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting), perhaps conference should be "NICAR".
- **year**: Not provided, so "Not Listed".
- **title**: From the input, it's "Doctors & Sex Abuse".
- **description**: Needs a concise summary. The investigation uncovered widespread abuse by doctors who faced minimal consequences.
- **keywords**: Up to five relevant terms: sexual abuse, doctors, medical professionals, underreporting, accountability.

Putting this all together, I need to structure the JSON correctly with proper syntax and ensure all fields are included as specified. Make sure emails and affiliations are accurate where possible and handle any missing information appropriately.
