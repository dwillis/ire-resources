Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given query. The user has provided specific instructions about the structure and content of this JSON.

First, I should identify the id as 3036. Then, look at the authors section. There's one author mentioned: Nils Mulvad with his email and affiliation. So, the authors list will have one object with name, email, and affiliation filled in.

Next, the conference is NICAR because it's mentioned as "Nicar-conference". The year is 2008 since the date provided is February 29, 2008. 

The title should be a concise version of the panel name, so I'll use "Robots and RSS-feeds" from the given text.

For the description, I need to summarize the content in 1-2 sentences. The main points are using robots for data scraping, sending RSS feeds, and sharing databases with other media. So, I can write something like: "The presentation covers the use of robots for continuous data scraping from official websites, sending RSS-feeds to wire agencies, and sharing databases with other media organizations."

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking at the text, relevant keywords are Robots, RSS-feeds, Data Scraping, MySQL, Linux, Cronjobs, Microsoft Access, ODBC, Wire Agencies, Altinget, Kapowtech, OpenKapow, Real Estate Records, Court Records, Parliament Data.

Wait, that's more than five. I need to pick the most relevant ones. Robots, RSS-feeds, Data Scraping, MySQL, and Linux seem essential here.

Now, putting it all together in JSON format with proper structure and ensuring all keys are enclosed in quotes.
