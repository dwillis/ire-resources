Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, the id is straightforward: CAR2012InvestigateNews as specified.

Next, for authors, Rob Oâ€™Dell is listed with Arizona Daily Star as his affiliation. Since there's no email provided, I'll leave it null.

The conference is clearly IRE. The year isn't explicitly mentioned, so I'll put "Not Listed".

For the title, "Investigating News with Data" captures the essence of using data in journalism.

The description should be a concise summary. Rob talks about using data to enhance breaking stories and provide insights, so I'll mention that.

Keywords are limited to five, excluding the conference and authors. From the text, relevant terms include data journalism, real estate, banks, foreclosures, tax liens, ArcGIS, and investigative reporting. I'll pick the top five most relevant ones.

I need to structure all these elements correctly in JSON format without making any mistakes.
