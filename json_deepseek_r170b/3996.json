Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has specified several keys that the JSON should have: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, let me extract each piece of information step by step. 

The id is straightforward; it's 3996 as provided.

Next, looking at the authors section. The tipsheet mentions a contact person: Robert Maguire, with email robert@crp.org and affiliation CRP (which I assume stands for Center for Responsive Politics). There are no other authors listed, so the authors array will have only one entry with name "Robert Maguire", email "robert@crp.org", and affiliation "CRP".

The conference is IRE since it's from Investigative Reporters and Editors.

I don't see a specific year mentioned in the text, so the year should be "Not Listed".

For the title, the tipsheet is titled "Top 5 Sources of Information on a 990", which makes sense as the main heading.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet explains how to use IRS Form 990 for nonprofit investigations, highlighting key sections and pages. So I'll phrase it as: "A guide to using IRS Form 990 filings for investigating nonprofits, highlighting key sections and information sources."

Now, the keywords. They should be no more than five terms related to the content but excluding the conference name. Looking at the tipsheet, relevant keywords could be "nonprofits", "IRS Form 990", "financial investigations", "lobbying activities", and "grant reporting". These cover the main topics without overlapping with the conference.

Putting it all together, I need to structure each part correctly in JSON format. Each key is enclosed in quotes, and string values are also in quotes. The authors array has objects with name, email, and affiliation. Since there's only one author, that's straightforward.

I should double-check if there are any other details I might have missed. The tipsheet doesn't mention the year of the conference, so "Not Listed" is correct for the year field. Also, all values need to be in English as per instructions, which they are.

Finally, ensuring proper syntax: commas separating the key-value pairs and brackets correctly enclosing arrays and objects.
