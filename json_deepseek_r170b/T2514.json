Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an IRE Annual Conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id should be "T2514" as specified. 

Next, looking at the authors: Jim Steele, Joe Stephens, and Mike McGraw. Their emails and affiliations are given. So each author object will have their name, email, and affiliation filled in accordingly. I'll make sure not to add any names that aren't there.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE Annual Conference", so the conference key will be "IRE". The year is also provided as 2005, so that's straightforward.

For the title, it's given as "Unsung Documents". 

The description needs to be a concise summary. I'll mention that the tipsheet highlights little-known documents and strategies for using them in investigative reporting.

Now, keywords. I should pick up to five relevant terms. Looking through the text, "investigative journalism", "FOIA", "document research", "government records", and "reporting techniques" seem appropriate. I'll exclude any that are too broad or not specific enough.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly quoted. Also, avoid making up any data; if something isn't there, leave it null or as per instructions.

Putting it all together, the JSON should accurately reflect each part of the tipsheet without adding extra information.
