Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the user has given specific instructions about what keys to include: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. They also mentioned that the id should be "4688_1". 

Looking at the content, the speaker is Andy Lehren from The New York Times, and the event is the NICAR Conference in Denver 2016. So, the conference key will be "NICAR" and the year is clearly listed as 2016.

Next, for the authors array, each entry should have name, email, and affiliation. Since only Andy Lehren's name is provided without an email, his email will be null. His affiliation is The New York Times, so that goes in there. No other authors are mentioned, so the array has one object.

The title of the session is "Humanizing Data". 

For the description, I need a concise 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet talks about using data to tell stories by relating to people through anecdotes and examples, so the description should capture that essence.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords would be "data journalism", "storytelling", "anecdotes", "investigative reporting". That makes four, which is within the limit.

I need to make sure all values are in English and properly quoted. Also, avoid making up any information, like emails or names that aren't provided.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each key accordingly. The authors array will have Andy Lehren with his details. The description succinctly summarizes the tipsheet's main point about using data to humanize stories through anecdotes and examples. Keywords are chosen based on the content without including the conference name or author names.
