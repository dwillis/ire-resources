Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has provided specific instructions for each key in the JSON.

First, I'll start by identifying the id as 3489 since that's clearly mentioned at the top of the document.

Next, looking at the authors section. The document lists "Loretta L. Auvil" from "UIUC". Since UIUC stands for University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, I can set her affiliation to that. There's no email provided, so it will be null.

The conference is CAR 2011, which falls under the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) events, so the conference key should be "IRE". The year is 2011 as stated in the document.

For the title, the tipsheet covers visualizing text with various tools like SEASR, Protovis, etc., so I'll name it "Visualizing Text".

The description needs to be a concise summary. It's about using different tools for data visualization and analysis, so I'll write something that encapsulates that.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, relevant terms include SEASR, Protovis, Meandre, text analysis, and data visualization.

I need to structure all these into a JSON object with proper formatting, ensuring all keys are in quotes and values are correctly placed.

```json
{
  "id": 3489,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2011,
  "title": "Visualizing Text",
  "description": "This tipsheet discusses various tools and techniques for visualizing text data, including SEASR, Protovis, and Meandre.",
  "keywords": [
    "SEASR",
    "Protovis",
    "Meandre",
    "text analysis",
    "data visualization"
  ]
}
```
