Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from Alicia Mundy's presentation at the IRE 2015 conference in Philadelphia. Let me break down what each part requires.

First, the structure should include id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is provided as 4546. 

For the authors section, it's a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. Since only Alicia Mundy is mentioned, her details will be included. Her email isn't provided, so that stays null. Affiliation isn't specified, but since she's presenting at IRE, which is Investigative Reporters and Editors, maybe that can be used as the affiliation.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, and the year is 2015. The title of the tipsheet is "Orphaned Drugs Stories." 

Next is the description, which needs to be a concise summary in simple language. From the slides, it seems the presentation focuses on the rising costs of orphaned drugs, their impact on Medicaid, state efforts to control these costs, and examples like Solvadi's pricing differences.

For keywords, I should pick up to five relevant terms. Orphaned Drugs, Drug Prices, Medicaid Costs, Pharmaceutical Industry, and State Policies seem appropriate.

I have to make sure all keys are in quotes and values too. Also, since the original language is English, everything stays in English. 

Putting it all together, the JSON structure should look clean with each key properly assigned.
