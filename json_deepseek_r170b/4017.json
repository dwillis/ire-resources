Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Michael J. Berens of The Seattle Times. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the ID is given as 4017. So that's straightforward.

Next, for authors, it lists Michael J. Berens with his email and affiliation to The Seattle Times. I'll structure this as an array with one object containing name, email, and affiliation.

Conference isn't explicitly mentioned, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed". Similarly, the year is also not provided, so that's "Not Listed" too.

The title should be concise. Looking at the content, it's about source classification for journalists, so "Source Types for Journalists: Strategies and Risks" fits well.

For the description, I need a 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet categorizes sources into types with strategies and risks, helping reporters build relationships. That's clear and concise.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference and authors. The main topics are source classification, interviewing strategies, journalist-source relationships, media ethics, and investigative reporting.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring each key is correctly filled with the appropriate values.
