Alright, I'm looking at this query where the user provided some tipsheet content from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. They want me to create a specific JSON object with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, I need to parse through the given text carefully. The title is "Beyond Raids and Rallies: Covering Immigration by Covering Your Community" and it's presented at an IRE event in Orlando. So, the conference key should be "IRE".

Looking for authors, the main speaker is Paul Overberg from The Wall Street Journal. His email is poverberg2@gmail.com and his Twitter handle is @poverberg. Since he's affiliated with WSJ, that goes into his affiliation.

The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the provided text, so I'll set it to "Not Listed".

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet focuses on using data sources like ACS and TRAC for community-level immigration reporting. So, something about practical ways to cover migration with local data makes sense.

Keywords should be relevant and no more than five. Immigration, data journalism, American Community Survey (ACS), Migration Policy Institute (MPI), and TRAC Immigration seem appropriate here.

I also need to structure the JSON correctly with all required keys, ensuring that authors are in a list format with their details. Since there's only one author mentioned, the list has one object.

Finally, making sure everything is properly enclosed in quotes and follows the correct syntax so that the JSON is valid.
