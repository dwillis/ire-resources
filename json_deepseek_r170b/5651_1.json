Okay, so I'm trying to help create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The user provided specific instructions on what each key should contain, like id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. 

First, I need to parse the input data they gave. It starts with "IRE 2018 – Tracking dark money in the midterm elections" and includes a speaker named Andrew Perez from MapLight. There are various resources listed under categories like 990s, Ways to find nonprofits’ receipts and grants, Company disclosures, State business records, Dark money spending, and Open records requests.

The user wants each JSON key filled out with specific information. The id should be "5651_1", which is straightforward. For authors, it's a list where each element has name, email, and affiliation. Andrew Perez is listed with his email and affiliation as MapLight. Since there are no other authors mentioned, the list only includes him.

The conference is clearly IRE, and the year is 2018 as given in the title. The title itself is "Tracking dark money in the midterm elections." 

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary of one or two sentences explaining what the tipsheet covers. Looking at the resources provided, it's about various methods to track nonprofit financials, corporate disclosures, and political spending. So I can craft a sentence that captures these elements without getting too detailed.

For keywords, they should be no more than five terms excluding the conference and authors. Relevant terms here could be "dark money," "nonprofits," "political spending," "corporate disclosures," and "FEC filings." These cover the main topics discussed in the tipsheet.

I need to ensure that all keys are properly quoted and that the JSON structure is valid. Also, I must avoid making up any information; if it's not provided, like other authors, they should be null or omitted.

Double-checking each part: id is set correctly, authors list only has Andrew with his details, conference and year match the input, title is accurate, description is concise, keywords are relevant and limited to five. 

I think that covers all the requirements. Now I can structure this into a proper JSON object as per the user's specifications.
