Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on this tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided a detailed example, which I can use as a guide.

First, the id is given as 4771, straightforward. Next, the authors section requires each author's name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the document, there are several presenters:

- Jordan Wirfs-Brock (@jordanwb)
- Dan Boyce (@boycedan)
- Stephanie Joyce (@stephaniemjoyce)
- Leigh Paterson (@sclaterpee)
- Rebecca Jacobson (@rebeccajacobson)

But wait, the affiliations aren't explicitly mentioned. The example used "Inside Energy" as the affiliation because that's the organization they're associated with. So I'll do the same for each author.

The conference is listed as CAR 2016 in Denver. Since CAR stands for Computer-Assisted Reporting and is part of IRE, the conference field should be "IRE". The year is clearly 2016. 

For the title, it's "24 Energy Story Ideas You Can Do Right Now", which is the main heading.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet provides various story ideas related to energy topics with data sources and resources. So I can write something like: "This tipsheet offers 24 story ideas for investigating energy-related topics, each with data sources and reporting resources."

Keywords should capture the essence without including the conference or authors. From the content, relevant keywords would be "energy", "story ideas", "data journalism", "investigative reporting", and "reporting resources".

Putting it all together, I structure the JSON accordingly. Each author entry in the list includes their name, email (from Twitter handles), and affiliation as Inside Energy.

I should make sure that all keys are enclosed in quotes and that the JSON is properly formatted without any markdown.
