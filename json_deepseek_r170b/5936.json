Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an IRE tipsheet. First, I'll identify each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The ID is given as 5936. Next, for the authors, I see four names with emails and affiliations. Blake Ellis is from CNN, Melanie Hicken also from CNN, Kristin Hussey has a Gmail, so no affiliation listed there, and Topher Sanders is from ProPublica. I'll structure each author as an object with name, email, and affiliation.

Conference is clearly stated as "IRE". The year isn't explicitly mentioned, so I'll set it to "Not Listed". The title is provided in the input: "Tips for Investigative Journalists: Researching People, Businesses, and Government Data".

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet covers methods like deep Google searches, document tools, and government data access. I'll phrase that into 1-2 sentences.

Keywords should be up to five relevant terms. From the content, "investigative journalism", "government data", "document research", "data analysis", and "research techniques" fit well.

Now, I'll structure all these elements into a JSON object, ensuring correct syntax with proper quotation marks and commas.

    {
      "name": null,

    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Tips for Investigative Journalists: Researching People, Businesses, and Government Data",
  "description": "This tipsheet provides practical advice and resources for investigative journalists on how to research people, businesses, and government data effectively.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative journalism",
    "government data",
    "document research",
    "data analysis",
    "research techniques"
  ]
