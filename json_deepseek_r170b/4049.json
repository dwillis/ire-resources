Alright, I'm trying to create this JSON object based on the user's query. Let me first parse what they're asking for.

So, the user provided some notes from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet titled "Criminal Norway." They want a JSON response with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 4049.

Looking at the content, I see mentions of VG, which is a Norwegian news organization. There's an author named John Bones with his contact info. Since the text doesn't mention other authors, I'll list him alone in the authors array. His email and affiliation are provided, so that's straightforward.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE" since it's from their tipsheet. The year isn't explicitly mentioned anywhere in the notes, so I'll default to "Not Listed."

For the title, it's given as "Criminal Norway." The description needs to be a concise summary of the text. From the content, they're using data analysis and interactive tools for criminal reporting, so I can summarize that into one or two sentences.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking at the notes, relevant keywords are FOIA requests, criminal data, police response times, regional disparities, and interactive journalism.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part accordingly, making sure all keys are in quotes and values follow the specified format.
