Alright, so I need to create a JSON object from the given input. The user has provided a detailed tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. My task is to parse this information correctly.

First, I'll identify the key sections: authors, conference details, title, description, keywords, and contact info. The id should be 5603 as specified. 

Looking at the authors, Dave Umhoefer from Marquette University and Eric Litke from Milwaukee Journal Sentinel are listed with their emails and affiliations. So I'll structure each author with name, email, and affiliation.

The conference is clearly labeled as "IRE", so that's straightforward. The year isn't mentioned in the input, so it will be "Not Listed". 

For the title, "Watchdogging Local Government" seems appropriate. The description needs to summarize the tipsheet briefly, focusing on strategies for accountability journalism, tracking government actions, and using public records.

Keywords should include terms like "accountability journalism", "local government", "public records", "financial documents", and "investigative reporting". I'll make sure not to exceed five keywords.

I also notice contact information at the end, but since it's part of the authors' details, I'll include emails and affiliations there. 

Double-checking all fields: id is correct, authors are properly listed with their info, conference is set, year is handled, title and description are concise, and keywords are relevant and within limit.

I think that covers everything required by the user's query.
