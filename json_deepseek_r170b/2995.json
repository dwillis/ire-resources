Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about the farmsubsidy.org project. The user provided specific instructions on what keys to include: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, I'll start with the id, which is given as 2995. That's straightforward.

Next, the authors section requires a list of objects each containing name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the text, there are two authors mentioned: Brigitte Alfter and Nils Mulvad. Their emails and affiliations are provided. I'll make sure to structure each author correctly with their details.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE since the project won an IRE Freedom of Information award in 2006. So, the conference key will be "IRE".

For the year, it's mentioned that the award was given in 2006, so I'll set the year to 2006.

The title should reflect the project's name and purpose. The original text mentions it as "FarmSubsidy.org: Uncovering EU Agricultural Payments," which seems appropriate.

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary of the project. It should mention that it's about transparency in EU farm subsidies, the amount involved, and its impact. I'll make sure it's 1-2 sentences and simple.

Keywords are next. They should exclude the conference and authors but include relevant terms from the project. Words like "transparency," "subsidies," "EU," "agricultural policy," and "freedom of information" fit well and are within the five-term limit.

I need to ensure that all keys and values are in English and enclosed in quotes. Since the original text is in English, no translation issues here.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part carefully, double-checking for any missing or incorrect data. That should cover everything the user asked for.
