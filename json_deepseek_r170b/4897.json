Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. The input provided seems to be from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet about online resources for journalists. 

First, I'll start by identifying each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

The id is given as 4897. That's straightforward.

Next, the authors section. The input mentions Jaimi Dowdell as the author. However, thereâ€™s no email or affiliation provided. So, I'll set name to "Jaimi Dowdell" and both email and affiliation to null.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE since it's from Investigative Reporters and Editors. The year is listed as 2016 in the updated date, so that goes into the year field.

For the title, I'll use the main heading which seems to be about online resources for journalists, so "Online Resources for Journalists" makes sense.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers various search techniques and alternative engines, so I'll phrase it as a 1-2 sentence overview of those topics.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking through the content, relevant keywords are "search techniques", "online resources", "investigative journalism", "public records", and "social media searches".

Putting it all together, I structure each key with appropriate values, ensuring everything is in English and properly enclosed in quotes.
