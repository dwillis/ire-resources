Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. Let me read through their instructions carefully.

First, they want the response to be only a JSON object describing a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The input provided includes details about a session titled "DOING A MAJOR BUSINESS INVESTIGATION" at the IRE Atlanta Conference in June 2004 by Jenni Bergal.

I should structure this into specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. 

The ID is given as T2122. For authors, it's a list of elements with name, email, and affiliation. The author here is Jenni Bergal from the Sun-Sentinel, so I can fill those in.

Conference is clearly "IRE" since it's an IRE conference. Year is 2004, as mentioned. The title is straightforward: "Doing a Major Business Investigation."

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet discusses how to investigate business scams and frauds by checking various records like court filings, SEC, FTC, etc. So, I can write that in one or two sentences.

Keywords should include terms related to the topic without including conference or authors. Scams, fraud, investigation techniques fit well here.

I'll make sure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. No markdown or extra textâ€”just the JSON object as requested.
