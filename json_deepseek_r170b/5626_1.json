Okay, so I need to create a JSON object from the given input based on specific instructions. Let me start by understanding what each key requires.

First, the id should be "5626_1". Got it.

Next, authors is a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. The user mentioned not to make up names, so if there's no author listed, leave name as null. Looking at the input, I see Jill Riepenhoff is listed at the end with her email and affiliation as Raycom Media. So the authors array will have one object with her details.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE 2018" in Orlando, Fla. So conference should be "IRE", year is 2018.

Title of the tipsheet is given as "Consumer Investigations: Stories that Make a Difference".

For the description, it needs to be a concise summary. The input lists various sources like CFPB, FTC, etc., so I'll mention how these resources help journalists find consumer-related stories.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the text, keywords could be "consumer investigations", "CFPB", "FTC", "data journalism", "public records". That's five.

Putting it all together, I structure each key with appropriate values, ensuring strings are in quotes and proper formatting.
