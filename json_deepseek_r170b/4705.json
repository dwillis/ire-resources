Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet titled "Getting your feet wet: Data projects you can try anywhere." The user provided specific instructions, so let me go through each step carefully.

First, I notice that the ID should be 4705. Thatâ€™s straightforward. Next, looking at the authors, they are listed as @TVNewsJamie and @kcrowebasspro. Since there are no full names or emails provided in the text, I'll set their names to null. The affiliation for both is the news organization mentioned, which seems to be TVNews and another unspecified one, so I'll use "TVNews" for Jamie and leave the other as null.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that goes into the conference field. The year isn't provided in the text, so it should default to "Not Listed." 

For the title, it's given directly: "Getting your feet wet: Data projects you can try anywhere." The description needs to be a concise summary. Looking at the content, the tipsheet covers various data-driven story ideas like potholes, tax delinquents, payroll data, etc., so I'll craft a 1-2 sentence summary that captures this essence.

Keywords are next. They should be no more than five and exclude the conference and authors. From the topics covered, I can extract: "infrastructure," "tax delinquents," "payroll data," "data journalism," and "investigative reporting."

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with each key as specified. Making sure that strings are in quotes and proper formatting is maintained to avoid errors.
