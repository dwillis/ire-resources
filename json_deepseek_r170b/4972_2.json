Okay, so I've got this user query that I need to process. Let's see what they're asking for.

They provided a detailed set of slides from a presentation about user testing in journalism. The main points covered are the importance of user testing, how it can be applied beyond just design (like audio projects or story comprehension), some examples of news organizations using it, and resources for further reading. The presenters are Hannah Birch from ProPublica and Clarisa Diaz from WNYC.

Now, the task is to create a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id should be 4972_2. Authors need to be a list with each having name, email, and affiliation. The emails are provided in the contact info at the end of the slides. Affiliation is clear from their current roles.

The conference isn't explicitly mentioned here, but considering the content is about journalism and user testing, it's likely for an event like NICAR (which focuses on investigative reporting and data journalism). If I can't be sure, maybe it's better to put "Not Listed", but since ProPublica often presents at NICAR, I'll go with that.

Year isn't given directly in the text. The slides have a 2016 copyright notice for WNYC, so maybe the conference was around that time. But without an exact year, perhaps it's safer to mark it as "Not Listed".

The title is pretty clear from the opening slide: "User Testing 101: Why Journalists Should Talk to Their Audience". The description needs to be a concise summary of what user testing is and its relevance in journalism.

For keywords, I'll pick relevant terms like "user testing", "journalism", "usability", "audience research", "design".

I should structure the JSON accordingly. Make sure all values are in English and properly quoted. Also, ensure that if any information isn't available, it's set to null or "Not Listed" as per instructions.

Wait, I need to make sure authors have their correct affiliations based on the presentation. Hannah is from ProPublica, Clarisa from WNYC. Emails are provided at the end, so include those.

Double-checking that the JSON structure has all required keys and that each author entry includes name, email, and affiliation. Also, confirm that keywords don't exceed five terms and exclude conference names or authors.

Alright, I think that covers everything. Time to put it all together into the JSON object.
