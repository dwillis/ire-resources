Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, identify the id. The user specified it should be 5563, so that's straightforward.

Next are the authors. There's only one author mentioned: Todd Wallack from the Boston Globe. His email is provided as twallack@globe.com, and his affiliation is clearly the Boston Globe. So the authors list will have one object with name, email, and affiliation filled in.

The conference is IRE Boston, so the conference key should be "IRE". The year is given as 10/20/2018, which I'll format as 2018.

For the title, it's "Public records tips".

Now the description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers how to effectively request public records, including preparation, specific phrasing, and follow-up actions. So I'll summarize that into one or two sentences.

Keywords should be up to five relevant terms. Looking at the content, "public records", "FOIA", "request process", "investigative journalism" make sense. That's four, so maybe add another like "transparency".

Putting it all together, each key is filled as per instructions, ensuring correct data types and formatting.
