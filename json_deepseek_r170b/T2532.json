Okay, I need to create a JSON object from the given tipsheet. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id is specified as T2532, so that's straightforward.

Looking at the authors section, there's information about David Schechter. His name is provided, along with his email and affiliation from WCCO-TV. So I'll create an author object with these details. There are no other authors mentioned, so the list will have just one entry.

The conference is listed as "IRE: DEN VE R" which I think stands for Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) in Denver, 2004. So the conference key should be "IRE".

For the year, it's clearly stated as 6/2/2004, so I'll use 2004.

The title of the tipsheet is given as "GAMBLING & CASINO PROBES: 'MEMBERSHIP DISPUTES'". I need to make sure that's accurately captured.

In the description, it should be a concise summary. The main points are about membership disputes in tribes related to per capita payments and regulatory issues with tribal gaming. So I'll phrase it as "Explores membership disputes in Native American tribes related to casino revenue distribution and regulatory challenges in Indian gaming."

For keywords, I need up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. The relevant terms from the text are: "gambling", "casino probes", "membership disputes", "tribal regulation", and "Indian gaming". That makes five, so that's covered.

I also need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. I think I've got everything now.
