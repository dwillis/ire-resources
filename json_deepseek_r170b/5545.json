Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let's break this down step by step.

First, looking at the input provided, it's about a session titled "Prying Loose Public Records" with speakers Andrew Chavez, Paul C. Watler, and Eric D. Wong. The conference is the IRE Watchdog Workshop held in 2018. 

The title of the tipsheet is "Prying Loose Public Records." The description should be a concise summary. From the content, it seems to cover the Texas Public Information Act (TPIA), its basics, exceptions, and case studies like "Pain & Profit." So I'll need to craft that into 1-2 sentences.

Next, for the authors, each speaker is listed with their name. However, only Paul C. Watler has an email provided (pwatler@jw.com) and his affiliation is Jackson Walker (JW). Andrew Chavez's affiliation isn't explicitly mentioned, so I'll leave it as null. Same with Eric D. Wong; no email or affiliation is given.

The keywords should be relevant and up to five terms. The main topics are Texas Public Information Act, public records, transparency, government accountability, and "Pain & Profit." These seem appropriate.

I also need to ensure all keys like id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords are present with correct values. Conference is IRE since it's an IRE Watchdog Workshop. Year is 2018 as given in the header.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part accordingly, making sure emails and affiliations are correctly placed under each author object.
