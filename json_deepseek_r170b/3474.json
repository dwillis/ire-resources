Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to create this JSON object based on the user's query. They provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference and specific instructions on what keys to include.

First, I need to parse the input data. The title of the session is "PRODUCING THE CAR STORY: techniques and alternatives to print," which took place at the 2011 IRE CAR Conference in Raleigh, NC. The year is clearly mentioned as 2011, so that's straightforward.

Next, the authors section requires a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. Looking through the text, Stuart Watson is listed as the speaker from WCNC-TV, Charlotte, NC, with an email provided. There are other names mentioned like Don Hewitt, David Raziq, Kellie Cheadle, Bob Segall, and Al Tompkins, but their affiliations aren't explicitly tied to their names beyond what's in the quotes. According to the instructions, if the affiliation isn't listed next to the author's name, I should use the news organization mentioned elsewhere as their affiliation.

So for Stuart Watson, it's clear: name is "Stuart Watson," email is "stuart.investigates@gmail.com," and affiliation is "WCNC-TV, Charlotte, NC." For the others like Don Hewitt, since he's from CBS 60 Minutes, I can infer his affiliation as such. Similarly, David Raziq is with KHOU Houston, Kellie Cheadle with KING 5 Seattle, Bob Segall with WTHR Indianapolis, and Al Tompkins with Poynter Institute.

The description needs to be a concise summary in simple language. The tipsheet focuses on storytelling techniques in CAR stories using emotion effectively and keeping it clear. I'll make sure the description captures that essence without being too wordy.

For keywords, I need up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, "storytelling," "CAR reporting," "investigative journalism," "television journalism," and "data journalism" seem relevant.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with id 3474, set conference to "IRE" since it's clearly an IRE event, and ensure all fields are correctly populated. I have to make sure that emails and affiliations are accurately captured for each author without making up any information.
