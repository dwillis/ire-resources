Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given input about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet regarding military investigations. The user has specified certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, I'll set the id as 4580 since that's provided. Next, for the authors, there are two people mentioned: Eva Parks and an unnamed person from The Dallas Morning News. Since only Eva's details are given, I'll include her name, email, and affiliation with KXAS-TV/NBC. The second author doesn't have a name listed, so their name will be null, and since they're part of the partnership, their affiliation is The Dallas Morning News.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE". The year isn't provided in the input, so I'll set it to "Not Listed".

For the title, the tipsheet is titled "MILITARY INVESTIGATION" based on the content. The description should be a concise summary of the topic, focusing on how to obtain military records and conduct investigations effectively.

Keywords need to be up to five relevant terms. I'll include "military investigation", "FOIA requests", "journalism", "government transparency", and "investigative reporting" as they capture the essence of the tipsheet.

I must ensure all values are in English, keys are enclosed in quotes, and the structure follows proper JSON formatting without markdown.
