Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from NICAR 2016. The user provided specific instructions with keys like id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, the id is straightforward—4679 as specified. Next, looking at the authors section. Alexandra Kanik is mentioned and her Twitter handle @act_rational is given, but there's no email listed. The affiliations are publicsource.org and metricshift.org, so I'll include those for each author entry.

The conference is NICAR 2016 in Denver on Friday, March 11, so the conference key should be "NICAR" and the year is 2016. The title of the session seems to be about information design for the human brain, so that's clear.

For the description, it needs a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about cognitive load and using visuals like GIFs effectively. I'll phrase that into one or two simple sentences.

Keywords are next—up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking at the content, "information design," "cognitive load," "visual storytelling," "animated GIFs," and "spatial visualization" fit well as they capture the main topics discussed.

I should ensure all values are in English and properly quoted. Also, make sure that the structure aligns with JSON syntax without any markdown or additional formatting.
