Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with certain keys like id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, I'll start by identifying each required key and figure out what data goes into them. 

The id should be "QUERY_STORIES" as per the example. Next, looking at the presenters section, there are three people: Kate Martin, Grant Smith, and Megan Luther. Each of their names is followed by a Twitter handle and affiliation. I need to extract each presenter's name, email (if provided), and affiliation. 

For Kate Martin, her affiliation is Skagit Valley Herald, so that's straightforward. Grant Smith is affiliated with The Commercial Appeal in Memphis. Megan Luther is listed as the training director for IRE, so her affiliation is IRE. None of them have emails provided, so those fields will be null.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that key is set. The year isn't mentioned anywhere in the document, so it should default to "Not Listed".

For the title, looking at the content, it's about using Excel and data analysis for journalism, so a suitable title would be something like "Excel Tips and Data Analysis for Journalists". 

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers various Excel techniques and data sources journalists can use, so I'll phrase that into a couple of sentences.

Keywords should include terms related to the content but exclude proper nouns like conference names or authors. Relevant keywords from the material are "Excel", "data analysis", "journalism tools", "pivot tables", and "investigative reporting".

Putting it all together, I need to structure this information into a JSON object with appropriate keys and ensure that each value is correctly formatted, especially handling nulls where necessary.
