Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let's break down each step carefully.

First, the user specified that the id should be 5709. That part is straightforward.

Next, the authors section needs to be a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. The tipsheet mentions Maria Carrillo as the speaker from the Tampa Bay Times. Since there are no other authors listed, I'll create one object for her. Her email isn't provided, so it will be null, and her affiliation is clearly the Tampa Bay Times.

For the conference field, since this is from an IRE event, the value should be "IRE".

The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the text, so according to instructions, it should default to "Not Listed".

The title of the tipsheet is "Writing the Investigative Narrative", which is clearly stated at the top.

Now, the description needs to be a concise 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet covers how to structure and write effective investigative stories, focusing on elements like narrative techniques, reporting strategies, and editing tips. So, I'll craft a simple sentence that captures this essence.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords include "investigative journalism", "narrative writing", "story structure", "reporting techniques", and "editing tips". These are all central themes in the provided material.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with these elements, ensuring that each key is enclosed in quotes and the syntax is correct.

```json
{
  "id": 5709,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Maria Carrillo",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Tampa Bay Times"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Writing the Investigative Narrative",
  "description": "A tipsheet on crafting compelling investigative stories, covering narrative structure, reporting techniques, and editing strategies.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative journalism",
    "narrative writing",
    "story structure",
    "reporting techniques",
    "editing tips"
  ]
}
```
