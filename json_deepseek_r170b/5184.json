Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tip sheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has specified certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, the id is given as 5184, so that's straightforward. 

Next, looking at the speakers listed: Nuran Alteir, Dianna Nañez, and Imraan Siddiqi. The user wants each author to have name, email, and affiliation. Since emails aren't provided, they'll be null. Affiliations are clear from their titles—Nuran is a freelance reporter with AAJA, Dianna is at Arizona Republic, and Imraan is with CAIR-Arizona.

The conference is IRE, as it's an IRE tip sheet. The year isn't mentioned anywhere in the text, so I'll set that to "Not Listed".

For the title, the tip sheet is named “Covering Muslim America”. 

The description needs a concise summary. It's about providing resources and tips for journalists reporting on Muslim communities in the US, covering cultural context and diverse sources.

Keywords should be relevant terms: "Muslim America", "Journalism", "Diversity", "Religion", "Media".

I need to make sure all values are in English, enclosed in quotes, and that the JSON structure is correct. No markdown, just a plain JSON object.
