Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has provided specific instructions on how to structure this JSON.

First, looking at the input, it's titled "CRAFTING THE INVESTIGATIVE NARRATIVE" and was presented by James Neff from The Seattle Times. His contact info is also there. So I know the title and author details.

The id should be T1871 as per the user's example. Under authors, since only James Neff is mentioned, his name will go in the list with his email and affiliation as The Seattle Times.

Conference is definitely IRE because it's their national conference. Year is 2003, clearly stated. Title is straightforward from the heading.

For description, I need a concise summary of the tipsheet. It covers rules and tips for writing investigative narratives, so I'll mention that and include elements like plot, character development, and structure.

Keywords should be relevant terms without including conference or author names. From the content, "investigative narrative," "storytelling techniques," "plot development," "character development," and "journalistic writing" seem appropriate.

I have to make sure all keys are in quotes and the structure follows the example exactly. I'll double-check each field to ensure accuracy.
