Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to create this JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors conference. The user provided specific instructions, so I need to make sure I follow them closely.

First, they want a JSON object with keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is 2676, straightforward. 

Next, the authors section needs to be a list of objects each containing name, email, and affiliation. The user mentioned not to make up any names and leave null if none are listed. They also said that if a news organization is mentioned, use that as the affiliation.

Looking at the input, I see four authors: MaryJo Webster, Tisha Thompson, Brent Jones, Matt Wynn. Each has an email and Twitter handle. For example, MaryJo's email is maryjo.webster@startribune.com, so her affiliation should be @MaryJoWebster as listed, but wait, no, the instruction says if a news organization is mentioned, use that. So for MaryJo, since she's affiliated with startribune, I should set her affiliation to "Star Tribune". Similarly, Tisha Thompson is at NBCUniversal, Brent Jones at St. Louis Public Radio, and Matt Wynn at Omaha World-Herald.

Now, the conference is NICAR16, which falls under the NICAR category. The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the input, so I'll set it to "Not Listed".

The title should be "How to avoid rookie mistakes" as given. For the description, a 1-2 sentence summary: It provides tips on data handling, cleaning, and analysis to prevent common errors.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords could be "data", "cleaning", "analysis", "journalism", "best practices".

I also need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Let me structure this accordingly.
