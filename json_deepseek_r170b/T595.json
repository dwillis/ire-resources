Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. The input provided includes details from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, I'll extract the id as "T595" since it's specified. Next, the authors section requires a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. The author mentioned is Margo Smit from KRO "Reporter," so her details will be included. Her email is provided, and since she works for KRO, that's her affiliation.

The conference is listed as the 2003 Global Investigative Journalism Conference in Copenhagen. I'll check if this is an IRE event. Yes, it seems to be part of their conferences, so the conference key will be "IRE". The year is clearly 2003, so that goes into the year field.

For the title, it's given as 'Dealing with Big Brothers – investigating Endemol'. The description needs a concise summary. I'll read through the tips and case history to craft a simple 1-2 sentence summary focusing on media empires and investigative techniques.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords are "media empires", "investigative journalism", "Endemol", "financial investigation", and "legal challenges".

I'll structure all these elements into a JSON object with proper formatting, ensuring all keys and values are in English and enclosed in quotes.
