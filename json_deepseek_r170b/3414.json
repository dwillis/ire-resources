Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the tipsheet provided. Let's break down what needs to be done step by step.

First, the id should be 3414 as given. The authors section is a list, and each author should have name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the input, Alison Young is listed with her email and affiliation as USA TODAY. So I'll add her with those details.

Next, the conference needs to be determined. Since the tipsheet mentions it's from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference, the conference key will be "IRE". The year isn't specified in the input, so I'll set it to "Not Listed".

For the title, the tipsheet is titled "Documents for Public Health Investigations," which I can use directly. The description should be a brief summary of the content. It's about public health documents like vaccination audits and disease databases, so I'll phrase that into one or two sentences.

Keywords are next. They need to be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking through the tipsheet, relevant keywords would be "public health," "vaccination compliance," "immunization records," "disease reporting," and "FDA warnings." That makes five, so that's covered.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part accordingly, ensuring all keys are in quotes and proper formatting is maintained. I think that covers everything needed for the JSON object.
