Alright, I need to help the user by creating a JSON object based on their query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The user provided specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, I'll start by identifying each part of the input text. The id is given as T1924, so that's straightforward. Next, looking for the author information. The law firm Holland & Knight LLP is mentioned, and Charles D. Tobin is listed with his contact details. So, his name will be "Charles D. Tobin", email is provided, and affiliation is "Holland & Knight LLP".

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's set. The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the text, so it should default to "Not Listed". 

For the title, the main heading in the input is about promises being contracts, which becomes the title: "A Promise Is Not Just A Promise – It May Be A Contract As Well".

The description needs a concise summary. The tipsheet discusses legal implications of promising anonymity to sources and provides examples where such promises can be enforceable. So, I'll phrase it as a 1-2 sentence overview.

Keywords are next. They should be relevant terms from the content. "Confidential sources", "anonymity", "journalism law", "contracts", and "First Amendment" seem appropriate.

I need to make sure all keys and values are in quotes, no markdown is used, and everything's in English as per instructions. Also, since the year isn't specified, it remains "Not Listed".

Now, putting it all together into a JSON structure without any additional formatting or explanation.
