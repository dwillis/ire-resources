Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors conference. The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, the id is T1775. That's straightforward. Next, authors. There's only one author mentioned: David Charles Donald. His email is provided as ddonald@savannahnow.com, and his affiliation is the Savannah Morning News. So I'll structure that under authors with those details.

The conference is clearly stated as NICAR since it's from the 2003 NICAR Conference in Charlotte, N.C. The year is 2003 because it's mentioned right there. 

For the title, the main heading is "10 Dos for Building CAR..." so I'll use that exact phrase to stay accurate.

The description needs to be a concise summary. Looking at the content, it's about strategies for implementing CAR in smaller newsrooms, so I'll write something like: "Tips and strategies for effectively implementing computer-assisted reporting (CAR) in small to mid-sized newsrooms."

Keywords should capture the essence without including the conference or author names. So terms like "computer-assisted reporting", "CAR", "small newsrooms", "journalism techniques", and "data analysis" fit well.

I'll make sure all values are enclosed in quotes, as per JSON standards, and that no keys or values are missed. Let me double-check each part to ensure accuracy before finalizing the JSON.
