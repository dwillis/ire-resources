Alright, I'm looking at this query where the user wants me to create a JSON object based on a tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors conferences. They provided specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, the id is given as 3298, so that's straightforward. Next, authors need to be a list with elements containing name, email, and affiliation. The text mentions Chuck Goudie as the investigative reporter from ABC7 Chicago. Since there are no other names listed, I'll only include him. His email isn't provided, so it remains null.

The conference is clearly stated as part of Investigative Reporters and Editors, so the conference key will be "IRE". The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the text, so I'll default to "Not Listed".

For the title, it's given as "Staying On the Air, Staying Relevant aka Becoming Indispensible", which I need to include exactly. The description should summarize the tipsheet in 1-2 sentences. It focuses on helping journalists maintain relevance through regular segments and exclusive reporting.

Keywords are next. I'll pick relevant terms like investigative journalism, media strategies, exclusive reporting, staying relevant, and content leadership, ensuring they're no more than five and exclude the conference name and authors' names.

Putting it all together, I structure each key according to the instructions, making sure everything is in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Double-checking that all fields meet the user's specifications before finalizing the JSON.
