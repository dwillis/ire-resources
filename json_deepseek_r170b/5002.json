Alright, I'm trying to help the user create a JSON object based on their query. The input provided seems to be from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet about using Google Earth Engine for analyzing satellite imagery. 

First, I need to parse through the content carefully. The title of the session is "Analyzing satellite imagery with Google Earth Engine." There are two presenters mentioned: Eric Sagara from Reveal and Chris Herwig from Google.

The description should be a concise summary. Looking at the content, it covers using satellite data for storytelling, different bands captured by satellites, techniques like NDVI, and hands-on coding with Earth Engine's API. So I'll summarize that into 1-2 sentences focusing on the application of satellite imagery in journalism.

Next, the keywords should be relevant but exclude the conference name and authors. Terms like "satellite imagery," "Google Earth Engine," "remote sensing," "data visualization," and "investigative reporting" seem appropriate as they capture the essence without being too broad or specific.

For the authors section, I need to list each presenter with their details. Eric Sagara is affiliated with Reveal, so his affiliation is clear. Chris Herwig is from Google, which is straightforward. Both emails are null since they aren't provided in the text.

The conference is clearly an IRE event, and although the year isn't explicitly mentioned, it's safer to mark it as "Not Listed" unless there's a specific year provided, which doesn't seem to be the case here.

Putting it all together, each part of the JSON should align with the user's instructions. Ensuring that all keys are enclosed in quotes and the structure is correct is crucial. I'll double-check to make sure no made-up data is included and everything accurately reflects the provided text.
