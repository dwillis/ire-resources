Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, they provided details from a session titled "Demystifying the command line: Basic guide" by Alex Richards at the 2015 IRE Conference. The content includes various terminal commands with explanations.

The user wants a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. 

I should start by assigning the id as 4560. For authors, it's a list where each entry has name, email, and affiliation. Since only Alex Richards is mentioned without an email or affiliation, I'll set those to null.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, and the year is 2015. The title is given as "Demystifying the command line: Basic guide". 

Next, the description needs a concise summary. The session introduces basic terminal commands for navigation, file management, etc., so I'll phrase that simply.

Keywords should be relevant terms excluding conference and authors. I'll include command line, Terminal, OS X, shell commands, and file management as they are central to the content.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly quoted without any markdown. Let me structure this correctly.

```json
{
  "id": 4560,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Alex Richards",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "IRE/NICAR"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2015,
  "title": "Demystifying the command line: Basic guide",
  "description": "A basic guide to navigating and using the OS X Terminal, including commands for directory navigation, file management, and more.",
  "keywords": [
    "command line",
    "Terminal",
    "OS X",
    "shell commands",
    "file management"
  ]
}
```
