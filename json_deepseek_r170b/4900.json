Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an IRE conference. Let me break down what's required.

First, looking at the input, the speaker is T. Christian Miller from ProPublica. His email isn't provided, so that will be null. The affiliation is clearly ProPublica since it's mentioned multiple times.

The conference is IRE 2016, so the year is 2016 and the conference key should be "IRE".

The title of the presentation is "The Digital FOIA" or alternatively "Or How to Make Big Data Big Easy". Since the main title seems to be "The Digital FOIA", I'll go with that.

For the description, it's a tipsheet on obtaining digital data through FOIA. I need to summarize this in 1-2 sentences simply. So something like how to efficiently get digital data from government sources using negotiation and alternative methods.

Keywords should include up to five terms. From the content, relevant keywords are "FOIA", "digital data", "data acquisition", "negotiation", and "government transparency". These capture the essence without including conference or author names.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each key appropriately, ensuring that all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes.
