Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The user provided specific instructions on how to structure the JSON with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, looking at the content, it's titled "STRATEGY, SHOOTING, AND SURVIVAL FOR NON-BROADCAST REPORTER." This seems to be a tipsheet aimed at non-broadcast journalists, providing them with strategies for creating effective video content. 

Next, I need to identify the authors. The document mentions Paige Schwahn from Gannett as the presenter. Her email and phone number are provided, so I can include those in her author details.

The conference is clearly linked to IRE since it's an IRE event, so the "conference" key will be "IRE". However, the year isn't explicitly stated in the document, so I'll set that to "Not Listed".

For the description, I should summarize the main points. The tipsheet covers video production for non-broadcast reporters, including equipment checks, filming techniques, and social media strategies. So a concise summary would mention these elements.

Keywords need to be relevant and limited to five. Looking at the content, terms like "video production", "non-broadcast reporting", "filming techniques", "social media", and "journalism training" are appropriate.

I should structure all of this into the specified JSON format, ensuring each key is correctly named and values are properly enclosed in quotes.
