Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id is provided as 4567, so that's straightforward. Next, looking at the authors section. The speaker mentioned is Russell Gold. His email is russell.gold@wsj.com and his affiliation is the Wall Street Journal. So I'll list him with these details.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, held in 2015. The title of the presentation is "Oil on the Tracks." For the description, I need a concise summary. From the content, it's about how Bakken Shale oil's volatility leads to rail explosions, so that's a good one-sentence summary.

Keywords should be relevant and limited to five. The main points are "crude oil," "rail transport," "Bakken Shale," "oil safety," and "energy reporting." These capture the essence without including conference or author names.

I think that covers all the necessary parts. Now, I'll structure this into a JSON object with the specified keys.
