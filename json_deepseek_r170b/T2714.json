Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a tipsheet from a conference and wants me to create a JSON object with specific keys. First, I'll identify each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

Starting with the id, it's given as T2714. Next, for authors, I need to extract names, emails, and affiliations. Looking through the text, I see mentions of "Tipsheet for Tipsheet" which might be a heading, but no specific author names are listed. Therefore, the authors list will have nulls for name, email, and affiliation.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE", so that's straightforward. The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the provided text, so I'll set it to "Not Listed". 

For the title, the heading says "Tipsheet for Tipsheet", which seems appropriate. The description should be a brief summary of the content. The tipsheet covers investigative reporting strategies, including using databases and research, so I'll craft a concise sentence about that.

Keywords are next. I need up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Relevant keywords from the text include "investigative journalism", "databases", "research methods", "ethics", and "reporting strategies".

Putting it all together, I'll structure each key with appropriate values, ensuring everything is in English and enclosed in quotes as per JSON standards.

```json

  "id": "T2714",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Tipsheet for Tipsheet",
  "description": "A tipsheet providing strategies and resources for investigative journalism, including the use of databases, research methods, and ethical considerations.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative journalism",
    "databases",
    "research methods",
    "ethics",
    "reporting strategies"
  ]
}
```
