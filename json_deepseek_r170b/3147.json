Okay, I need to create a JSON object from the given input based on specific instructions. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the input, the title of the tipsheet is "Watchdog/Internet 101" and the subtitle is "Getting the Most from the Internet." The author is Neil Reisner, who is affiliated with Florida International University. His email isn't provided in the text, so that will be null.

The conference mentioned is the Investigative Reporters & Editors (IRE) Conference held in Miami in 2008, so the conference key should be "IRE" and the year is 2008.

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet seems to discuss both the pitfalls of relying too much on the internet for journalism and provides various online resources and search techniques. So, a 1-2 sentence summary would capture that it helps journalists effectively use the internet without becoming lazy and highlights useful tools.

Keywords should be no more than five terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords include "watchdog journalism," "internet research," "public records," "search techniques," and "government sources."

Putting this all together, I'll structure the JSON with id 3147, authors as a list containing Neil Reisner's details, the specific conference info, title, description, and selected keywords.

```json
{
  "id": 3147,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Neil Reisner",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Florida International University"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2008,
  "title": "Watchdog/Internet 101",
  "description": "A guide to effectively using the internet for investigative journalism, highlighting both pitfalls and useful resources.",
  "keywords": [
    "watchdog journalism",
    "internet research",
    "public records",
    "search techniques",
    "government sources"
  ]
}
```
