Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions about what each key should contain. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the id is straightforwardâ€”3781. Next, authors are listed as an array of objects with name, email, and affiliation. Looking through the document, I see Sheila S. Coronel is mentioned at the end with her contact info. Her email is scoronel@columbia.edu, and she's affiliated with Columbia University's Stabile Center for Investigative Journalism. There aren't other authors listed, so the array will only have her details.

The conference key should be "IRE" since this tipsheet is from an IRE event. The year isn't explicitly mentioned anywhere in the text, so I'll set it to "Not Listed". 

For the title, I need something descriptive yet concise. Since the document focuses on tracing looted wealth and includes methods like asset tracing and piercing corporate veils, a suitable title would be "Tracing Looting Wealth: Investigative Techniques".

The description should summarize the content in 1-2 sentences. The tipsheet provides tools and methods for tracking illicit funds, so I'll write that it gives tools and techniques to track such wealth.

Keywords are up to five terms. From the document, relevant terms include "asset tracing", "corporate veil", "illicit capital flight", "shell companies", and "financial investigations". These capture the essence without including the conference or authors.

Putting it all together, I structure each key with appropriate values, ensuring correct syntax and nesting for the JSON object. I double-check that all required fields are present and correctly formatted.
