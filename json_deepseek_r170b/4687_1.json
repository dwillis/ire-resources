Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Kendall Taggart at NICAR 2016 titled "Humanizing Numbers." Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the ID is given as 4687_1, that's straightforward. The authors section should be a list. Kendall Taggart is mentioned clearly, so her name is filled in. Her email and affiliation are provided at the end of the tipsheet: kendall.taggart@buzzfeed.com and Buzzfeed News, respectively.

Next, the conference is NICAR since it's from NICAR 2016. The year is obviously 2016. The title is "Humanizing Numbers."

For the description, I need a concise summary. Kendall's talk focuses on using data to find real people and effectively communicate statistics through storytelling. So, something like: "Tipsheet discussing how journalists can use data to identify real people and convey statistics effectively through storytelling."

Keywords should be no more than five. From the content, relevant terms are "data journalism," "investigative reporting," "storytelling with data," "statistics communication," and "NICAR." Wait, but NICAR is part of the conference, so maybe exclude it as a keyword since we already have the conference field. Alternatively, I can include it if needed. Looking back at the example provided, they included NICAR in keywords, so I'll do the same.

Putting it all together, each part maps to the JSON structure without any issues. Making sure not to invent anything and keep the language simple.
