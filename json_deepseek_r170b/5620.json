Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet about investigative reporting on wildlife topics. The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, I'll start by identifying the id, which is given as 5620. That's straightforward.

Next, the authors. Looking through the text, there are several stories mentioned from different news organizations like Mother Jones, National Geographic, Sacramento Bee, etc. Each story has an author listed, but their names aren't providedâ€”only the titles and sources. Since the user specified not to make up any names and leave them as null if none are listed, I'll set each author's name to null. The affiliation should be the news organization they're writing for, so that will be included.

The conference key needs to be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Since this tipsheet is from an IRE event, I'll mark it as "IRE".

For the year, I need to check if there's a clear year mentioned. The tipsheet itself doesn't have a date, but some of the stories cited are from 2012, 2014, etc. However, without a specific year for the conference, I'll set this to "Not Listed" as per instructions.

The description should be a concise summary of the text in simple terms. The tipsheet covers various resources and story ideas related to investigative wildlife reporting, so I'll craft a brief sentence that captures that essence.

Keywords are next. They should be no more than five terms, excluding conference names or authors. From the content, relevant keywords might include "wildlife", "investigative journalism", "conservation", "poaching", and "environmental crime".

Putting it all together, I'll structure each element carefully to ensure compliance with the user's specifications.
