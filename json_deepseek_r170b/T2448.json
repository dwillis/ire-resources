Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided input. Let me go through this step by step.

First, the user wants an id of T2448. That's straightforward. 

Next, looking for authors. The text mentions Carolyn Edds as the presenter from the St. Petersburg Times. There are no other authors listed, so I'll only include her. Her email and affiliation aren't provided, so those fields will be null.

The conference is clearly stated as the annual Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference in Denver, June 2-5, 2005. So, conference is "IRE" and year is 2005.

For the title, it's about backgrounding people using online resources, so I'll summarize that.

The description needs to be a short summary of what Carolyn presented. She discussed tips for using Google and other tools for research. I should keep it simple.

Keywords are important. The main topics include investigative journalism, online research, Google search tips, resource center, and backgrounding. I'll list these as keywords without exceeding five terms.

Putting it all together, the JSON structure should have id, authors (array with one object), conference, year, title, description, and keywords. All keys are in quotes, and proper values filled in accordingly.

I think that's everything. Let me make sure no details are missed.
