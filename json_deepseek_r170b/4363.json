Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given input. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id is provided as 4363, so that's straightforward.

Next, authors. The text includes "Nicole", but only the name is mentioned without any email or affiliation. Since no other authors are listed, I'll set authors to an array with one object where name is "Nicole" and email and affiliation are null.

The conference is clearly stated as NICAR, so that's easy.

For the year, looking at the input, it says "March 5-8, 2020," which indicates the event was in 2020. So I'll set the year to 2020.

The title isn't directly provided, but the document is about basic statistical analysis using Excel. I'll create a concise title like "Basic Statistical Analysis with Excel."

The description needs to be a simple summary. The text covers interpreting p-values and regression results, so I'll phrase it accordingly: "This document provides a guide on performing basic statistical analysis in Excel, focusing on interpreting p-values and regression results."

For keywords, the main topics are p-value, regression analysis, Excel, statistical significance, and data analysis. These are all relevant and within five terms.

I need to ensure all keys and values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, I shouldn't include any extra information beyond what's provided.
