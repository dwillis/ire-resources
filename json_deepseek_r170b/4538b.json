Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, I'll start with the "id" which is given as "4538b". Next, for the "authors", there are two handles mentioned: @MeganLuther and @IRE_NICAR. Since Megan Luther is a person, her name will be used, and she's affiliated with IRE. The other handle is an organization, so its name will be null with affiliation as NICAR.

The "conference" key should be "IRE" because the tipsheet is from an IRE conference. The year isn't provided, so it remains "Not Listed". 

For the title, looking at the content, it's about using data and documents in investigations, so I'll name it "Using Data and Documents in Investigative Reporting".

The description needs to be a concise summary. It should mention how data and documents are crucial tools for journalists, suggesting creative methods to obtain information and emphasizing the importance of understanding retention schedules.

Keywords are limited to five. The main points include data analysis, document retention, FOIA, investigative journalism, and public records.

I need to structure all this into a JSON object with appropriate keys and ensure that all values are enclosed in quotes. No markdown should be used, so I'll present it cleanly.

    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
