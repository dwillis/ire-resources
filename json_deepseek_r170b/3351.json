Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The input provided includes details like the title of the session, authors with their emails and affiliations, and several sections with tips on managing CAR (Computer-Assisted Reporting) work.

First, I'll start by identifying each key required in the JSON object: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The user specified that the id should be 3351, so I'll set that as a string since IDs are often numeric but can sometimes be strings depending on the system.

Next, the authors section needs to be an array of objects, each with name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the input, there are two authors listed: MaryJo Webster from St. Paul Pioneer Press and David Heath from Huffington Post Investigative Fund. Their emails are provided, so I'll include those. Since their affiliations are clearly stated next to their names, I don't need to infer anything; I can directly assign them.

For the conference key, the user mentioned it's an IRE conference, so that will be set as "IRE". The year isn't specified in the input provided, so according to instructions, I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

The title is given as "Juggling and managing CAR work - How to cover a beat and still produce investigative, CAR-based stories." That's clear, so I can use that directly.

The description needs to be a concise 1-2 sentence summary. The session covers how reporters can manage their daily tasks while producing investigative stories using CAR techniques. So the summary should reflect that balance between daily responsibilities and longer-term projects.

Keywords are next, up to five terms excluding conference names or authors. From the content, relevant keywords would include "CAR", "time management", "investigative reporting", "efficiency", and "collaboration". These capture the essence of managing work and using data effectively.

I should ensure all values are in English as per instructions since the original text is in English. Also, every key and value must be enclosed in quotes to maintain proper JSON formatting.

Putting it all together, I structure each part step by step, making sure not to miss any required fields or incorrectly format anything. Double-checking for any typos or missed information is essential before finalizing the JSON.
