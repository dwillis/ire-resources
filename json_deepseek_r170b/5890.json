Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. The user provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference titled "Making Time for Investigative Work in a Daily Newsroom." They want this information structured with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, I'll assign the id as 5890 since that's what the user specified. Next, the authors are Margaret Haberman from The Oregonian/OregonLive, Steve Riley from the Houston Chronicle, and Shawn McIntosh from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Since emails aren't provided, they'll be null. Each author gets an entry in the list with their name and affiliation.

The conference is clearly IRE, so that's set. Looking at the text, there's no specific year mentioned, so I'll put "Not Listed" for the year. The title remains as given: "Making Time for Investigative Work in a Daily Newsroom."

For the description, I need to summarize it into 1-2 sentences. It should capture how investigative journalism can coexist with daily news without sacrificing quality. 

Keywords are next. They should be relevant and no more than five. From the content, terms like "investigative journalism," "daily newsroom," "newsroom management," "journalism practices," and "editorial strategies" fit well.

Putting it all together, I structure each key with appropriate values ensuring everything is in English and enclosed in quotes.
