Alright, so I need to create a JSON object from the given input based on specific instructions. The user provided a tipsheet titled "TIME IS MONEY – AND I’M OUT OF IT!!!" which seems to be from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. 

First, I'll identify each required key for the JSON:

1. **id**: It's given as 3707.
2. **authors**: The input doesn't list any authors, so this will be an empty array.
3. **conference**: Since it's about investigative reporting and mentions strategies common in such contexts, I'll assume it's from "IRE".
4. **year**: There’s no specific year mentioned, so it should be "Not Listed".
5. **title**: The title is clearly given as "TIME IS MONEY – AND I’M OUT OF IT!!!".
6. **description**: I need a concise 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet provides quick strategies for investigative journalism on tight deadlines, so the description could reflect that.
7. **keywords**: Extract relevant terms without including the conference or authors. Possible keywords are "investigative reporting", "time management", "FOIA requests", "tax breaks", and "local government expenses".

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part carefully to ensure accuracy and adherence to the instructions. Making sure not to include any made-up names and correctly handling cases where information isn't provided.
