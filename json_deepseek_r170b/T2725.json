Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to create this JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has specific instructions, so I need to make sure I follow them carefully.

First, I'll start by identifying the key components they want in the JSON: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. They mentioned that the ID should be T2725, which is straightforward.

Looking at the authors section, there are three names listed: Burnis Morris from Marshall University, Ronald Campbell from OC Register, and Paul Clolery from NonProfit Times. The user wants each author to have name, email, and affiliation. Since emails aren't provided in the text, I'll leave those as null. Affiliations are clearly stated next to their names, so that's easy.

Next is the conference field. The tipsheet mentions it's from an IRE conference, so I'll set that accordingly. As for the year, the original response didn't include it, and thereâ€™s no indication in the text provided, so I'll default to "Not Listed".

The title of the session is "Beyond Bake Sales: Investigating Nonprofits", which makes sense as a descriptive title.

For the description, I need a concise 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet talks about why nonprofits are important to cover because of their size and impact, and how to investigate them by looking at key documents and relationships. So I'll phrase that into a clear summary.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, "nonprofits", "investigation", "financial oversight", "abuse", and "accountability" seem relevant.

I also need to ensure all values are in English unless otherwise specified and use quotation marks around keys and string values. The structure should be a valid JSON without any markdown formatting as per the user's request.

Double-checking everything, I think that covers all the requirements laid out by the user.
