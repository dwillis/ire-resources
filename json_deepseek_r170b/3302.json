Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference in Baltimore, 2009. The user has specified several keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, the id is given as 3302, so that's straightforward.

Next, for the authors, I see two names mentioned: Aaron Kessler and Jaimi Dowdell. Their emails and affiliations are provided at the end of the document. Aaron is affiliated with Herald Tribune, and Jaimi is from IRE. So, each author entry will have their name, email, and affiliation filled out.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE Baltimore - 2009," so the conference key should be "IRE" since that's one of the specified options.

The year is obviously 2009, as mentioned in the header.

For the title, looking at the document, it starts with "Social Network Analysis," which seems to be the main topic. So I'll use that as the title.

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary of the tipsheet. The document talks about using social network analysis for investigative reporting, mentioning how it helps visualize relationships and analyze connections to uncover power sources or stories. I'll condense this into one or two sentences.

Looking at keywords, they should exclude the conference and authors. From the content, relevant terms are "social networks," "investigative journalism," "data visualization," "relationship analysis," and "power structures." These capture the essence without overlapping with other keys.

I need to ensure all values are in English since the original text is in English, and enclose everything in quotes as per JSON standards. Also, I must avoid making up any information and stick strictly to what's provided.
