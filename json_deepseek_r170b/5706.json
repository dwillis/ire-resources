Okay, I'm trying to help create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference workshop. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, I'll start by identifying each required key's value. 

The id is straightforward; it should be 5706 as per the instructions.

Next, looking at the authors section. The tipsheet mentions Adelaide Chen with her email and affiliation. So, I can create an author object with name "Adelaide Chen", email "achen@orlandosentinel.com", and affiliation "Orlando Sentinel". There's only one author mentioned here, so that's the list.

Conference is clearly stated as "IRE" since it's from an IRE18 workshop.

The year is given in the context as June 2018, so that will be 2018.

For the title, the main focus seems to be on converting PDF tables into spreadsheets. So a suitable title could be "Converting PDF Tables to Spreadsheets".

The description needs to be a concise summary of what the tipsheet covers. It should mention the tools and methods discussed, like using OCR, Tabula, CometDocs, and command-line tools for handling PDFs, especially useful when on deadline.

Keywords should include relevant terms that capture the essence without including the conference or authors. So I'll list "PDF conversion", "OCR tools", "Tabula", "data extraction", and "spreadsheet creation".

I need to ensure all values are in English since the original text is in English, and keys are properly quoted.

Now, putting it all together into a JSON structure following these points.

```json
{
  "id": 5706,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Adelaide Chen",
      "email": "achen@orlandosentinel.com",
      "affiliation": "Orlando Sentinel"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2018,
  "title": "Converting PDF Tables to Spreadsheets",
  "description": "This tipsheet provides methods and tools for converting PDF tables into spreadsheets, including using OCR, Tabula, CometDocs, and command-line tools. It offers practical steps for handling scanned or exported PDFs efficiently.",
  "keywords": [
    "PDF conversion",
    "OCR tools",
    "Tabula",
    "data extraction",
    "spreadsheet creation"
  ]
}
```
