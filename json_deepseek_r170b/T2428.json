Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, looking at the input provided. The title of the tipsheet is "Choosing Stories." There are several points listed under that topic, but no author name is explicitly mentioned except for David Milliron, who is affiliated with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. So, I should include him in the authors list.

Next, I need to determine the conference. Since it's from Investigative Reporters and Editors, the conference key will be "IRE." The year isn't provided in the input, so I'll set it as "Not Listed."

For the description, I have to summarize the content in 1-2 sentences using simple language. The tipsheet talks about how CAR (Computer-Assisted Reporting) stories start with great ideas and involve data analysis, accuracy, and getting editorial buy-in early.

Now, keywords. They should be no more than five terms excluding the conference or authors. From the content, relevant keywords include "CAR," "data journalism," "watchdog reporting," "accuracy in reporting," and "editorial buy-in."

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part accordingly, ensuring all fields are enclosed in quotes and that the JSON syntax is correct.

```json

  "id": "T2428",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Atlanta Journal-Constitution"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Choosing Stories",
  "description": "Tipsheet discussing how CAR stories start with great ideas, the importance of accuracy and editorial buy-in.",
  "keywords": [
    "CAR",
    "data journalism",
    "watchdog reporting",
    "accuracy in reporting",
    "editorial buy-in"
  ]
}
```
