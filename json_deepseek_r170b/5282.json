Alright, I need to help this user create a JSON object from their provided query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me read through the query carefully.

The query includes a session titled "Building Your Career Roundtable" from the IRE Annual Conference in Phoenix, 2017. The speakers mentioned are Christine Mai-Duc from LA Times, Hilary Powell, Jill Riepenhoff, and Stephen Stock who provided the tipsheet. 

First, I should identify each part of the JSON structure as per the user's instructions. The id is given as 5282. Next, the authors list needs to include each speaker with their name, email, and affiliation. Since emails aren't provided, they'll be null. Affiliations are based on the news organizations mentioned; for example, Christine Mai-Duc is affiliated with LA Times.

The conference is clearly IRE Annual Conference 2017 in Phoenix, so the conference key will be "IRE". The year is explicitly 2017. 

For the title, it's straightforward: "Building Your Career Roundtable". The description needs to be a concise summary of the contentâ€”maybe something about career advice and professional development for journalists.

Keywords should include relevant terms like career development, journalism, networking, mentorship, and professional growth, excluding the conference name and authors. I'll stick to five keywords as instructed.

I also need to make sure all keys are enclosed in quotes and values are in English unless specified otherwise. Since there's no made-up information, everything is based on the provided text.

Let me structure this step by step to ensure each part of the JSON meets the user's requirements accurately.
