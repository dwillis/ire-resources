Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tip sheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given me specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, I'll note that the id is fixed as 3093. That part is straightforward.

Next, looking at the tip sheet, it's titled "FINDING AND BACKGROUNDING PEOPLE" and presented by Christopher Scholl from CBS NEWS. Since there are no other authors mentioned, the authors list will have only one entry with his name, affiliation as CBS NEWS, but email is null because it's not provided.

The conference is clearly an IRE event, so that key is set to "IRE". The year isn't specified in the text, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

For the title, it's exactly as given: "FINDING AND BACKGROUNDING PEOPLE".

Now, the description needs to be a concise 1-2 sentence summary. The tip sheet talks about investigative tools for finding and backgrounding people, both professional and free resources. So I'll summarize that.

Keywords should be no more than five terms. From the content, relevant keywords are "investigative tools", "people search", "background checks", "public records", and "research methods".

I need to ensure all keys and values are in English and enclosed in quotes. Also, since there's no year provided, I'll set that field accordingly.

Putting it all together, the JSON structure should accurately reflect each part of the tip sheet as per the instructions.
