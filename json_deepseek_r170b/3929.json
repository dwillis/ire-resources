Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet from Barbara Gray in June 2013.

First, I'll identify the required keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 3929. 

Looking at the content, the author is Barbara Gray with an email provided. Her affiliation is CUNY Graduate School of Journalism. So, the authors array will have one object with her details.

The conference is IRE, and the year is June 2013, so those fields are straightforward.

For the title, it's "Beyond Google 2013". The description needs to be a concise summary. I'll mention that it's a tipsheet covering advanced search techniques and tools for journalists, including avoiding filter bubbles and using specific resources on LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.

Keywords should include terms like "filter bubbles", "anonymous searching", "LinkedIn", "Twitter", and "domain search" as they are key topics covered.

I need to ensure all values are in English and correctly formatted. No markdown or extra text should be included, just the JSON object.
