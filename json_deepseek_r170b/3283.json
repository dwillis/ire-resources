Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's input about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me break down the requirements step by step.

First, the structure should include id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is given as 3283, so that's straightforward.

Looking at the authors section, the input mentions Tisha Thompson from Fox 5 News with her contact details. I'll list her name, email, and affiliation. Since the email in the input has a typo (foxh,.com), I should correct it to fox.com for accuracy.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's set. The year isn't provided in the text, so it defaults to "Not Listed".

For the title, the main topic is Broadcast CAR: Quick Hits & Sweeps Packages, which I'll use verbatim.

The description needs a concise summary. The tipsheet provides data-driven journalism strategies using CAR (Computer-Assisted Reporting) techniques for breaking news scenarios. So, I'll phrase it to reflect that clearly in one or two sentences.

Keywords should be relevant and limited to five terms. From the content, "Broadcast Journalism", "CAR", "Investigative Reporting", "Quick Hits", and "Data-Driven Journalism" are appropriate without including the conference name or author names.

I also need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes, with no markdown formatting as per the user's instruction.
