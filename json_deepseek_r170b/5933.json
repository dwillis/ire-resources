Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has specified that the response should only include this JSON object without any additional text.

First, let me break down what's needed. The keys required are: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. 

Starting with the ID, it's given as 5933. That's straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors. The tipsheet is by Georg Neumann from the Open Contracting Partnership. So the authors list should have one entry with name "Georg Neumann", email "gneumann@open-contracting.org" and affiliation "Open Contracting Partnership". 

The conference is mentioned as IRE, so that's clear. The year isn't provided in the text, so it'll be "Not Listed".

For the title, the tipsheet is titled "Using data to uncover corruption in public procurement", which seems accurate.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The main point is using data to find corruption in government contracting. So I'll phrase that clearly.

Keywords should be no more than five terms. From the content, relevant keywords are public procurement, corruption, Open Contracting Data Standard, red flags, and investigative journalism.

Putting it all together, each key needs to be correctly formatted with quotes around them. The authors are an array of objects, so I'll structure that properly.

Double-checking for any missing information or errors. Since the year isn't listed in the text, it remains "Not Listed". All other fields seem covered.
