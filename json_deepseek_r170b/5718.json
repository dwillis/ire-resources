Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided input for an IRE conference tipsheet. The id is given as 5718. 

First, looking at authors: the input doesn't mention any specific names, so I'll set each author's name to null. Their emails and affiliations are also not provided, so those will be null too.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE". Since there's no year mentioned in the text, I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

For the title, the tipsheet covers various resources for journalists, so I'll name it "Reporter’s Guide to Investigative Resources".

In the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet offers numerous tools and websites helping journalists track money, lobbying, nonprofits, legislation, etc., so that's what I'll mention.

Keywords should be up to five relevant terms. From the content, keywords like "investigative journalism", "lobbying", "legislation tracking", "nonprofit research", and "political spending" fit well.

I need to ensure all keys are in quotes and values are properly formatted. No made-up names or data—everything strictly from the input.
