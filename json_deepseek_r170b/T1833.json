Alright, so I've got this query to process. The user provided a bunch of text from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet about the Census data. They want me to create a specific JSON object based on that information.

First, I need to parse through the content. The title is "Census 101" by Steve Doig from Arizona State University. So, the authors list should have one entry with his name, and since there's no email or affiliation beyond ASU, those fields will be null except for affiliation as "Arizona State University".

The conference is clearly IRE, so that goes into the conference field. The year isn't mentioned in the provided text, so I'll set it to "Not Listed". 

For the description, I need a concise summary. It's about how journalists can use Census data for stories, covering demographics, housing, and economy. That should fit into 1-2 sentences.

Keywords are next. The main topics are Census data, redistricting, demographic analysis, housing statistics, economic trends. I'll pick five relevant terms without including the conference or authors.

Putting it all together, making sure each field is correctly formatted as per the user's instructions. No markdown, just a clean JSON object.
