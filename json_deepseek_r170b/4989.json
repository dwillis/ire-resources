Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me start by understanding what they're asking for.

First, looking at their input, it seems like they provided details from a tipsheet titled "Following the Money" presented by Jonathan D. Salant at the IRE Watchdog Workshop in Stony Brook, N.Y. They want this information structured into a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

I notice they specified that the 'id' should be 4989. Got it. Next, for the 'authors' key, it needs to be an array of objects each containing name, email, and affiliation. In the provided text, Jonathan D. Salant is listed with his email and affiliation as NJ Advance Media/The Star-Ledger. So I'll include that information correctly.

The 'conference' should be one of "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Since this is an IRE Watchdog Workshop, it clearly falls under "IRE".

They also mentioned the 'year' field, but in the input, there's no specific year provided. So I'll set that to "Not Listed" as per their instructions.

For the 'title', it's straightforward: "Following the Money". 

The 'description' needs a concise 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet covers tracking campaign contributions and lobbying using online resources like OpenSecrets, FEC, etc., so I'll craft a simple sentence that encapsulates that.

Lastly, the 'keywords' should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Relevant keywords here would include "campaign finance", "lobbying", "public records", "political donations", and "government transparency".

Putting it all together, I need to structure each part accurately without making up any information. If something isn't provided, like the year, I'll leave it as "Not Listed". Also, ensuring that all keys are properly enclosed in quotes and the JSON syntax is correct.

I think that's everything. Now, I can draft the JSON object accordingly.
