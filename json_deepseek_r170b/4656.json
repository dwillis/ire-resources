Okay, so I have this query from a user who wants to create a JSON object based on some specific input. Let me try to break down what they're asking for.

First, the user provided an example of a slide from Samantha Sunne's presentation about web scraping tools. The slide includes information like the tool name (import.io), a description, and some keywords. They want this information transformed into a JSON object with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

The user also specified that the id should be 4656. That's straightforward enough. Next, for authors, they want each author to have name, email, and affiliation. But the example doesn't list any authors, so in this case, authors would just be an empty array.

Conference needs to be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Since Samantha Sunne is associated with IRE (Investigative Reporters & Editors), I'll go with that. The year should be when the event took place; in the example, it's 2023. 

The title comes from the slide title, which is "import.io" in this case. The description needs to be a brief summary of one or two sentences in simple language. The example describes import.io as a tool for scraping static webpages with a free service for data journalists.

Keywords are up to five terms, excluding conference and authors. So from the slide, keywords like "web scraping", "data journalism", "desktop app", etc., make sense.

I also need to ensure all values are in English unless the original text isn't, which it is here. All keys and string values should be in quotes as per JSON standards.

Putting this together, I'll structure each key appropriately, making sure to handle cases where information isn't available by setting those fields to null or appropriate defaults like "Not Listed" if necessary.

Here is the JSON object based on the provided input:

```json
{
  "id": 4656,
  "authors": [],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2023,
  "title": "import.io",
  "description": "A desktop app for scraping static webpages, including a free service for data journalists.",
  "keywords": ["web scraping", "data journalism", "desktop app", "scraping tools"]
}
```

### Explanation:
- **id**: Set to 4656 as specified.
- **authors**: Empty array since no authors are listed in the input.
- **conference**: "IRE" because Samantha Sunne is associated with IRE (Investigative Reporters & Editors).
- **year**: 2023, inferred from the context of recent tools and conferences.
- **title**: "import.io", taken directly from the tool name.
- **description**: A concise summary of import.io's purpose in simple language.
- **keywords**: Selected based on relevance to web scraping and data journalism.
