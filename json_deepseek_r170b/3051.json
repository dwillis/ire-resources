Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet regarding Canadian aviation data.

First, looking at the id, it should be 3051 as specified. The authors are mentioned with name, email, and affiliation. Fred Vallance-Jones is listed with his email and affiliation at University of King’s College. So the authors array will have one object with his details.

The conference is identified as IRE since the handout is for an IRE/CAR Conference in Houston. The year isn't explicitly mentioned, so it'll be "Not Listed".

For the title, the main topic is obtaining Canadian aviation data, so I'll use that. The description needs to be concise, summarizing how reporters can access this data despite challenges.

Keywords should include relevant terms like CADORS, SDRs, Transport Canada, and TSB since they're central to the content. 

Putting it all together, ensuring each key is correctly formatted with quotes and proper structure.
