Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The input provided is from NICAR 2014 in Baltimore, titled "EDITING THE DATA PROJECT" by Maud Beelman.

First, I'll identify each required key for the JSON object:

1. **id**: Given as 4084_Part_2.
2. **authors**: A list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. From the input, Maud Beelman's email is provided, and her affiliation is The Dallas Morning News. No other authors are mentioned, so the list has one entry.
3. **conference**: The input mentions NICAR 2014, so conference is "NICAR".
4. **year**: Clearly stated as 2014.
5. **title**: "EDITING THE DATA PROJECT" needs to be in quotes.
6. **description**: A 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet offers advice for editors working with data projects, focusing on understanding and verifying data, methodology, and collaborating with reporters.
7. **keywords**: Up to five terms. From the content, relevant keywords are "data journalism", "editing", "investigative reporting", "NICAR", and "methodology".

Now, I'll structure each part:

- The authors array will have one object with Maud Beelman's details.
- Conference is NICAR, year 2014.
- Title is as given.
- Description succinctly captures the essence of the tipsheet.
- Keywords are selected based on content relevance.

I need to ensure all strings are in English and properly quoted. No markdown should be present, so the final output will be a clean JSON object without any additional formatting beyond what's required.

Double-checking for any missing information or errors: The id is correct, authors have all available info, conference and year are accurate, title and description are appropriately written, and keywords are relevant and within the limit.
