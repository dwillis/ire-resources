Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given input from NICAR 2018. Let's break down what the user provided.

First, the conference is clearly NICAR 18, so that's straightforward. The year would be 2018 since it's in the conference name. 

Looking at the content, Amaya Verde is mentioned as the speaker with her email and affiliation to Univision. So, the authors array should have one object with her details.

The title of the tipsheet seems to focus on using infographics and dataviz for entertainment news, so I'll note that.

For the description, it's about how these visual tools help in presenting celebrity data and relationships dynamically. I need a concise summary.

Keywords would include Infographics, Dataviz, Entertainment News, Celebrity Relationships, since those are central themes.

I'll structure all this into the required JSON format with the specified keys.

```json
{
  "id": 5478,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": 2018,
  "title": "Infographics and Dataviz as Non-Traditional Ways to Tell Entertainment News Stories Digitally",
  "description": "This tipsheet explores how infographics and data visualizations can be used to tell entertainment news stories in a non-traditional way, focusing on celebrity relationships and audience engagement.",
  "keywords": ["Infographics", "Dataviz", "Entertainment News", "Celebrity Relationships"]
}
```
