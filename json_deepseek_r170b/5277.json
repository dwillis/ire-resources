Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, looking at the input, the title of the session is "Animation for Storytelling" presented by Kavya Sukumar. Her affiliation is Vox Media's Storytelling Studio, and she was an OpenNews Fellow in 2015. So under authors, I'll include her name, set email to null since it's not provided, and use her affiliation.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that goes into the conference field. The year isn't mentioned, so I'll leave it as "Not Listed".

For the description, I need a concise summary. Kavya's talk covers using animation in journalism, focusing on tools like After Effects and integrating animations into various platforms. She also provides resources for learning.

Keywords should include relevant terms without mentioning the conference or author names. So, I'll go with "animation", "storytelling", "After Effects", "journalism", and "video production".

I need to ensure all keys are in quotes and the structure is correct. No markdown, just plain JSON.

    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Animation for Storytelling",
  "description": "Learn the basics of creating animations using tools like After Effects, and how to integrate them into your storytelling.",
  "keywords": [
