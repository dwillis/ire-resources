Alright, I need to help the user by creating a JSON object from their provided input. The instructions specify several keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, I'll set the id as "T2096" since that's what they asked for. Next, looking at the text, there are no authors mentioned, so the authors list will be empty.

Now, determining the conference. The input refers to "IRE National Conference," so I should categorize it under the "IRE" conference.

The year isn't explicitly stated in the provided text, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

For the title, the main topic seems to be about investigative reporting resources, so I'll go with a general title like "Investigative Reporting Resources."

The description needs to be concise. The text covers various methods for gathering information on individuals and organizations, including court records, public documents, and online tools. So, I'll summarize that in one or two sentences.

Finally, the keywords should capture the essence without listing the conference or authors. Terms like "investigative journalism," "court records," "public documents," "political contributions," and "military records" are appropriate.

Putting it all together, ensuring each key is properly formatted with quotes and values are correctly assigned.
