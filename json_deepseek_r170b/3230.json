Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given input. The user provided some notes from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference, specifically NICAR in Indianapolis from 2009 about Social Network Analysis.

First, let's break down the components needed for the JSON:

1. **id**: It should be 3230.
2. **authors**: A list where each author has name, email, affiliation. The input doesn't mention any authors by name, so I'll set name to null. Email and affiliation can also be null since there's no info provided.
3. **conference**: Clearly mentioned as NICAR Conference in Indianapolis 2009.
4. **year**: The date is April 10, 2009, so year should be 2009.
5. **title**: From the header, it's "Social Network Analysis".
6. **description**: Needs to be a concise summary of what Social Network Analysis allows you to do and some applications. Looking at the points, it helps filter data, visualize connections, analyze relationships, discover power sources, find new story angles in various fields like government, crime, public health, etc.
7. **keywords**: From the content, relevant terms are social network analysis, investigative journalism, data visualization, relationship mapping, and networks.

Putting this all together, I structure each part accordingly without adding any made-up information. Since there's no author listed, authors remain as nulls. The description is crafted to be clear and within two sentences, highlighting the key benefits and applications of the technique.
