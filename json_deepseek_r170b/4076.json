Alright, I need to create a JSON object from the provided tipsheet based on the user's specifications. Let me go through this step by step.

First, I'll read through the input carefully to extract necessary information. The tipsheet is about using NodeXL for network analysis, presented at NICAR 2014 in Baltimore by Peter Aldhous. 

The id should be 4076 as per the user's instruction. Next, looking at the authors section: there's only one author mentioned, Peter Aldhous, with his email and Twitter handle. His affiliation isn't explicitly stated, but since he's presenting at a journalism conference, I'll assume his affiliation is with Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE).

The conference is clearly NICAR 2014, so the conference field is "NICAR". The year is given as 2014 in the tipsheet. 

For the title, it should be concise. The main topic is "NodeXL for Network Analysis," so I'll use that.

The description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary. I'll note that it's a hands-on guide on using NodeXL for analyzing social and political networks, emphasizing its application in journalism.

Keywords are next. They should exclude the conference and authors. Relevant terms include "network analysis," "NodeXL," "social media," "journalism tools," and "data visualization."

Putting this all together, I'll structure the JSON with each specified key, ensuring that all values are correctly formatted as per the instructions.
