Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. The input provided seems like a talk or an article discussing data journalism and analysis. 

First, I'll look for the ID: it should be T2143 as given.

Next, authors. The text mentions Edward Callabrese from the University of Massachusetts, so I can add him with his affiliation. There's also mention of a study by academics but no specific names, so I'll leave the other author fields null except for affiliation if applicable.

Conference: The user mentioned it could be IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed. Since there's no clear indication here, I'll set it to "Not Listed".

Year: No specific year is given in the text, so I'll use "Not Listed" again.

Title: It should capture the essence of data journalism and analysis, maybe something like "Sophisticated Data Analysis in Journalism".

Description: A concise summary of the text. It's about using data analysis to bridge academia and public understanding, ensuring credibility.

Keywords: Extract relevant terms from the content: data analysis, journalism, statistics, credibility, academic research.

Now, I'll structure all this into a JSON object with the specified keys.
