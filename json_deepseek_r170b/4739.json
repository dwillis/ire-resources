Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let's break down the requirements step by step.

First, the structure should include id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The ID is provided as 4739. 

Looking at the input, the author mentioned is Charles Ornstein with a Twitter handle @charlesornstein. Since there's no email or affiliation explicitly listed, I'll set his name to "Charles Ornstein" and both email and affiliation to null because the tipsheet doesn't provide that info.

The conference is clearly an IRE event as indicated in the note. The year given in the input is March 12, 2016, so the year should be 2016. 

For the title, it's "MY FAVORITE HEALTH DATA SETS". The description needs to be a concise summary of the tipsheet content. It lists various health data resources like inspection reports and opioid data, so I'll craft a brief sentence capturing that.

Keywords are next. They should exclude the conference name and authors but include relevant terms. From the content, "Health Data", "Inspection Reports", "Opioid Epidemic", "Pharma Payments", and "Patient Privacy" seem appropriate and within the five-term limit.

I need to ensure all keys are in quotes and values are properly formatted. No markdown should be present as per the user's request.
