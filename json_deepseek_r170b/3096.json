Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let's break down what each part of the query is asking for.

First, the user wants specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The ID is given as 3096, so that's straightforward. 

Next, looking at the authors section. The tipsheet mentions Mike Huckman from CNBC. His email and phone number are provided, but since the JSON requires name, email, and affiliation, I'll include his name as "Mike Huckman" with his email and affiliation as CNBC.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's set. The year isn't mentioned in the input, so according to instructions, it should be "Not Listed".

For the title, it's "Where to Score Good Drug Stories". 

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary of the tipsheet. The main points are about sources for pharmaceutical industry news, including specific websites and their purposes. So I'll write a 1-2 sentence summary capturing that.

Keywords should include terms like drug stories, pharmaceutical industry, sources, but limited to five. I'll list "drug stories", "pharmaceutical industry", "sources", "investigative journalism", and "tipsheet".

I also need to ensure all values are in English and enclosed in quotes. Double-checking each part to make sure nothing is missed or made up.
