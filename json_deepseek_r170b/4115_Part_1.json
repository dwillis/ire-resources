Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query and the provided tipsheet from the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down the requirements step by step.

First, the structure should include specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is given as "4115_Part_1". 

Looking at the authors section, there are two presenters mentioned: Julie Tate from The Washington Post and Rick Yarborough from NBC Washington. I need to list each author with their name, email, and affiliation. Both have emails and affiliations provided, so that's straightforward.

The conference is specified as "CAR Conference" which stands for Computer-Assisted Reporting, a part of IRE events. So the conference key should be "IRE". The year is clearly stated as 2014, so I'll include that.

The title of the tipsheet is "The Art & Craft of Finding People," which I can use directly. For the description, it needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers various methods and resources for locating individuals using public records, online searches, and social media, so I'll phrase that into a couple of sentences.

Next are the keywords. They should exclude the conference and authors but include relevant terms from the content. "Public records," "investigative reporting," "people search," "backgrounding," and "online research" seem appropriate and within the limit of five.

I also need to ensure all values are in English, enclosed in quotes, and that keys are properly formatted. No made-up names; since both authors have their details, no nulls needed there.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each key with its corresponding value, making sure to handle arrays for authors and keywords correctly.
