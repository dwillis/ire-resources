Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id should be 3581 as specified. The authors are next; I see multiple news organizations listed like NPR, USA Today, and others. Since no specific author names are given, their names will be null. Their affiliations will be the respective news organizations they're from. Emails can be null because there's no information provided.

The conference is "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Looking at the data, I don't see any mention of a conference name, so it should default to "Not Listed".

For the year, the user mentioned that if it's not clearly identified, use "Not Listed". Since there’s no specific year in the text, that’s what I'll put.

The title needs to capture the essence. Maybe something like "Compilation of Investigative Journalism Findings" since each entry is from different investigations.

The description should be a brief summary. I can write something about various news organizations investigating issues like crime stats, environmental pollution, and prison policies, affecting public trust and safety.

Keywords are up to five terms. I'll pick "Investigative journalism", "Crime statistics", "Environmental contamination", "Private prisons", and "Judicial misconduct" as they cover the main topics.

I need to make sure all keys and values are in quotes and that everything is in English unless specified otherwise. No markdown, just plain JSON. Let me structure it accordingly.
