Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through this step by step.

First, I'll read the entire document to understand its content. It's about Joint Fundraising Committees (JFCs), explaining their basics, significance, and how journalists can write stories about them.

The user specified that the JSON should have certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The ID is given as 5651_2, which I'll use exactly. 

Looking at the document, there's no author mentioned anywhere. So for the authors array, each element needs to have name, email, and affiliation. Since no names are provided, I'll set name to null. Email and affiliation can also be null.

The conference is either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". The document mentions it's from an IRE conference, so I'll use "IRE".

The year isn't specified in the text, so I'll put "Not Listed" for that field.

For the title, the tipsheet is about Joint Fundraising Committees, so a suitable title would be "Joint Fundraising Committees Tipsheet".

The description needs to be a concise 1-2 sentence summary. The main point is that JFCs allow multiple committees to raise funds together, with big donors and less transparency. So I'll write something like: "This tipsheet explains how Joint Fundraising Committees (JFCs) enable political committees to pool resources, attract large donations, and raise transparency concerns."

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Relevant keywords are "Joint Fundraising Committees", "Political Contributions", "Campaign Finance", "Transparency", and "Big Donors".

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON accordingly. Each key is in quotes, strings are in quotes, arrays use square brackets, and each element within arrays has its own set of braces with key-value pairs.

I think that's everything. Now, let me make sure there are no typos or missing fields.

```json
{
  "id": "5651_2",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Joint Fundraising Committees Tipsheet",
  "description": "This tipsheet explains how Joint Fundraising Committees (JFCs) enable political committees to pool resources, attract large donations, and raise transparency concerns.",
  "keywords": [
    "Joint Fundraising Committees",
    "Political Contributions",
    "Campaign Finance",
    "Transparency",
    "Big Donors"
  ]
}
```
