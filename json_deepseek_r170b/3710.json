Alright, so I need to create a JSON object from the given input based on specific instructions. Let me break down what's required.

First, the JSON should have keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is straightforward; it's 3710 as provided. 

Next, the authors array. Each author entry needs name, email, and affiliation. The text doesn't mention any names, so each name will be null. Email and affiliation are also null here since there's no information provided.

Conference should be either IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed. Since the input doesnâ€™t specify which conference this is from, it defaults to "Not Listed".

Year is next. The original text doesn't mention a specific year, so year will be "Not Listed" as well.

Title isn't given explicitly in the text. It seems like the main topic revolves around investigative reporting techniques, especially about bond money misuse in a college district. So I'll craft a title that reflects that investigation aspect.

Description needs to be a concise summary of 1-2 sentences in simple language. The text discusses various methods and documents used to uncover misuse of funds, so the description should encapsulate that.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference or authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords might include "investigative reporting", "bond money", "college district", "document analysis", and "financial misconduct".

Putting it all together, I structure each key with appropriate values based on what's available from the input and the guidelines provided.

  "title": "Investigative Reporting on College District Bond Money Misuse",
