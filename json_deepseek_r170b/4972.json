Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The user provided specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, I'll start by identifying the id, which is given as 4972. That's straightforward. Next, looking at the authors section. The document mentions Clarisa Diaz and Hannah Birch, but their emails and affiliations aren't listed. Since the affiliation isn't provided, I'll leave it null for both.

The conference is NICAR 2017, so the year will be 2017. The title of the tipsheet is "User Testing Tip Sheet." For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet covers in-house and long-term user testing processes, so I'll phrase that into a simple sentence.

Keywords are next. I should pick up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Relevant keywords from the document are "user testing," "usability testing," "interview guide," "feedback implementation," and "prototypes."

Putting it all together, I structure each part according to the keys specified. Ensuring all values are in English and correctly formatted within quotes.
