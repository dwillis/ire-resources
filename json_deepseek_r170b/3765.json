Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) tipsheet. Let me break down the requirements step by step.

First, looking at the input provided, it seems like it's from a presentation or handout discussing various free data tools used in investigative journalism. The main speaker is Kate Golden from the Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism. She presented on tools like Google Spreadsheets, Google Refine, Fusion Tables, TimeFlow, and Tableau Public.

The user has specified that the JSON should have certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The ID is given as 3765. For the authors, I need to extract details like name, email, and affiliation. Since only Kate Golden's information is provided, with her email and affiliation, I'll structure that accordingly.

Next, determining the conference. The user mentioned it could be "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Given that the content discusses investigative reporting tools and mentions Scott Walker's calendars—a topic often covered in IRE events—I can infer this is from an IRE conference. However, without a specific year noted, I'll set the year to "Not Listed".

The title isn't explicitly stated, but the main focus seems to be on free data tools, so I'll use that as the title. For the description, it should be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers various tools for handling and visualizing data in investigative journalism.

Keywords need to be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords are "Google Spreadsheets", "Google Refine", "Fusion Tables", "TimeFlow", and "Tableau Public".

I also have to ensure all values are in English and properly quoted. No made-up names or information—only what's provided.

Putting it all together, I structure the JSON with each key filled as per the instructions.
