Okay, I need to create a JSON object from the provided tipsheet. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the id is given as 3429, so that's straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors section. There are several panelists listed: Stephen Stock, Megan Chuchmach, Raney Aronson, and Lawan Williams. Each has their name, email, and affiliation provided. I'll list them with these details. I notice one of the entries just says "(Moderator)" after Lawan's name, so I think that's part of her role but doesn't count as a separate author.

The conference is mentioned at the end as "IRE", so that should be the value for conference.

The year isn't explicitly stated in the text. There are dates like 9287121, but those seem to be part of URLs and not the event year. So I'll set year to "Not Listed".

For the title, it's clearly listed at the top as "On the Web/On the Air".

The description needs to summarize the content in 1-2 sentences. The tipsheet talks about integrating digital tools into investigative journalism, including examples and panelist expertise.

Keywords should be relevant and up to five terms. I'll extract important themes like investigative journalism, digital storytelling, data-driven reporting, online tools, and multimedia integration.

Putting it all together, I structure the JSON with these values, ensuring each key is properly quoted and formatted.
