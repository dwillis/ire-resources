Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. The input provided is from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet about investigating shale booms, specifically focusing on oil waste spills.

First, I'll note that the id should be 3952 as specified. The title is "Investigating a GIANT shale boom," but it might need some tweaking for clarity, so I'll make sure to phrase it correctly.

Looking at the authors section, Mark Collette is listed with his email and affiliation from the Corpus Christi Caller Times. Since there's no other author mentioned, the list will only include him.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, and the year is 2012, which is provided in the input.

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about oil waste spills and their environmental impact, so I'll mention that along with actions taken by officials.

Keywords should be relevant and limited to five. I'll choose "oil waste," "environmental investigation," "Eagle Ford Shale," "regulatory enforcement," and "shale boom" as they capture the essence of the content without overlapping with conference or author details.

I must ensure all keys are in English and properly quoted, avoiding any markdown formatting. Let me structure this step by step to make sure nothing is missed.
