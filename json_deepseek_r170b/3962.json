Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Julian Sher's presentation at an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down each step carefully.

First, the id is given as 3962, so that's straightforward. Next, looking for authors. The main author mentioned is Julian Sher, with his email jsher@thestar.ca and affiliation Toronto Star. There are no other authors listed, so the authors array will have just one entry.

The conference is IRE since it's from an IRE conference tipsheet. The year isn't explicitly stated in the text, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed". 

For the title, the slide mentions "Writing the investigative story" with an asterisk, but to make it clean, I'll use "Writing the Investigative Story".

The description should be a concise summary of the tipsheet. It focuses on storytelling techniques for investigative journalism, so I'll phrase it as advice on turning complex investigations into compelling stories using narrative elements.

Keywords are next. From the content, key terms include storytelling, investigative reporting, narrative structure, and the 4 Cs (Character, Context, Conflict, Conclusion). That makes four relevant keywords.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. No markdown, just plain JSON with each key as specified.
