Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided specific instructions with keys like id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, looking at the content, the id is 5466 as specified. The title seems to be "The Stanford Open Policing Project" presented by Sharad Goel from Stanford University.

For authors, there's a list of names: Emma Pierson, Camelia Simoiu, Jan Overgoor, Sam Corbett-Davies, Vignesh Ramachandran, Allison McCartney, James Gordon, Cheryl Phillips, and Sharad Goel. Since emails aren't provided, I'll set them to null. Affiliations are only clear for Sharad, who's with Stanford, so others will be null unless stated otherwise.

The conference is IRE as per the user instruction. The year isn't mentioned, so it should be "Not Listed". 

The description needs a concise summary. The project collects police stop data and analyzes it to test for discrimination through search rates and thresholds. So, a 1-2 sentence summary would capture that.

Keywords are up to five terms. The main points are policing, data collection, discrimination testing, statistical methods, and police stops. I'll choose these as keywords.

Putting it all together, the JSON should have all keys with proper values enclosed in quotes.
