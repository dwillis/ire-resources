Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference about Dicar and how they improve access to data and documents. They want me to create a JSON object with specific keys.

First, I'll need to extract the relevant information. The title is "How Dicar works for changing and improving access to data and documents." The author is Henriette Schjøth, but there's no email or affiliation provided, so those fields will be null.

Next, the conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's straightforward. Since the year isn't mentioned in the text, I'll set it to "Not Listed."

For the description, I need a concise summary. Dicar works on four levels: observer, applicant, educator, and adviser. They focus on improving access through monitoring, legal actions, training journalists, and advising authorities.

Keywords should be no more than five. The main terms here are "Dicar," "access to data," "FOIA," "transparency," and "computer-assisted reporting."

I'll structure all this into the required JSON format, making sure each key is properly quoted and the values match the specifications.
