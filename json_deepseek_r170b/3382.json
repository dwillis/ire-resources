Alright, so I'm looking at this query where someone wants me to create a JSON object from a tipsheet provided by Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE). The user has given specific instructions on how to structure the JSON with keys like id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. 

First, I need to parse the input carefully. The tipsheet is about using data to cover the financial crisis, presented by Wendell Cochran at an IRE National Conference in June 2010. So, the id is 3382 as given.

Next, for the authors section, there's only one author mentioned, Wendell Cochran. Since his email and affiliation aren't provided, those fields should be null. But since he's from Investigative Reporting Workshop, that becomes his affiliation.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE National Conference, so the conference key will be "IRE". The year is 2010, which is explicitly mentioned in the tipsheet. 

The title of the tipsheet is "Following the money" and the description needs to be a concise summary. I'll write it as a 1-2 sentence overview focusing on using financial data for investigative reporting.

For keywords, I need to extract relevant terms without including the conference or authors. The main topics are banking data, FDIC, financial crisis, so those will be the keywords, making sure not to exceed five terms.

I should ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, any missing information like email is set to null as per instructions.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, making sure each key is correctly assigned with the right data. This way, the response meets all specified requirements.
