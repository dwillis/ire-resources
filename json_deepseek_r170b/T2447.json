Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I'll start by identifying the required fields: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

The ID is straightforward; it's given as T2447.

Next, for the authors section, I see that Peter Panepento is listed with his contact information. His name is provided, so I can include that. His email is peter.panepento@timesnews.com, and his affiliation is Erie Times-News, which is mentioned right after his phone number. So, the authors array will have one object with all these details filled in.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE Annual Conference," so the conference field should be "IRE".

Looking at the date provided, it's Saturday, June 4, but the year isn't explicitly mentioned. Since there's no year listed, I'll set the year to "Not Listed".

The title of the session is "Investigating property scams". That seems clear and concise.

For the description, I need a 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. The tipsheet talks about uncovering a land speculation scheme involving Erieâ€™s mayor using various public records. So, summarizing that should cover it.

Now, the keywords. I have to pick up to five relevant terms excluding the conference and authors' names. Looking at the content, "property scams", "public records", "real estate investigations", "land speculation", and "financial disclosure" seem appropriate.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, the JSON structure should be correct without any markdown formatting as per the user's request.

Double-checking everything: ID is T2447, authors have Peter with his email and affiliation, conference is IRE, year is Not Listed, title is accurate, description is concise, and keywords are relevant. Everything seems in order.
