Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's instructions. The input provided is about tracking 527 committees from an IRE conference handout.

First, I'll start by identifying each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

The id should be "T2026" as specified.

Next, for authors, the text mentions Derek Willis from the Center for Public Integrity. There's no email listed, so that will be null. Affiliation is clear from his mention with the organization. So the authors list has one entry with name, null email, and affiliation.

Conference is NICAR since the input says NICAR 2004.

Year is 2004, extracted directly from the text.

Title is "Tracking 527 Committees".

Description needs to be a concise summary. The main point is about understanding and analyzing 527 committees' financial activities, so I'll phrase it as a 1-2 sentence overview.

Keywords should include terms like "527 committees", "political organizations", "IRS filings", etc., but limited to five and excluding the conference or authors. So selecting relevant terms that capture the essence without overlap.

Putting it all together, ensuring proper formatting with quotes and correct data types.
