Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's instructions. Let me start by understanding what they're asking for. They provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference and want it converted into a specific JSON format with certain keys.

First, I'll note that the id should be "T2620". That's straightforward. Next, the authors section is a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. In the original text, Janet Roberts from The New York Times is listed with her email. So, I'll include her details accordingly.

The conference is mentioned as the 2006 IRE CAR Conference in Newark, N.J., so the conference key will be "IRE" and the year is 2006. The title of the tipsheet seems to be about resources for analyzing criminal sentencing trends. 

For the description, I need a concise summary of one or two sentences. It should explain that the tipsheet provides various resources from the Bureau of Justice Statistics and other programs for analyzing data on sentencing.

Keywords are next. They should be no more than five terms, excluding the conference and authors. The relevant keywords here would include "criminal sentencing trends", "Bureau of Justice Statistics", "National Archive of Criminal Justice Data", "National Corrections Reporting Program", and "sentencing statistics".

I also need to ensure that all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. I'll structure each part carefully, making sure not to miss any details like the email or correct URLs from the original text.

Putting it all together now, I'll map each piece of information into its respective key in the JSON object. Double-checking everything for accuracy before finalizing.
