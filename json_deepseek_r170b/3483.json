Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE). Let me break down the information step by step.

First, I see the ID is clearly listed as #3483, so that's straightforward for the "id" field. Next, looking at the authors section, Rick Brooks is the only author mentioned. His email is provided as rick.brooks@wsj.com and his affiliation is The Wall Street Journal since he's the Deputy Editor there.

The conference name isn't explicitly stated in the tipsheet, but I know that IRE hosts conferences, so "conference" should be "IRE". The year is given as 2011, which will go into the "year" field. 

For the title, it says "Tracking the Economy and Business," which seems appropriate. Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet provides various data sources for economic tracking at state and local levels, so I'll mention that.

Keywords should include relevant terms like "economic data", "municipal finance", "pensions", "business reporting", and "financial crisis". These capture the main topics covered.

I need to ensure all fields are enclosed in quotes and that the structure is correct. Also, since there's only one author, the authors list will have just one object with Rick Brooks' details.
