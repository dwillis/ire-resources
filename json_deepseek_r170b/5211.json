Okay, so I need to create a JSON object from the given input. The user has provided specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, looking at the input: it's about a tipsheet titled "Schools, Disabilities and Abuse: Documents & Sources" by Heather Vogell from ProPublica. Her contact info is there too.

The id needs to be 5211. Got that. For authors, I need a list of objects with name, email, affiliation. Since only Heather Vogell is listed, others are null. Email is heather.vogell@propublica.org and her affiliation is ProPublica.

Conference: The input doesn't specify if it's from IRE or NICAR, so I'll set conference to "Not Listed". Year isn't mentioned either, so that will also be "Not Listed".

Title should exactly match the given one. Description needs a concise summaryâ€”maybe something about investigating abuse and disabilities in schools using documents and sources.

Keywords: Restraints, Disabilities, Abuse, Schools, ProPublica. That's five terms, excluding conference and authors as instructed.

Now, putting it all together into JSON structure with proper syntax.

Here is the JSON object based on your input:

```json
{
  "id": 5211,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Heather Vogell",
      "email": "heather.vogell@propublica.org",
      "affiliation": "ProPublica"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Schools, Disabilities and Abuse: Documents & Sources",
  "description": "A tipsheet on investigating restraints, disabilities, and abuse in schools, including sources for finding students, data resources, and relevant documents.",
  "keywords": ["Restraints", "Disabilities", "Abuse", "Schools", "ProPublica"]
}
```
