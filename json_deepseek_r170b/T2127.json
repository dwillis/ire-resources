Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an IRE conference. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the id is given as T2127. That's straightforward.

Next, the authors section requires each author's name, email, and affiliation. The text mentions Margot Williams from The Washington Post and Richard Drezden, but there's no contact information for either. So their emails will be null, and Margot's affiliation is The Washington Post since that's listed next to her name.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE in Atlanta, June 2004, so the conference key is "IRE" and the year is 2004.

For the title, it's "Using the Web to Background Business." That makes sense.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet focuses on online tools for investigating businesses, so I'll write that it provides tips and resources for using web tools in business investigations.

Keywords are up to five terms. The main points include company research, SEC filings, bankruptcy courts, online databases, and investigative journalism. That covers the key areas discussed.

I need to make sure all values are enclosed in quotes and the structure is correct without any markdown. Let me put it all together ensuring each part fits into the JSON format properly.
