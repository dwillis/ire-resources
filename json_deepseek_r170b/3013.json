Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through the input step by step.

First, I'll identify each required field for the JSON object: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

The id is given as 3013, so that's straightforward.

Looking at the authors section, there are two people listed: Doug Pardue from The Post & Courier and Mary Fricker from the Press Democrat. I'll need to extract their names, emails, and affiliations. For each author, if an affiliation isn't explicitly mentioned next to their name, I should use the news organization they're associated with.

Next, the conference is clearly stated as "IRE" since it's an IRE Watchdog Journalism Workshop in Las Vegas, Nevada, on September 17-18, 2007. So the year is 2007.

The title of the tipsheet seems to be "Dealing with Ethics, Anonymous Sources and the Public."

For the description, I'll need a concise summary. The content covers handling ethics cases, anonymous sources, and public interactions in journalism. It includes specific examples like government cooperation, offensive images, sting operations, and source policies.

Keywords should be up to five terms. From the topics, I can extract "ethics," "anonymous sources," "media bias," "journalism ethics," and "source policies."

I also need to ensure that all values are in English and properly quoted. Any missing information like email or affiliation should be set to null.

Now, putting it all together, each part is filled out based on the input without adding any made-up data.
