Alright, so I'm trying to create a JSON object based on this tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided specific instructions, so I need to make sure I follow them carefully.

First, the ID should be "5647_1". That's straightforward. Next, the authors section is a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. Since the tipsheet doesn't mention any specific authors, I'll set each author's name to null. Email and affiliation can also be null as there's no information provided.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE" since it's from Investigative Reporters and Editors. The year isn't given in the text, so I'll put "Not Listed". 

For the title, it's "Under Pressure: Tipsheet for Breaking News and Daily Turns." The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet offers strategies for handling breaking news, emphasizing preparation, context, and using data effectively.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords are "breaking news," "data journalism," "investigative reporting," "newsroom strategies," and "journalism best practices."

I'll structure all this into a JSON object, ensuring each key is in quotes and values are correctly formatted. I need to double-check that there are no markdown elements and that everything is properly enclosed within quotes.

    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
