Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on this tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The input provided includes various slides and notes about "robot reporters" or automated journalism tools.

First, I'll break down the components required for the JSON:

- **id**: This should be a unique identifier. Looking at the title of the tipsheet, I can create an id like "assistedreportingHowtocreaterobotreportersinyourownimage".

- **authors**: The text doesn't mention specific authors by name. It includes a photo credit to ThomasHawk and an artist's name, Mark S. Fisher, but these are likely not the authors of the tipsheet itself. Since there's no explicit author mentioned, I'll set "name" to null, and both "email" and "affiliation" can also be null.

- **conference**: The tipsheet mentions URLs with "lat.ms", which is associated with the Los Angeles Times. However, the conference itself is about investigative reporters, so it's likely an IRE event. Thus, I'll set this to "IRE".

- **year**: There’s no specific year provided in the text, so I’ll mark it as "Not Listed".

- **title**: The main title seems to be "How to create robot reporters in your own image".

- **description**: This should be a brief summary. From the content, the tipsheet talks about creating automated reporting tools for journalism, like setting up data streams and alerts.

- **keywords**: I need up to five relevant terms. The text mentions topics like automation, data analysis, newsroom tools, election results, SEC filings, home sales, etc. So keywords could be "automation", "data analysis", "newsroom tools", "election results", and "SEC filings".

Putting it all together, the JSON should have each key filled appropriately with the information parsed from the tipsheet.
