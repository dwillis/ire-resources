Okay, so I need to create a JSON object from the given input. The user has provided some notes about an investigative report by Alan Cohn regarding defective parts on Blackhawk helicopters. Let me break down the steps.

First, the structure of the JSON should have keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The ID is 3129 as specified.

Looking at the input, I see that Alan Cohn is mentioned multiple times with his affiliation as WTNH-TV New Haven and News Channel 8. So under authors, I'll create a list where each element has name, email, and affiliation. Since there's no email provided, it will be null for both entries.

The conference isn't explicitly stated in the text, so I should set it to "Not Listed". The year is also not mentioned, so that will be "Not Listed" as well.

For the title, the main topic is about defective parts on Blackhawk helicopters, so that's straightforward. 

The description needs to be a concise summary. It should mention Alan Cohn's investigation and how sources revealed defective parts leading to safety concerns. 

Keywords are up to five terms. From the content, "Defective Parts", "Blackhawk Helicopters", "Sikorsky", "DOD", and "FOIA" seem relevant.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part accordingly ensuring that all values are in English and properly quoted.

    {
      "name": null,

    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Defective Parts on Blackhawk Helicopters",
  "description": "Alan Cohn's investigation reveals defective parts installed on Blackhawk helicopters, citing sources and documentation.",
  "keywords": ["Defective Parts", "Blackhawk Helicopters", "Sikorsky", "DOD", "FOIA"]
}
```
