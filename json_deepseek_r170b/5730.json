Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, the id is straightforwardâ€”it's 5730 as specified.

Next, for authors, I see multiple presenters mentioned: Katie Townsend, Matt Pearce, and Kelly Hinchcliffe. Each author entry needs a name, email, and affiliation. Since emails aren't provided, they'll be null. Affiliations are based on their roles or the news organizations they're part of. For example, Katie is with RCFP, so her affiliation is "Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press". Matt is from Los Angeles Times, so that's his affiliation. Kelly works at WRAL and MuckRock, so I'll list both.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE18, which stands for Investigative Reporters and Editors, 2018. So the conference key will be "IRE" and the year is 2018.

The title of the tipsheet seems to be about covering protests and mayhem, perhaps titled "Covering Protests and Other Assorted Mayhem".

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet offers advice on preparing for protests, staying safe, dealing with police, using social media, and accessing records. So the description should encapsulate that.

Keywords are to be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. So terms like "protest coverage", "journalist safety", "police interactions", "social media monitoring", and "public records" seem appropriate.

I need to ensure all keys are in English, enclosed in quotes, and the JSON structure is correct without any markdown.
