Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query and the provided data. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, the user provided a tipsheet from an IRE conference. The main speaker is Andy Lehren from NBC News Investigations. He presented at the IRE Watchdog Workshop in May 2019 at Columbia Journalism School.

The JSON structure needs specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id should be "5660_2". 

For the authors, it's a list where each element has name, email, and affiliation. Since only Andy Lehren is mentioned, his entry will have his name, null for email, and NBC News Investigations as his affiliation.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's straightforward. The year is 2019 according to the data. 

The title of the tipsheet seems to be about using local data for investigations, so I'll go with "Using Local Data for Investigative Reporting."

Description needs a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about finding and analyzing local data, so I'll mention that it provides strategies for identifying and using local data sources for storytelling.

Keywords should include terms like local data, investigative reporting, government records, public spending, whistleblowers, and transparency. But since the user wants no more than five, I'll pick the top five: local data, investigative reporting, government records, public spending, whistleblowers.

Putting it all together, I structure each key with appropriate values, ensuring everything is in English and properly quoted as per JSON standards.
