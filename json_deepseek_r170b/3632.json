Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors conference. Let me see how to approach this step by step.

First, the user's query specifies that the response should only be a JSON object with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 3632.

Looking at the input, it starts with "Mining Data Around The Globe" and mentions Andy Lehren from The New York Times. So, the author's name should be Andy Lehren. Since his affiliation isn't explicitly mentioned next to his name but he's part of a session led by The New York Times, I can use that as his affiliation.

The conference is NICAR â€“ St. Louis 2012, so the conference key will be "NICAR" and the year is clearly listed as 2012.

For the title, it seems to be "Mining Data Around The Globe." 

The description should be a concise summary of the text. The tipsheet covers various data sources for international investigations, like lead battery recycling in Mexico, pharmaceutical ingredients from China, and Olympic athlete nationality issues. So I can summarize this as an exploration of using global data sources.

Keywords are next. I need up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords could be "data journalism," "international reporting," "environmental investigations," "pharmaceutical safety," and "Olympic athletes."

Now, putting it all together in JSON format. I'll make sure each key is enclosed in quotes, and the structure follows the requirements without any markdown.

I think that's about it. Let me check if I missed anything: id is 3632, authors list with Andy Lehren, conference NICAR, year 2012, title correct, description covers the main points, keywords are relevant and within the limit.
