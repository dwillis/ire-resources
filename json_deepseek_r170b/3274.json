Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id should be 3274 as specified. Then, for authors, there's Ismael Estrada from CNN AC360 with his contact info. So I'll set up an array with one author object containing name, email, and affiliation. 

Next, conference is clearly IRE because it's the IRE 2009 National Conference. The year is 2009 since it's provided in the text.

The title is given as "Broadcast: Staying on the Air - Staying Relevant." For description, I need a concise summary. Looking at the content, it focuses on strategies for journalists during breaking news and beyond, so I'll craft a two-sentence summary highlighting those aspects.

Keywords should be relevant terms from the text. Breaking news, investigative journalism, storytelling, media relevance, and urgency stand out as key themes.

I have to ensure all keys are in quotes and that no values are made up. Also, since the conference is IRE, that's covered, and all other fields need proper formatting. No markdown, just plain JSON with English strings.
