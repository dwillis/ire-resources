Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, looking at the input, it's about a session titled "Killers Among Heroes" presented by Doug Stanley at the 2006 NICAR National Conference in Newark. The session is part of the "Revealing Stories from Veterans Data" track. 

The id should be T2641 as specified. Next, I need to handle the authors. Doug Stanley's name is provided along with his email and affiliation (The Tampa Tribune). So the authors list will have one entry with his details.

For the conference field, since it's NICAR, that goes in straightforwardly. The year is clearly 2006. The title is "Killers Among Heroes."

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary of what the session is about. From the text, it seems Stanley discussed using data to uncover if murderers were buried in national cemeteries and shared methods like scraping cemetery records and FOIA requests.

Keywords should be relevant terms excluding conference names or authors. So I'll go with "veterans", "cemeteries", "data journalism", "FOIA", and "investigative reporting".

I have to make sure all keys are in quotes, values are properly formatted, and there's no markdown involved. Also, avoid making up any information not present.

Putting it all together, the JSON structure should look clean with each key properly assigned based on the provided content.
