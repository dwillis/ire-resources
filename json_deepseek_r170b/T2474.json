Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given input. The user provided a query that includes various notes from an investigative reporter's conference or something similar. Let me break down what I need to do step by step.

First, the id is T2474, which is straightforward. Next, authors: looking through the text, there are no specific names mentioned. So each author entry in the list will have name as null, and since email and affiliation aren't provided either, they'll also be null.

The conference is next. The user's input mentions IRE and NICAR, but I need to check if it's explicitly stated which one this text belongs to. From what I can see, there's no clear mention of the conference name, so I'll set it to "Not Listed". 

For the year, again, I don't see any specific year mentioned in the provided text, so that will also be "Not Listed".

The title should capture the essence of the content. The notes are about investigative techniques and strategies for journalists, so a suitable title would be something like "Investigative Reporting Techniques and Strategies."

The description needs to be a concise summary. Since the text covers various tactics for gathering information and dealing with sources, I'll phrase it as: "Notes on various investigative reporting techniques and strategies for gathering information and dealing with sources."

Now, keywords. The main topics are investigative journalism, so keywords like "investigative journalism", "reporting techniques", "source management", "interview strategies" make sense. I need to limit this to five terms, but looking at the content, these seem appropriate.

Putting it all together, each field should be enclosed in quotes and properly formatted as JSON. No markdown, just plain JSON with correct syntax.

Wait, let me double-check if there's any mention of authors or conference details that I missed. Skimming through again, nope, nothing specific. So my initial assessment stands.

```json
{
  "id": "T2474",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigative Reporting Techniques and Strategies",
  "description": "Notes on various investigative reporting techniques and strategies for gathering information and dealing with sources.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative journalism",
    "reporting techniques",
    "source management",
    "interview strategies"
  ]
}
```
