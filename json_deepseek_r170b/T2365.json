Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. Let me read through their instructions carefully.

First, they want the JSON to have specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is set as T2365. 

Looking at the input text, it seems to be about the advantages of social network analysis in journalism, especially for investigative purposes. There are mentions of various applications like local government power, campaign contributions, crime, public health, etc.

Now, for the authors section: I don't see any specific author names mentioned in the text. So, each element in the authors list should have name as null. The email and affiliation can also be null since there's no information provided about them.

The conference key needs to be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Since the document discusses IRE's social network analysis page, it's safe to classify this under the "IRE" conference.

As for the year, the text doesn't specify when the event took place. So, I'll set year as "Not Listed".

The title should reflect the main topic. The input is about using social network analysis in investigative journalism, so a suitable title would be something like "Using Social Network Analysis in Investigative Journalism."

For the description, it needs to be a concise summary of 1-2 sentences. I'll summarize that the text discusses how journalists can apply social network analysis to investigate various issues by mapping connections between individuals and organizations.

Keywords are limited to five terms, excluding conference names and authors. The relevant keywords here would include "investigative journalism," "social network analysis," "local government," "campaign contributions," and "public health."

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring each key is correctly populated with the right values based on the input text.

    }
  ],

  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Using Social Network Analysis in Investigative Journalism",
  "description": "This document discusses the application of social network analysis in investigative journalism, providing examples and methods for tracking connections between individuals and organizations.
