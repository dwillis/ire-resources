Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me start by carefully reading through the material.

First, the title of the session is "Managing the Tipline," which took place at the IRE National Conference in 2002. The speaker is Matt Goldberg from KCBS-TV, and his email is provided as matt@tvinvestigators.com.

The tipsheet discusses different methods for managing a tipline, including using text files, spreadsheet programs like Excel, database software such as MS Access, and even online databases. It highlights the benefits of each method, like ease of use, search functionality, and scalability based on the volume of tips received.

Now, I need to structure this information into a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. 

The ID is given as T1651. The authors section should be an array. Matt Goldberg is listed, but there are no other authors mentioned, so the array will have one element. His name is provided, email is matt@tvinvestigators.com, and his affiliation is KCBS-TV.

The conference is IRE National Conference 2002, so the "conference" key will be "IRE". The year is clearly stated as 2002. The title is straightforward: "Managing the Tipline."

For the description, it should be a concise summary in simple language. The tipsheet talks about different methods to manage tips, so I'll mention text files and database software like MS Access.

Keywords need to be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Relevant keywords would be "tipline management," "database software," "text files," "MS Access," and "story ideas."

Putting it all together, each key should have the appropriate values, ensuring all strings are in English and properly enclosed in quotes.
