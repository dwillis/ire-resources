Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, I'll start by identifying each piece of information needed for these keys. The ID is straightforwardâ€”it's given as T2651. 

Next, the authors section requires a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. In the provided text, Nils Mulvad is listed with his email and affiliation as Dicar. There are no other authors mentioned, so the list will only include him.

For the conference field, since the panel was part of an IRE event in Newark, the conference should be "IRE". The year is specified as 2006 because the panel took place on March 9th, 2006.

The title of the tipsheet seems to be "Latest in scraping from Denmark" based on the header. 

The description needs to be a concise summary of the text. It mentions using software like Robosuite for web scraping and various applications such as tracking house sales and election results. So, I'll craft a 1-2 sentence summary that captures the essence without getting too detailed.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Relevant keywords here are "web scraping", "data journalism", "Denmark", "Robosuite", and "public data".

I need to ensure all values are in English, which they already are, and that each key is properly quoted. The structure needs to follow JSON syntax correctly without any markdown.

Let me double-check if I missed anything. The user also mentioned not making up names and handling cases where information isn't provided. Since everything needed is present, no nulls except for potential edges like other authors which aren't applicable here.

Alright, time to put it all together into the JSON format as specified.

    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
