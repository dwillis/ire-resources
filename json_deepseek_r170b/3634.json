Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conferences. The user has given me specific instructions with several key points that I need to address carefully.

First, looking at the structure they want: id is fixed as 3634. That's straightforward. Next, authors should be a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. They emphasized not making up any names and leaving name as null if it's not provided. From the document, I see Charlie Szymanski and Tyler Dukes are mentioned with their emails and affiliations. So I can fill those in without issues.

The conference is either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Since this tipsheet mentions the Reporters' Lab at Duke University's Center for Media and Democracy, it's likely part of an IRE conference. The year isn't explicitly stated here, so it should be "Not Listed".

For the title, the main tools discussed are TimeFlow and Video Notebook, but looking deeper, the tipsheet covers both with a focus on tools for reporting. So a general title like "Tools for Investigative Reporting" makes sense.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The document talks about two tools: TimeFlow for organizing historical data and Video Notebook for managing recorded meetings. I can condense this into one or two sentences highlighting both tools' purposes without getting too technical.

Keywords should exclude the conference and authors, so terms like "investigative journalism", "data analysis", "reporting tools", "open source software", and "public records" are relevant here.

I also need to ensure that all keys and values are in English and enclosed in quotes. No markdown, just plain JSON. I'll structure it accordingly, making sure the syntax is correct with proper commas and braces.

Now, putting it all together step by step:

1. Start with id: 3634.
2. Authors list includes Charlie and Tyler with their details.
3. Conference set to "IRE".
4. Year remains "Not Listed" since not provided.
5. Title captures the essence of the tipsheet content.
6. Description is a brief summary of both tools mentioned.
7. Keywords are relevant terms up to five, excluding conference and authors.

Double-checking each part to ensure compliance with user instructions, especially about not making up names and correctly assigning affiliations based on provided info. I think this covers everything needed without missing any key points.
