Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let's break down the requirements step by step.

First, the structure of the JSON should have specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The ID is given as 5431, so that's straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors section. There's only one author mentioned: Christopher Schnaars from USA TODAY. His email and Twitter handle are provided, but since the JSON structure expects name, email, and affiliation, I'll include those. Affiliation will be "USA TODAY" as that's his employer.

For the conference, it's listed as an IRE event, so that key is set to "IRE". The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the input, so according to instructions, it should be "Not Listed".

The title of the tipsheet is clear: "Finding Data to Cover College Athletics".

Now, the description needs to be a concise 1-2 sentence summary. I'll focus on the main points about using NCAA financial reports and coach contracts for investigative stories.

Keywords should be up to five terms related to the content but excluding the conference name and authors. From the tipsheet, relevant keywords are "college athletics", "NCAA financial reports", "coach contracts", "athletic spending", and "FOIA requests".

I'll make sure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes without any markdown formatting.

Double-checking each field to ensure accuracy: ID is correct, authors have the right details, conference is IRE, year remains not listed, title matches, description is concise, and keywords are relevant and limited to five.

Looks like everything's covered. Time to assemble the JSON.

      "name": "Christopher Schnaars",
      "email": "cschnaars@usatoday.com",
      "affiliation": "USA TODAY"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Finding Data to Cover College Athletics",
  "description": "This tipsheet provides guidance on using NCAA financial reports and coach contracts to investigate college athletics, focusing on revenue, expenses, salaries, and perks.",
  "keywords": [
    "college athletics",
    "NCAA financial reports",
    "coach contracts",
    "athletic spending",
