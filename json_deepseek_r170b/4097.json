Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The input provided includes details about an NPR app template repository on GitHub.

First, I'll start by identifying each required key for the JSON: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The id is given as 4097, so that's straightforward.

Next, for authors, I see that the text mentions "nprapps" as the organization. However, no specific author names are provided. The instructions say to leave the name null if none is listed and use the news organization as the affiliation. So each author entry will have name as null, email as null, and affiliation as "NPR".

The conference is IRE because that's where this tipsheet was presented.

Looking for the year, the text doesn't specify a particular event year, so it defaults to "Not Listed".

The title should be something descriptive of the repository. Looking at the GitHub page, it mentions "nprviz's Project Template", which seems appropriate as the title.

For the description, I need a concise summary in simple terms. The repository is an opinionated project template for client-side apps with features like data rendering and deployment to S3. So I'll craft a 1-2 sentence summary capturing that.

Keywords should be up to five relevant terms excluding conference and authors. From the text, "project template", "client-side app", "data rendering", "deployment", and "S3" are suitable keywords.

Putting it all together, ensuring all keys are in quotes and proper formatting.

```json

  "id": 4097,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "NPR"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "nprviz's Project Template",
  "description": "A project template for client-side apps with features like data rendering, LESS compilation, and S3 deployment.",
  "keywords": [
    "project template",
    "client-side app",
    "data rendering",
    "deployment",
    "S3"
  ]
}
```
