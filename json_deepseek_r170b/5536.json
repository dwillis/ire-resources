Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, I see that the id should be 5536 as per the instructions. That's straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors section. The document mentions Julia O’Donoghue with her email and phone number. Her affiliation isn't explicitly stated next to her name, but since she's writing for a statehouse reporting tipsheet, I can infer that her affiliation is likely "The Times-Picayune" or another news organization. However, the provided text doesn't specify her affiliation, so I might have to leave it as null unless instructed otherwise.

Wait, in the user's example response, Julia O’Donoghue has an affiliation of "NOLA.com". Looking back at the input, her email is jodonoghue@nola.com, which suggests that NOLA.com is her affiliation. So, I should include that in the authors' list as her affiliation.

Now, moving on to the conference details. The tipsheet is from an IRE conference, so the conference key will be "IRE". The year is clearly listed as September 15, 2018, so the year value is 2018.

The title of the tipsheet is "Statehouse Reporting", which is explicitly mentioned at the top. 

For the description, it needs to be a concise summary in simple language. The document covers four key areas: legislation, budget, policy effects, and corruption. So I can summarize that the tipsheet provides strategies for investigating state government activities.

Keywords are next. I need up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords could be "statehouse reporting", "legislation", "budget", "public policy", and "corruption". These capture the main areas covered in the document.

Putting it all together, each key should have its respective value, making sure that strings are enclosed in quotes and that the structure is correct. I need to ensure that authors are a list with each author having name, email, and affiliation. Since only Julia O’Donoghue is listed, she'll be the sole entry.

I think I've covered all the necessary parts without missing any details. Now, let me format this into proper JSON.

```json

    {
      "name": "Julia O'Donoghue",
      "email": "jodonoghue@nola.com",
      "affiliation": "NOLA.com"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2018,
  "title": "Statehouse Reporting",
  "description": "A tipsheet providing strategies for investigating state government activities, including legislation, budget, policy effects, and corruption.",
  "keywords": [
    "statehouse reporting",
    "legislation",
    "budget",
    "public policy",
    "corruption"
