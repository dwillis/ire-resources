Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from the IRE Conference. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, the id is specified as 3515. That's straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors: Jim Steele, Mike McGraw, and Joe Stephens. Their emails and affiliations are provided. So for each author, I'll create an object with name, email, and affiliation. The affiliations are their respective news organizations since that's listed next to their names.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE" in Orlando from June 2011, so the year will be 2011. 

For the title, it seems to be "Unsung Documents." That makes sense as the header of the tipsheet.

The description needs to be a concise summary. I'll mention that the tipsheet highlights how to find and use lesser-known documents in investigative journalism.

Keywords should include terms like "investigative journalism," "FOIA," and other relevant topics without listing the conference or authors. I'll choose five key terms from the content provided.

I need to ensure all values are in English, enclosed in quotes, and that the JSON structure is correct with proper commas and brackets.
