Okay, so I've got this QGIS guide that someone wrote, and now they want me to create a JSON object based on it. Hmm, let's see what exactly they need.

First, the JSON should have specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as "followalonginstructions". Got it. 

Now, for the authors section, I need to list them with name, email, and affiliation. But wait, in the original text, there are no authors mentioned. So each author entry should have name as null since none are provided. Email and affiliation can also be null because there's no info.

Next up is conference. The options are "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Since this guide doesn't mention any conference, it should be "Not Listed".

Year is another field. Looking at the text, I don't see a specific year mentioned, so that'll also be "Not Listed".

Title isn't provided either, so I need to come up with one based on the content. Something like "QGIS Mapping Guide" seems appropriate.

Description needs to be a short summary. The guide teaches mapping in QGIS, covering both shapefiles and point data styling. I should keep it simple and concise, maybe two sentences.

Keywords are next. They shouldn't include the conference or authors but should capture the main topics. So terms like "QGIS", "Mapping", "Spatial Analysis", "Data Visualization" fit well, keeping it to five.

I also have to make sure all values are in English unless the original isn't, which they are here. All keys and values must be in quotes as per JSON standards.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part carefully, making sure not to miss any fields or add extra info beyond what's provided.

```json
{
  "id": "followalonginstructions",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "QGIS Mapping Guide",
  "description": "A guide on using QGIS for mapping, covering shapefiles and point data styling.",
  "keywords": [
    "QGIS",
    "Mapping",
    "Spatial Analysis",
    "Data Visualization"
  ]
}
```
