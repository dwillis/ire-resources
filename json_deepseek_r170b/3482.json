Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let's break down the task step by step.

First, the user provided specific instructions. The JSON should have keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. 

Starting with the id, it's given as 3482, so that's straightforward.

Next, for authors, I see Chris Roush is listed. His name is provided, along with his email and affiliation. So each author entry should have name, email, and affiliation. Since only one author is present, the list will contain just this one object.

The conference is mentioned as the 2011 CAR Conference in Raleigh, N.C., but CAR stands for Computer-Assisted Reporting, which I believe falls under IRE's umbrella. So the conference key should be "IRE".

The year is clearly stated as 2011, so that goes into the year field.

For the title, it's "Tracking the Economy and Business", which is a direct heading from the tipsheet.

The description needs to be a concise summary of the content. The tipsheet provides various online resources for investigating economic and business topics. So I'll phrase it as a 1-2 sentence overview of that.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords are "economy", "business", "investigative reporting", "online resources", and "data journalism".

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part accordingly, ensuring all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes.

I also need to make sure that if any information isn't present, like other authors or specific details, they're set to null. But in this case, we have sufficient data for each required field except for additional authors beyond Chris Roush.

Double-checking everything against the user's instructions to ensure compliance.
