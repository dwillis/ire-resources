Okay, so I'm trying to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet on covering healthcare. The user has provided specific instructions on how to structure this JSON, with keys like id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, I'll need to extract all relevant information from the given text. The title of the tipsheet is "So, you want to cover health care? Tips and strategies for tackling data, money, and stories." That seems clear enough.

Next, the authors listed are Kristen Schorsch, Nina Martin, and Liz Lucas, each affiliated with different organizations: Crainâ€™s Chicago Business, ProPublica, and Kaiser Health News respectively. I need to structure them as an array of objects with name and affiliation. Since their emails aren't provided, those fields will be null.

The conference is mentioned at the top as "Investigative Reporters and Editors," which I know is commonly referred to as IRE, so the conference key should be "IRE". The year isn't explicitly stated in the text, so according to instructions, it'll be "Not Listed".

For the description, I need a concise 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet covers strategies for using data and financial information in healthcare reporting, so I can write something like: "Tips and strategies for covering healthcare, including using federal data sources, understanding billing codes, and following financial trails."

Keywords should be up to five terms related to the content. Looking at the text, relevant keywords might include "healthcare reporting", "data journalism", "financial investigation", "CMS data", and "Medicare billing". I'll make sure these are concise and relevant.

Now, putting it all together, ensuring that all keys are in quotes and proper JSON formatting is followed. Each part should be correctly placed without any markdown as per the user's request.
