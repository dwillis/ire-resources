Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down the requirements step by step.

First, the structure should include specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as T1165, so that's straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors section. The tipsheet lists Greg Reeves and Rose Ciotta with their emails and affiliations. I need to create an array of objects for each author. Each object should have name, email, and affiliation. Since both authors are listed clearly, I can extract their details directly. Greg's affiliation is "Cox Newspapers" as mentioned in the text, but wait, looking back, actually it says "affiliation: Cox Newspapers (if none appears next to the author name)". Hmm, no, in the original input, under each author's email, there are parentheses indicating their affiliations. So Greg Reeves is affiliated with "Cox Newspapers" and Rose Ciotta with "St. Paul Pioneer Press". So I can fill those in.

The conference is specified as IRE because the tipsheet is from an IRE event. The year is clearly listed as 1999, so that goes into the year field.

The title of the tipsheet is given as "Investigating Urban Sprawl and Development", which I'll use verbatim.

For the description, I need a concise summary in 1-2 sentences. The text provides a list of data sources for investigating urban issues, so I can summarize that it's about strategies and data sources to explore urban sprawl, development, etc.

Keywords should be up to five terms. From the content, relevant keywords could be "urban sprawl", "development", "data sources", "investigative reporting", and "growth patterns". I need to ensure they're in English and exclude any mentions of the conference or authors.

Putting it all together, I structure each part accordingly, making sure all values are enclosed in quotes and the JSON syntax is correct.
