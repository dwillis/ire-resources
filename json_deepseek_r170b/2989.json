Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, let me parse through the input to extract necessary information. The ID is given as 2989, which I'll include directly. 

Looking at the authors section, there's only one author mentioned: David McKie from CBC News Investigations. His contact info includes office and cell numbers, but since the user said not to make up names and only include what's listed, I should set his name as "David McKie", email as provided, and affiliation as "CBC News Investigations". So the authors array will have one object with these details.

The conference is clearly stated as the 2007 IRE Conference, so the conference key will be "IRE" and the year is 2007. The title of the tipsheet is "Getting the Most Out of Investigative Reporting".

For the description, I need a concise summary in simple language. It should capture that the tipsheet offers strategies for maximizing impact in investigative journalism through data use and web integration.

Next, keywords. They should be no more than five terms excluding conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords might include "investigative reporting", "data-driven journalism", "web integration", "storytelling techniques", and "journalistic strategies". These terms encapsulate the main themes without overlapping with other keys.

I need to make sure all values are in English unless otherwise specified. Since everything here is in English, that's straightforward.

Now, putting it all together:

- id: 2989
- authors: Array with one object containing name, email, affiliation.
- conference: "IRE"
- year: 2007
- title: "Getting the Most Out of Investigative Reporting"
- description: A concise summary.
- keywords: The selected five terms.

I also need to ensure that all keys and string values are in quotes. No markdown, just plain JSON structure.

Double-checking for any missing or extra information. It looks like I have everything covered as per the instructions. So, time to format this into a proper JSON object.
