Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has provided specific instructions on how to structure this JSON.

First, the id should be "4108_2" as specified. 

Next, looking at the authors section, Peter Aldhous is listed with his email and Twitter handle. There's no explicit affiliation mentioned, so I'll leave that null. Since there are no other authors, the list will have only one entry.

The conference is NICAR 2014 in Baltimore, so the conference key should be "NICAR". The year is clearly given as 2014.

For the title, it's "Mapping 1: Displaying Geographical Data with QGIS". 

The description needs to be a concise summary. The session covers using QGIS for creating thematic maps and importing shapefiles, so I'll phrase that into two simple sentences.

Keywords should be relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. I'll include "QGIS", "geospatial mapping", "thematic maps", "shapefiles", and "cartography" as they're all key topics covered.

Putting it all together, I structure each part carefully to ensure all fields are correctly filled and formatted in JSON.

```json
{
  "id": "4108_2",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Peter Aldhous",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2014",
  "title": "Mapping 1: Displaying Geographical Data with QGIS",
  "description": "Learn how to create thematic maps and import geospatial data using QGIS. This session covers the basics of mapping geographical data effectively.",
  "keywords": [
    "QGIS",
    "geospatial mapping",
    "thematic maps",
    "shapefiles",
    "cartography"
  ]
}
```
