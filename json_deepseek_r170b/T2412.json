Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let's see what information I have here.

First, looking at the input, it starts with "Understanding Military Aviation" as the title. The speaker is Dick O’Reilly, who is listed as a consultant in computer-assisted reporting. The conference was the IRE Annual Conference held in Denver, CO, in 2005.

Now, breaking down the content, Dick talks about how military aircraft interact with FAA controllers and the different types of airspace they use. He outlines the phases of typical military flights, which include takeoff, enroute, aerial refueling, mission, approach, and landing. Each phase has varying workload levels, with some being high workload.

He also discusses crash rules of thumb, noting that multiple factors are usually involved and that crashes are more likely during high-workload phases. Weather conditions can exacerbate issues. He distinguishes between aircraft problems and pilot errors as common causes for crashes, depending on the flight phase.

In the event of a military plane crash, Dick lists basic questions to ask, such as whether it's a single or multiple aircraft incident, the flight phase, time of day, weather conditions, FAA contact, pilot qualifications, and aircraft condition. He advises gathering details from various sources and checking military safety center websites for statistics.

He mentions specific URLs for each branch's safety centers: Air Force, Army, Navy, Marines. Also, he refers to military safety magazines like Air Force Flying Safety Magazine, Army Flightfax, and Navy Approach magazine, which contain first-person accounts and accident information.

There's a note that his opinions are based on his experience as both a civilian pilot and journalist. At the end, there's an acronym dictionary URL provided.

Now, I need to structure this into a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

- The id is given as T2412.
- Authors should be a list of objects with name, email, affiliation. Dick O’Reilly's email and affiliation aren't provided, so they'll be null.
- Conference is IRE since it's the IRE Annual Conference.
- Year is 2005 as stated.
- Title is "Understanding Military Aviation".
- Description needs to be a concise summary: maybe something like tips for investigating military aviation crashes, covering phases, causes, and resources.
- Keywords should include up to five terms. Possible keywords could be "military aviation", "aircraft safety", "crash investigation", "FAA regulations", "flight phases".

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly quoted. Also, no markdown or extra text outside the JSON structure.

Let me put this all together now.
