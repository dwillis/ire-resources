Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's instructions. The input provided is from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet titled "Data Deep Dives: Incredible Cops" by Robert Lewis from WNYC.

First, I'll start with the id, which should be 4937 as specified. Next, the authors section requires a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. Since only Robert Lewis is mentioned, his name will be used, but there's no email provided, so it remains null. His affiliation is WNYC.

The conference is clearly IRE, so that goes in the conference field. The year isn't provided, so I'll set it to "Not Listed". 

For the title, it should exactly match the input: "Data Deep Dives: Incredible Cops".

The description needs to be a concise 1-2 sentence summary. Looking at the content, the investigation focuses on NYPD officers with credibility issues and how they remain on the force despite such problems. So I'll write something like that.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the text, key topics are police accountability, officer misconduct, criminal justice data, transparency, and public records. These seem relevant.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly quoted. Also, any missing info is set to null where necessary.
