Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The user provided specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, looking at the input, there are several sections that outline different resources for investigative journalists. Each section lists a website and describes its usefulness. For example, Municipal Advisory Councils, costreportdata.com, FDA warning letters database, etc., each with explanations on how they can be used to find story ideas or data.

The user's instructions mention that the JSON should have an id of 3094. Since no authors are listed in the text, the authors array will contain elements where name is null and email and affiliation are also null. The conference is clearly IRE because the input starts with "Investigative Reporters and Editors conferences." The year isn't provided, so it should be "Not Listed."

For the title, I think a suitable one would capture the essence of the resources listed, maybe something like "Web Resources for Investigative Reporting Tips." The description needs to be concise, summarizing that these websites provide tools for journalists to find story ideas on municipal securities, healthcare data, FDA warnings, licensing boards, and government performance.

Keywords should include terms like Municipal Securities, Healthcare Data, FDA Warnings, Licensing Boards, Government Performance. Each keyword is a main topic covered in the resources listed, keeping it to five as per instructions.

I need to make sure all keys are enclosed in quotes and the JSON is properly formatted without any markdown. No values should be made up; if information isn't present, like authors' names, they remain null.
