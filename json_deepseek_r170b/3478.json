Alright, I'm looking at this user query where they want me to create a JSON object based on some specific instructions. The input provided seems to be from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet about social media tools for journalists by Doug Haddix.

First, I need to parse the input correctly. It includes several pages with headers and content. The main points are how journalists can use social media for finding sources, getting story ideas, monitoring key figures, covering events live, engaging audiences, staying updated on news, and branding themselves and their organizations. There are also mentions of specific tools like Twellow.com, HootSuite, TrendsMap, Monitter.com, and OneForty.com.

The user wants a JSON object with keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 3478. For the authors section, it's a list where each entry has name, email, and affiliation. Since only Doug Haddix is mentioned without an email or affiliation beyond IRE, his entry will have nulls for email and his affiliation as "IRE".

The conference should be "IRE" since that's clearly stated. The year is 2011 as indicated by the copyright notice. The title is straightforward: "Social media tools for journalists". 

For the description, it needs to be a concise summary in simple language. I'll focus on how social media helps journalists find sources, monitor trends, and use specific tools.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. So I'll include social media, journalism, real-time reporting, online tools, and brand management.

I need to make sure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes without any markdown. Also, no made-up information, so where details aren't present, I leave them as null.
