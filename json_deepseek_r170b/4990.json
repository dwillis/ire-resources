Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has provided specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, looking at the input, the title of the tipsheet is "COVERING LOCAL GOVERNMENT" from an IRE Watchdog Workshop held at Stony Brook University. The author listed is Keith Herbert from Newsday, and the date is April 1, 2017.

The id should be 4990 as specified. For the authors array, each entry needs name, email, and affiliation. Since only Keith Herbert's name is provided without an email, his email will be null, and his affiliation is Newsday. So that part seems straightforward.

Next, the conference is clearly IRE since it's an IRE Watchdog Workshop. The year is given as 2017, so no issues there.

The title is "COVERING LOCAL GOVERNMENT". Now for the description, it needs to be a concise summary in simple language. The tipsheet covers managing stories with multimedia elements, building databases from public records, and dealing with sources outside the office. So I'll condense that into 1-2 sentences.

Keywords should be up to five terms, excluding the conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords would be "local government", "journalism tips", "public records", "multimedia storytelling", and "transparency".

I need to ensure all keys are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. I won't include any extra information beyond what's specified.

Putting it all together, the JSON should look something like this with all the required fields filled appropriately.
