Okay, I need to help the user by creating a JSON object based on their query. They provided a detailed tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference about federal spending data. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, the structure should include specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is given as 2833, so that's straightforward.

Next, the authors section needs to be a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the input, Sean Moulton from OMB Watch is listed with his email. Thereâ€™s no other author mentioned, so the list will have just one entry. I'll make sure not to invent any names.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE" since it's an IRE conference tipsheet. The year isn't explicitly provided in the text, so according to the instructions, I should set it to "Not Listed".

For the title, the tipsheet starts with "Following the Money: Federal Spending", which seems appropriate. 

The description needs a concise summary. The main focus is on federal contracts and assistance data, so I'll mention both FPDS and FAADS as key data systems.

Keywords are limited to five terms. They should exclude the conference and authors but include relevant topics like "Federal Contracts" and "Grants".

Putting it all together, I need to structure each part correctly, ensuring that all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. No markdown formatting, just a clean JSON object as per their request.
