Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an IRE conference. The user provided detailed information about covering immigration without living near a border by Daniel Connolly at the 2017 IRE National Conference in Phoenix.

First, I'll start by identifying each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

The ID is given as 5236. So that's straightforward.

Next, for authors, there's only one author mentioned: Daniel Connolly. His email is provided, danieljamesconnolly@gmail.com, but his affiliation isn't explicitly stated. However, since he's the author of a book and no news organization is listed with him in the text, I'll leave affiliation as null.

The conference is clearly stated as 2017 IRE National Conference, so the conference key will be "IRE" and the year is 2017.

The title of the tipsheet is given as "Covering immigration when you don’t live near a border."

Now, for the description, it should be a concise summary. The tipsheet provides strategies for journalists new to covering immigration, suggesting starting with simple stories like festivals or profiles, moving to explanatory pieces on policy, and then more advanced investigative topics. It also covers ethical considerations and resources.

So I'll condense that into 1-2 sentences: A guide for journalists on approaching immigration coverage, from initial community engagement to complex investigations, including ethics and resources.

Keywords should be no more than five terms related to the content but excluding conference and authors. From the tipsheet, relevant keywords could be immigration reporting, journalism resources, border coverage, investigative journalism, and journalism ethics.

Putting it all together, I structure each part into the JSON object with proper syntax, ensuring all keys are in quotes and values are correctly formatted.
