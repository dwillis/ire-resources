Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. Let me go through their instructions step by step.

First, they provided a tipsheet from an IRE conference titled "TEARING UP THE HIGHWAYS" with specific details about authors, conference info, and content. My task is to parse this information into a structured JSON format with specified keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The user mentioned that the ID should be T2464. So I'll set that as the "id".

Next, for "authors", there are two presenters: Aaron Wische and Mark Greenblatt. Each has a name, email, and affiliation. I need to list them as an array of objects with these attributes. Since both have their emails and affiliations provided, I can fill those in without issues.

The conference is clearly stated as the 2005 IRE National Conference in Denver, so "conference" will be "IRE" and "year" is 2005. The title is straightforward: "TEARING UP THE HIGHWAYS".

For the description, it needs to be a concise summary of the content. The tipsheet focuses on investigative strategies for reporting on local highway projects, including document analysis and expert consultation. I'll condense this into one or two sentences.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords might include "highway construction", "investigative reporting", "public records", "engineering oversight", and "infrastructure safety".

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly quoted. I'll structure everything accordingly without adding any extra information beyond what's provided.

    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",

  "description": "A tipsheet on investigative strategies for reporting on local highway projects, including document analysis and expert consultation.",
  "keywords": ["highway construction", "investigative reporting", "public records", "engineering oversight", "infrastructure safety"]
}
