Okay, so I need to help the user create a JSON object based on their query. Let me see what they're asking for.

First, they provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The title is "Authenticity: When things go wrong — Lessons learned from journalistic disasters" by Russ Baker. His contact info is there too—website and email.

The user wants me to structure this into a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The ID should be T2449 as given. 

Looking at the authors section, it's a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. Russ Baker is the only author here. His email is russ@russbaker.com, and his affiliation isn't explicitly stated next to his name, but he's an independent journalist. So I'll put that as his affiliation.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's straightforward. The year isn't mentioned in the text provided, so it should be "Not Listed". 

For the description, I need a 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. It should capture that the tipsheet provides lessons and practical advice on handling journalistic errors and maintaining integrity.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. The tipsheet talks about authenticity, mistakes, sources, transparency, and journalistic integrity. That makes sense as keywords.

I need to make sure all values are in English and enclosed in quotes. I'll structure it accordingly without adding any extra info beyond what's provided.

Wait, the user also mentioned that if an author's affiliation isn't listed next to their name but a news organization is mentioned elsewhere, use that. Russ is independent, so his affiliation is "Independent Journalist."

I think that covers all the points. Now I'll put it all together into the JSON format as specified.
