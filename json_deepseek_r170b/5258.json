Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given input about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The user provided specific instructions, so I'll follow those closely.

First, the structure requires keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is 5258 as specified. 

Looking at the input, there are four speakers listed with their details. Each should be an object in the authors array. For each speaker, I'll extract name, email, and affiliation. If any of these aren't present, they'll be null.

Nathan Halverson is from Reveal, so his affiliation is clear. His email is provided. Brant Houston's affiliation isn't directly listed with a news org, but he's associated with the University of Illinois as the Knight Chair. Mike McGraw is with KCPT, and Pam Dempsey leads the Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting.

Next, the conference is IRE since the input mentions it's from an IRE conference. The year isn't specified, so it'll be "Not Listed". 

The title should reflect the main topic, which seems to be investigating agribusiness and food systems. For the description, a concise summary of the tipsheet's focus on global food systems, foreign investments, etc., in 1-2 sentences.

Keywords are up to five terms. I'll pick relevant ones like "agribusiness", "food systems", "foreign investment", "investigative journalism", and "data journalism".

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly quoted. Also, no made-up names; if any speaker's info is missing, those fields will be null.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with each author as an object within the authors array and include all required keys with appropriate values.
