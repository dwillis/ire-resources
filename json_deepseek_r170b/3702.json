Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on how each part of the JSON should be structured.

First, I'll start by identifying all the required keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The id is straightforward; it's given as 3702.

Next, looking at the authors section. The tipsheet was prepared by Daniel Connolly, and there are co-panelists: Greg LeRoy, David Cay Johnston, and Jim Heaney. Each author should be an object with name, email, and affiliation. 

For Daniel Connolly:
- Name: "Daniel Connolly"
- Email: "danieljamesconnolly@gmail.com" (provided in the tipsheet)
- Affiliation: "The Commercial Appeal" since he's listed as a reporter there.

For Greg LeRoy:
- Name: "Greg LeRoy"
- Email: Not provided, so null
- Affiliation: "Good Jobs First"

David Cay Johnston:
- Name: "David Cay Johnston"
- Email: Not provided, so null
- Affiliation: "Reuters"

Jim Heaney:
- Name: "Jim Heaney"
- Email: Not provided, so null
- Affiliation: "Investigative Post"

The conference is clearly stated as IRE's 2012 national conference.

Year is given as 2012 since the tipsheet was prepared for that event.

Title of the tipsheet is "Finding the holes in economic impact studies."

For the description, it should be a concise summary. The tipsheet helps reporters question and analyze economic impact studies by considering who funds them, methodologies used, and suggests comparing findings with federal data.

Keywords should include relevant terms from the content: ["economic impact studies", "subsidies", "job creation", "government incentives", "investigative reporting"].

Now, I'll structure all these elements into a JSON object ensuring correct syntax and that all values are in English. Also, making sure not to invent any information.
