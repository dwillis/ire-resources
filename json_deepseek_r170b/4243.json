Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has provided specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, let me parse through the document provided. It seems to be from #IRE14, which indicates that the conference is "IRE" and the year is 2014. The title of the tipsheet is "THE DATA-DRIVEN STORY: Conceiving it, launching it and taking it home."

Looking at the authors section, there are four individuals mentioned:

1. Anthony Cormier - affiliated with Sarasota Herald-Tribune.
2. Jaeah Lee - from Mother Jones.
3. Rob O'Dell (the text says "Rob O’Dell" but in the closing thoughts, it's spelled as "robodellaz." I think that might be a typo; perhaps it's Rob O'Dell? Wait, actually looking back, the initial mention is "Rob O’Dell," so probably the correct name.
4. Shawn McIntosh - from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Each author has an affiliation, but only one (Shawn McIntosh) has an email provided: mcintosh@ajc.com. For the others, since emails aren't listed, I'll set their email to null.

The description should be a 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. The tipsheet covers how to develop data-driven stories, from idea generation to publication, including legal and fact-checking steps.

Keywords are up to five terms, excluding the conference name and authors. From the content, relevant keywords could be "data journalism," "investigative reporting," "fact checking," "legal risk," and "story development."

Putting it all together, I need to structure this into a JSON object with id 4243, authors as an array of objects each with name, email, and affiliation. The conference is "IRE," year is 2014, title as given, description as summarized, keywords as listed.

I also need to ensure that all values are in English and properly quoted.
