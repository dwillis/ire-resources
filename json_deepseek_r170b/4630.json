Alright, I need to create a JSON object from the given input based on specific instructions. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, the id is straightforward—it's given as 4630. 

Next, authors: there are two instructors mentioned—Chris Canipe and Jon McClure. Their emails and affiliations are provided. So I'll list them with their names, emails, and affiliations as "The Wall Street Journal" and "Dallas Morning News" respectively.

For the conference, the text mentions NICAR a few times, so that's clear. The year isn't explicitly stated, but looking at the URLs and the context, it seems to be from 2016. So I'll use that as the year.

The title is given directly: "Intro to D3 with a simple Scatterplot!".

The description needs to be a concise summary. The session covers using D3.js to create scatterplots, setting up SVG elements, scales, and axes. I'll condense this into one or two sentences.

Keywords should include terms related to the content but exclude the conference and authors. So "D3.js", "Scatterplot", "SVG", "Data visualization", and "JavaScript" are appropriate.

Putting it all together, I structure each key as per instructions and ensure everything is in English with proper formatting.
