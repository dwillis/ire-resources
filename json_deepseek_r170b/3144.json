Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from Jenni Bergal at NPR for an IRE conference in June 2008. Let me break down what's needed step by step.

First, the structure of the JSON should include id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is provided as 3144, so that's straightforward.

Next, the authors section is a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. Jenni Bergal is listed as the speaker from NPR, but there are no other authors mentioned. Since her email isn't provided, I'll leave it null. Her affiliation is clearly NPR, so I can fill that in.

The conference is IRE because it's explicitly stated as an IRE Tipsheet. The year is 2008 since the tipsheet is from June of that year.

For the title, it's given as "Shifting gears: Investigative life after newspapers," which I'll use verbatim.

The description needs to be a concise summary in simple terms. The tipsheet provides advice for transitioning from print journalism to radio or TV, so I can paraphrase that into one or two sentences.

Keywords should be no more than five and relevant to the content. From the tipsheet, key topics include investigative reporting, career transition, broadcast journalism, storytelling techniques, and media adaptation. These capture the essence without including the conference name or authors.

Now, putting it all together in JSON format, making sure all keys are enclosed in quotes and proper data types are usedâ€”like arrays for authors and keywords.
