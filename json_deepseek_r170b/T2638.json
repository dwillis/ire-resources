Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors conference. Let me read through the input carefully.

The title of the tipsheet is "Property, mortgages and foreclosures" presented at NICAR 2006 in Newark by John McCormick and David Jackson from the Chicago Tribune. Their emails are provided, so I should include those as well. 

First, the id needs to be T2638. Got that.

Next, authors should be a list of objects each with name, email, and affiliation. Both authors have their names listed, emails, and since they're from the Chicago Tribune, that's their affiliation. So each author object will have all three fields filled.

Conference is NICAR because it says NICAR 2006 â€“ Newark at the top. Year is clearly 2006.

For the title, I'll just use "Property, mortgages and foreclosures".

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet discusses using property records and data like HMDA for investigating mortgage fraud and its relation to race and poverty. So I can summarize that it provides tips on analyzing property and mortgage data for stories.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords would be "mortgage fraud", "foreclosure", "property records", "HMDA data", and "investigative reporting".

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part accordingly.
