Alright, so I need to create a JSON object from this input provided by the user. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, the structure of the JSON should have specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is fixed at 5602, which is straightforward.

Looking at the authors section, it's a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. The user emphasized not to make up names and to leave them as null if none are listed. Also, if there's a news organization mentioned next to an author's name, that should be used as their affiliation. Emails can remain null unless specified.

In the input provided, each line starts with a number followed by "STORIES" but then seems to list various titles and sometimes authors. For example, entry 1 has "Blaine Stewart / IRE19". So Blaine Stewart is the author, affiliated with IRE because of the "/IRE19" part.

Continuing through the entries, many have an author name followed by a conference abbreviation like IRE, NICAR, or another one. However, some just say "Not Listed" without any specific conference or year details.

For each entry, I'll extract the title and then look for the author. If there's an author mentioned, their name goes into the authors array with their affiliation as the conference they're associated with (like IRE or NICAR). Emails are null since they aren't provided.

The description needs to be a concise 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. For each story, I'll read the brief and create a short summary that captures the main point.

Conference is determined based on the abbreviation after the author's name. If it's IRE or NICAR, those are the conference names; otherwise, it's "Not Listed". The year is similarly extracted from the entry if present; if not, it defaults to "Not Listed".

Keywords should be up to five relevant terms excluding the conferences and authors. They need to be in English since all input is in English.

Looking at each of the 30 entries, I'll process them one by one:

1. Title: "How we did it" - Authors: Blaine Stewart (IRE). Description: A brief on investigative journalism techniques.
2. Entry 2: No author or conference specified, so authors are null, conference is Not Listed.

And so on for each entry, extracting the necessary info and structuring it into JSON format as per the user's specifications.

I also need to ensure that all values are in English and enclosed in quotes. The final JSON should accurately represent each of the 30 stories with their respective details.
