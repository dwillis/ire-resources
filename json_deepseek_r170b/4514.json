Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an IRE tipsheet. The tipsheet covers fracking and shale drilling. Let me break down each part.

First, the id is given as 4514. So that's straightforward. Next, looking for authors. In the text, Mike Soraghan from EnergyWire is listed, so he'll be one author. His email isn't provided, so it remains null. 

The conference mentioned is IRE in Philadelphia, June 2015, so the conference key will be "IRE" and year 2015. The title of the tipsheet is "Frack U. Tips for covering the shale drilling revolution."

For the description, I need a concise summary. It's about reporters covering fracking, focusing on spills, regulations, data sources. So I'll write it as: "Tips for journalists covering hydraulic fracturing, including how to track spills, understand regulation, and access key data."

Keywords should be up to five, excluding conference and authors. Relevant terms are fracking, shale drilling, environmental impact, oil and gas industry, regulatory reporting.

Putting it all together in JSON structure with proper formatting.
