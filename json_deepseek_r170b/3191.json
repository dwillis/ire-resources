Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user provided a chunk of text that seems to be part of a research paper or guide on statistical analysis using SPSS, specifically discussing chi-square tests.

First, they want me to create a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. They mentioned the id should be 3191. The authors are in a list, each with name, email, and affiliation. Since the original text doesn't mention any authors, I'll have to leave them as null.

The conference is either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Looking at the text, it mentions IRE (Investigative Reporters & Editors) in the footer, so the conference should be "IRE".

For the year, there's no specific date mentioned, so it'll default to "Not Listed".

The title needs to be extracted. The document seems to focus on Chi-Square Analysis using SPSS, so I'll use that as the title.

The description must be a concise summary in simple terms. It should mention teaching journalists how to analyze survey data with chi-square tests and interpret results.

Keywords are up to five relevant terms, excluding conference and authors. So, "Chi-Square", "SPSS", "Statistical Analysis", "Survey Data", and "Journalism" fit well.

I also need to ensure all values are in English since the original text is in English and enclose everything in quotes as per JSON standards.
