Okay, I need to create a JSON object from the given input based on specific instructions. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, the id should be 3276 as specified. 

Next, looking at the authors section. The input starts with Lyndsey Layton's details: name, email, phone number, and affiliation with The Washington Post. So, the authors list will have one entry with her name, email, and affiliation. There are no other authors mentioned, so that's it for the authors.

The conference is clearly stated as the 2009 IRE National Conference in Baltimore. Since IRE is one of the allowed options, conference should be "IRE". The year is obviously 2009, so that's straightforward.

For the title, the session is titled "Investigating Outbreaks" with a subtitle, but the main title is sufficient for the JSON.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet provides strategies for covering foodborne illnesses, so I'll mention that it offers tips and sources for journalists investigating such outbreaks.

Keywords should include relevant terms without including the conference or authors. From the content, key terms are foodborne illnesses, FDA, CDC, public health, and food safety.

I need to structure all this into a JSON object with the specified keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

Let me double-check each part:

- id: 3276
- authors: One entry with name Lyndsey Layton, email lavtonl@washpost.com, affiliation The Washington Post.
- conference: IRE
- year: 2009
- title: "Investigating Outbreaks"
- description: A concise summary about tips and sources for covering foodborne illnesses.
- keywords: Five relevant terms as mentioned.

I think that covers everything without missing any details. Now, I'll format it into JSON accordingly.

```json
{
  "id": 3276,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Lyndsey Layton",
      "email": "lavtonl@washpost.com",
      "affiliation": "The Washington Post"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2009,
  "title": "Investigating Outbreaks",
  "description": "This tipsheet provides strategies for covering foodborne illnesses, including attending media briefings, reviewing recall lists, and contacting industry insiders.",
  "keywords": ["foodborne illnesses", "FDA", "CDC", "public health", "food safety"]
}
```
