Okay, so I need to create a JSON object from the given tipsheet. Let's break down what's required.

First, the id is straightforwardâ€”it's 3490 as specified. Next, authors. The tipsheet mentions @sbhatt and @stiles. Since there are no full names or emails provided, their names will be null. Affiliation isn't listed either, so that remains null too. 

The conference is either IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed. Looking at the tipsheet, it's tagged with #NICARVIZ, so the conference should be "NICAR". The year isn't clearly stated in the text, so it defaults to "Not Listed".

For the title, the main heading is "Data Viz for Beginners", which seems appropriate.

The description needs a 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet talks about data visualization being accessible and powerful, helping readers understand data quickly. So I'll summarize that.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking through, relevant keywords are "data visualization", "tools", "resources", "journalism", and "beginners".

Putting it all together, the JSON structure takes shape with each key filled appropriately.

```json
{
  "id": 3490,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Data Viz for Beginners",
  "description": "A tipsheet introducing data visualization basics, tools, and resources for journalists.",
  "keywords": [
    "data visualization",
    "tools",
    "resources",
    "journalism",
    "beginners"
  ]
}
```
