Alright, I'm looking at this query where the user wants me to create a JSON object based on their specific instructions. The input provided seems to be from an IRE conference tipsheet about effective internet use for investigative reporters.

First, I need to extract the necessary information step by step. The id is given as 4264_1, so that's straightforward. Next, authors: Megan Luther is listed along with her affiliation, IRE & NICAR. Since there might be other presenters like Matt Waite and Duff Wilson mentioned, but their emails and affiliations aren't provided, I'll include them with nulls where needed.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that goes into the JSON. The year isn't explicitly mentioned, so it's set to "Not Listed". For the title, "EFFECTIVE USE OF THE INTERNET" fits perfectly. 

The description needs a concise summary. I'll focus on strategies for smarter searching and using alternative search engines, mentioning tools like Google's advanced features and domain searches.

Keywords should be relevant terms from the content, up to five. I'll pick "online research", "search strategies", "Google tips", "investigative reporting", and "digital tools".

I also need to ensure all values are in English and properly quoted, with no markdown formatting as per the user's request.
