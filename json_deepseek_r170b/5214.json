Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON, including certain keys like id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, I'll look for the ID. The user mentioned that it should be 5214, so I can set "id": "5214".

Next, the authors are listed as Emilia Diaz-Struck from ICIJ, Jack Gillum from The Washington Post, and Brad Heath from USA Today. Each author object needs a name, email, and affiliation. Since emails aren't provided, they'll be null. Affiliations will be their respective organizations.

The conference is clearly an IRE event, so "conference": "IRE". The year isn't mentioned in the text, so it should be "Not Listed".

For the title, looking at the headers, a good fit would be "Handling Massive Files, Leaked Data and Documents".

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers safe handling of leaked data, tools for analysis, authentication, legal risks, and case studies. So I'll phrase it as a 1-2 sentence overview.

Keywords should include terms like "leaked data", "document analysis", "data security", "authentication", and "journalistic investigation" to capture the main topics without including the conference or authors' names.

I'll structure all of this into a JSON object, making sure each key is enclosed in quotes and proper syntax is followed. I should avoid any markdown formatting as per the user's request.
