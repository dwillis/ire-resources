Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the `id` is given as 4954, so that's straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors. The text mentions three people: Ed Lowther, Nassos Stylianou, and Tom Nurse. Each has a name and some affiliations or handles. I'll list them with their names, emails (which are null since not provided), and affiliations from the text. 

The `conference` is specified as "NICAR" because the header mentions NICAR 2017 in Jacksonville.

For the `year`, it's clearly stated as 2017, so that's set.

The `title` should be "What is a flythrough?" since that's the main topic of the tipsheet.

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet explains how to create flythroughs using tools like Google Earth Pro, their benefits in storytelling, and examples from BBC and NYT. So, I'll summarize that into one or two sentences.

Keywords should capture the essence without including the conference or authors. Terms like "flythrough", "Google Earth Pro", "BBC Visual Journalism", "New York Times", and "satellite imagery" are relevant here.

Putting it all together, ensuring each part is correctly formatted in JSON with proper quotation marks and structure.
