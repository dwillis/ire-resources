Alright, so I need to help create a JSON object based on the provided input. The user has given specific instructions, so let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id is straightforwardâ€”it should be 4984. No issues there.

Next, looking at authors. The document mentions two people: Hannah Birch and Clarisa Diaz. I need to list them as authors with their names, emails, and affiliations. For Hannah, her email is hannah.birch@propublica.org and she's affiliated with ProPublica. Clarisa has cdiaz@wnyc.org and WNYC. So both will have their details filled in.

The conference isn't explicitly mentioned here. The user options are "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Since there's no mention of a specific conference, I'll set it to "Not Listed".

For the year, again, no specific event year is provided in the text, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed" as well.

The title should be a concise summary. The main focus seems to be on user testing for journalists and newsrooms, so I'll go with "User Testing for Journalists and Newsrooms".

Description needs to be 1-2 sentences. It's about why and how to conduct user testing, particularly in newsroom settings to improve projects.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference and authors. The relevant keywords here would be usability testing, audience research, design process, user-centered design, and product development.

Putting it all together now.
