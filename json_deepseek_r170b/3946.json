Alright, I'm trying to create a JSON object based on the user's query. They provided a detailed document about handling blowback after publishing stories, especially in journalism contexts.

First, I need to extract the necessary information. The id is given as 3946, so that's straightforward. Next, looking for authors. The text mentions "authors" but doesn't list any specific names, emails, or affiliations. So each author object will have null values except affiliation, which isn't provided either.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE", and the year is "2013". For the title, it's explicitly given as "Dealing with Blowback". The description should be a concise summary, so I'll mention strategies for handling responses to investigative stories, including preparation, writing, and post-publication engagement.

Keywords are next. The main points are blowback, journalism practices, ethics, public response, legal considerations, and media relations. But I need only five terms, so I'll pick the most relevant: Blowback, Journalism Practices, Investigative Reporting, Media Ethics, Public Response.

Putting it all together, I structure each part accordingly, ensuring that nulls are handled properly and everything is in English as required.

```json
{
  "id": 3946,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2013,
  "title": "Dealing with Blowback",
  "description": "This document provides strategies for handling responses and criticisms after publishing investigative stories, including preparation, writing practices, and post-publication engagement.",
  "keywords": [
    "Blowback",
    "Journalism Practices",
    "Investigative Reporting",
    "Media Ethics",
    "Public Response"
  ]
}
```
