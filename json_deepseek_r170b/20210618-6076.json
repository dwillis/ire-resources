Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided specific instructions with several keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, let's break down each part:

1. **id**: It should be 6076 as per the instruction.
2. **authors**: This is a list of elements with name, email, and affiliation. The user mentioned that if no names are listed, leave name as null. In the provided tipsheet, there's a mention of "Follow me on Twitter: @JournoKateH" which suggests the author might be Kate H., but it's not explicitly stated. Additionally, Helina Selemon from AP is thanked, so she should be included. Since the main presenter isn't clearly named beyond the Twitter handle, I'll list Helina Selemon with her affiliation as AP and leave the other author's name null but affiliated with the same organization if possible.
3. **conference**: The tipsheet is about background checks at an IRE conference, so it should be "IRE".
4. **year**: The year isn't clearly provided in the text, so it will be "Not Listed".
5. **title**: From the heading, the title is "Backgrounding Like a Boss: Perfecting your 15-minute background check and why you should do it every time."
6. **description**: Needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet emphasizes the importance of thorough background checks for all sources, including those who seem minor, and provides practical steps like Google searches, court records, professional licenses, etc.
7. **keywords**: Up to five relevant terms excluding conference and authors. Possible keywords are "backgrounding", "investigative journalism", "source verification", "reporting tips".

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with these elements, ensuring each key is in quotes and values are properly formatted. For the authors, since Helina Selemon is explicitly mentioned, she will be one author with her affiliation as AP. The main presenter isn't clearly named beyond the Twitter handle, so their name remains null but possibly affiliated if contextually appropriate.

I should also ensure that all values are in English and correctly enclosed within quotes without any markdown.
