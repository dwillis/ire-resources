Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. The input is from an IRE Conference tipsheet titled "CRASH COURSE" by Laura Ayo. 

First, I'll start by identifying each key required: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

The ID should be T2070 as specified.

For the authors, there's only one author listed—Laura Ayo from the Knoxville News Sentinel. Her email is ayol@knews.com. So, I'll structure her details accordingly with name, email, and affiliation.

Next, the conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's straightforward. The year is 2004 since the event took place in Atlanta, June 2004.

The title of the tipsheet is "CRASH COURSE."

Now, for the description, it needs to be a concise summary. Laura Ayo investigated if an interchange was the most hazardous by analyzing crash data. Despite initial claims, her analysis showed it wasn't the worst. I'll phrase this into a clear, 1-2 sentence summary.

Keywords should include relevant terms like transportation safety, crash data, investigative reporting, government accountability, and public records. These capture the essence without being too broad.

I'll make sure all values are in English, properly quoted, and that the JSON structure is valid. No markdown or extra formatting—just a clean JSON object as per the user's request.
