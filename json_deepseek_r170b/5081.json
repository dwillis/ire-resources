Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to create a JSON object from the given input based on the user's query. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, the user wants a response that's only a JSON object describing a tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors conferences. So, my focus is solely on converting the provided text into structured data with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

Looking at the input, I see it's about using Datawrapper presented by Stacy Jones and Grace Donnelly from Fortune Magazine at a NICAR 2017 event. The user also mentioned that if the year isn't clearly stated, it should be "Not Listed", but in this case, the URL includes nicar2017, so the year is definitely 2017.

The authors are listed with their names and emails, so I need to structure each author as an object within a list. Stacy Jones's email is stacy.jones@fortune.com, and Grace Donnelly's is grace.donnelly@fortune.com. Both affiliations are Fortune Magazine.

For the title, it seems to be "Using A Charting Tool" based on the header in the input. The description needs to be a concise summary of what Datawrapper is and its benefits, so I'll mention that it's a tool for creating standard charts with a gentle learning curve and great for standardizing visual styles.

Keywords should include terms like "Datawrapper", "charting tools", "data visualization", "journalism tools", and "newsroom standards". These capture the essence of the tipsheet without including the conference or authors as per the user's instructions.

I need to ensure all keys are in quotes, the structure is correct, and there are no markdown elements. The id is given as 5081, so that's straightforward.

Putting it all together, I'll format each section carefully, making sure not to miss any details from the input. Double-checking for any possible errors or omissions to ensure accuracy.
