Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, the id is straightforward—it's given as 5106.

Next, for authors, I see that Marla Steinberg PhD is listed. Her email is marlasteinberg@telus.net, and her affiliation is with the University of British Columbia as an Adjunct Professor in the School of Population and Public Health. So I'll structure this information correctly under authors.

The conference key should be "IRE" since it's from an IRE event. The year isn't explicitly mentioned, so I'll default to "Not Listed".

The title is clear: "Looking at Impact: Tips and Tools from an Evaluator". 

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet provides strategies for evaluating impact in journalism projects, focusing on defining outcomes, audience analysis, and using existing frameworks. So I'll condense that into one or two sentences.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference name. From the content, "impact evaluation", "outcomes", "audience analysis", "frameworks", and "journalism" are relevant. 

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly quoted. I'll structure the JSON accordingly without any markdown formatting as per the user's request.

Now, putting it all together, making sure each key is correctly formatted with the right data types—authors being an array of objects, keywords a list, etc.
