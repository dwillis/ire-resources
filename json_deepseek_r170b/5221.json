Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's instructions from their query. Let me start by understanding what they're asking for.

First, the user provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The document includes URLs, slides, setup instructions, exercises, and resources. They want this information converted into a specific JSON structure with keys like id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

The id is given as 5221, so that's straightforward. Next, the authors section requires a list where each entry has name, email, and affiliation. The user specified not to make up names and to leave them as null if none are listed. Looking at the provided text, I don't see any author names mentioned, so the authors array will have an object with all nulls.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE since it's from their event. The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the text, so according to instructions, I'll set it to "Not Listed". 

For the title, the document mentions "Web development hands-on: Notes" which seems appropriate. The description needs to be a concise summary of 1-2 sentences. The tipsheet covers web development basics with practical exercises, so I'll phrase that accordingly.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Relevant terms here are web development, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and hands-on exercises.

Putting it all together, I structure each part into the JSON format as specified, ensuring all keys and values are properly enclosed in quotes.

```json
{
  "id": 5221,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Web development hands-on: Notes",
  "description": "A hands-on guide to web development basics, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Includes exercises and resources for further learning.",
  "keywords": [
    "web development",
    "HTML",
    "CSS",
    "JavaScript",
    "hands-on exercises"
  ]
}
```
