Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided some slides about using animation for storytelling by Kavya Sukumar. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the id is given as 5094, so that's straightforward. 

Next, authors: there's only one author mentioned here, which is Kavya Sukumar. Her email isn't provided in the slides, but her affiliation is Vox Media since she works in their Storytelling Studio. So I'll list her with name "Kavya Sukumar", email null, and affiliation "Vox Media".

Conference: The user's input mentions it's from an IRE conference, so that should be "IRE". 

Year: Looking at the slides, thereâ€™s no specific year mentioned. The only clue is she was a fellow in 2015, but without a clear event year, I'll set it to "Not Listed".

Title: It's clearly "Animation for Storytelling".

Description needs to be a concise summary. The session focuses on using animation tools like After Effects and Adobe Expressions to enhance storytelling. So the description should capture that.

Keywords: I need up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the slides, relevant keywords are "animation", "storytelling", "After Effects", "Adobe Expressions", and maybe "video production". But since it's about using these tools for journalism, perhaps "journalism" as a keyword fits too. Wait, but video production is more general. I think sticking with animation, storytelling, After Effects, Adobe Expressions makes sense.

Putting it all together in JSON format, ensuring proper syntax and quotation marks.
