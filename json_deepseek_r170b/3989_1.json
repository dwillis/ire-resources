Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, the id is provided as "3989_1", so that's straightforward.

Looking for authors: The text mentions Kelly Carr, who is the Senior Online Producer at Reynolds Center for Business Journalism. There's no other author listed, so I'll include her with her email and affiliation.

Conference is clearly stated as IRE since it's from an IRE event.

The year is June 14, 2013, so that goes into the year field.

Title of the tipsheet is "Shell Companies and Fraud: An Investigative Primer".

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet explains what shell companies are, their legitimate and illicit uses, and why they're important for journalists to investigate due to connections with money laundering, tax evasion, etc. So, I'll condense that into 1-2 sentences.

Keywords should be up to five terms related to the content but excluding the conference and authors. Shell companies, fraud, money laundering, tax evasion, and corporate secrecy fit well here.

Putting it all together, ensuring each field is correctly formatted with quotes and proper structure.
