Alright, so I need to create a JSON object from the given input based on specific instructions. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id should be 4502. That's straightforward.

Next, authors is a list where each element has name, email, and affiliation. The user mentioned not to make up names and leave them as null if none are listed. Looking at the input, I don't see any author names provided, so the authors array will have an object with all attributes set to null.

For the conference key, it needs to be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". The input doesn't specify a conference name or any event details, so it should default to "Not Listed".

The year is next. If not clearly identified, it's also set to "Not Listed". No specific year was mentioned in the text, so that's the value here.

The title needs to be extracted from the input. The main focus seems to be on investigative reporting techniques, specifically about identifying domestic violence cases and gathering related information. So I'll craft a title that reflects this process.

Description must be a concise summary of 1-2 sentences in simple language. It should encapsulate the challenges faced by reporters in accessing necessary documents and the strategies they use despite these obstacles.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference or authors. From the text, relevant keywords include "investigative reporting", "domestic violence", "court transcripts", "pre-sentence investigation", and "journalistic techniques".

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part into the JSON format as specified.

```json
{
  "id": 4502,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigative Reporting on Domestic Violence Cases: Challenges and Strategies",
  "description": "This text discusses the challenges journalists face in accessing court documents and transcripts to report on domestic violence cases, offering strategies to overcome these obstacles.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative reporting",
    "domestic violence",
    "court transcripts",
    "pre-sentence investigation",
    "journalistic techniques"
  ]
}
```
