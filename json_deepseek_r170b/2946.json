Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through this step by step.

First, looking at the document provided, it's about Caspio Bridge, a tool for creating online databases without programming. The author is David A. Milliron, affiliated with Caspio, Inc., and his contact information includes email and phone number. 

The id should be 2946 as specified. Authors is a list; here there's only one author, so the list has one element. His name is provided, so that goes in. Email is given, david.milliron@caspio.com, and affiliation is Caspio, Inc.

Conference is IRE since it's an IRE conference tipsheet. Year isn't explicitly mentioned, so it defaults to "Not Listed".

The title of the tipsheet seems to be "No-Hassle Database Publishing". The description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. Caspio allows users to import data and create searchable databases on their websites without needing programming skills. So I'll phrase that clearly.

Keywords should be up to five terms, excluding the conference name and authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords are online databases, data publishing, web forms, crime data, and CSS customization. That's five.

Putting it all together, structure each key accordingly, ensuring everything is in English and properly quoted.
