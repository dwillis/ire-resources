Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an IRE conference. The user has given specific instructions about the structure of the JSON.

First, the id is set to 5110 as per the instruction. Next, looking at the authors section: Joe Wertz is clearly mentioned, along with his email and affiliation with StateImpact Oklahoma. There's no other author listed, so the authors array only includes him.

The conference is IRE, since it's from an IRE Tulsa Watchdog Workshop in 2017, so year is 2017. The title of the tipsheet seems to be about oil, injection, and earthquakes in Oklahoma.

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet discusses how increased oil and gas production led to more earthquakes, the industry's initial doubts, and regulatory responses. So the description should capture that concisely.

Keywords are next. They include oil, earthquakes, Oklahoma, regulation, and injection wells. These are all relevant and under five terms.

I need to make sure all keys and values are in quotes. Also, since the year is clear from the context (2017), I can confidently set it as such.

Now, putting it all together, ensuring that each part aligns with the user's specifications.
