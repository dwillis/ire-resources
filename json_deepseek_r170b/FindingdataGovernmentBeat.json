Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let's break down what's needed.

First, the structure should include id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is given as "FindingdataGovernmentBeat". 

Next, looking at the authors: Jim Miller and Mc Nelly Torres are listed with their emails and affiliations. I'll need to create an array of objects for each author. Each object should have name, email, and affiliation.

The conference location was St. Louis, Mo., in 2012, so the year is clear as 2012. The title seems to be "Getting intimate with government data to produce hard-hitting stories".

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about using public records and data analysis for investigative journalism, focusing on education, elections, voter registration, census, and redistricting.

Keywords should be no more than five terms. Looking at the content, "government data", "public records", "data analysis", "investigative journalism", and "census" are relevant.

I also need to ensure that all values are in English and properly quoted.
