Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id is specified as 3717, so that's straightforward.

Looking at the authors section, the document mentions @DougHaddix. His name is Doug Haddix, but his email and affiliation aren't provided in the text. So I'll set those to null.

Next, the conference is clearly an IRE event because it's from their conferences, so that key will be "IRE".

The year isn't mentioned anywhere in the text, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

For the title, since the tipsheet covers various social media tools for journalism, a suitable title would be "Social Media Tools for Journalists".

The description should be a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about using platforms like Pinterest, Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn for finding sources, tracking conversations, and engaging audiences. So I'll write it as a 1-2 sentence overview of that.

Keywords are important here. The main tools mentioned include Pinterest, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and other social media tools. I'll list these as the keywords, making sure not to exceed five terms.

Putting it all together, each key needs to be in quotes, and the structure must be correct with proper commas and brackets.

    {
      "name": null,

    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Social Media Tools for Journalists",
  "description": "A tipsheet covering various social media tools and techniques for journalists to find sources, track conversations, and engage with audiences.",
  "keywords": [
    "Pinterest",
    "Twitter",
    "Facebook",
    "LinkedIn",
    "social media tools"
