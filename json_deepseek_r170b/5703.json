Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, I see that the id is given as 5703, so I'll set that as is. Next, looking at the authors section, Brad Heath is listed with his email and affiliation to USA TODAY. There's no other author mentioned, so the authors list will have just one entry with name, email, and affiliation.

The conference is IRE because the tipsheet is from an IRE event. The year isn't provided in the text, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed". The title of the tipsheet is clear: "DIGGING INTO FEDERAL COURT RECORDS".

For the description, I need a concise summary. The main points are about using PACER and other tools to access federal court records for investigative reporting. So I'll phrase that into one or two simple sentences.

Now, keywords. They should be relevant but not include the conference or authors. From the content, terms like "PACER", "federal court records", "investigative reporting", "court documents", and "legal research" seem appropriate. I'll pick the top five that best capture the essence.

Putting it all together, I structure each part into the JSON format with proper quotation marks and ensure all keys are correct. No markdown is used, just plain JSON.
