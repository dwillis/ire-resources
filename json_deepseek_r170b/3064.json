Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down what's required step by step.

First, the structure should have specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is given as 3064. 

Looking at the authors section, I see Mc Nelly Torres listed with her email and affiliation to the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. So, the authors array will have one object with her details.

The conference is clearly stated as the 2008 CAR Conference in Houston, Texas. Since CAR stands for Computer-Assisted Reporting, which is associated with IRE, the conference key should be "IRE". The year is 2008, so that's straightforward.

The title of the tipsheet is provided as "CAR and Consumer stories: using data and documents to build stories that matter." 

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet focuses on how to use government data and documents to develop impactful consumer stories, highlighting sources like lawsuits and regulatory agencies. So, I'll craft a 1-2 sentence summary capturing that essence.

Keywords should be relevant and limited to five. From the content, "consumer journalism," "data journalism," "government data," "investigative reporting," and "public records" seem appropriate as they encapsulate the main themes without including the conference or author names.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each key with proper formatting, ensuring all values are in English and enclosed in quotes. I also need to make sure that if any information isn't available, like other authors, it's handled appropriatelyâ€”in this case, there's only one author mentioned.
