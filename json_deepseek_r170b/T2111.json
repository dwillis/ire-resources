Alright, so I've got this query where someone wants me to create a JSON object based on their provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let's break down what they're asking for.

First, the user specified that the response must be only a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. They also gave clear instructions on how each key should be populated. The ID is T2111, which I need to include exactly as given.

Looking at the content they provided, it's about broadcasting skills, specifically blending CAR (Computer-Assisted Reporting) into TV. The speaker is Joe Ellis from KDFW in Dallas/Ft. Worth. His contact info is there too: phone and email. So for the authors array, I need to list him with his name, email, and affiliation. Since the news organization is mentioned as KDFW – Dallas / Ft. Worth, that becomes his affiliation.

The conference isn't explicitly stated in their text, so according to their instructions, it should be "Not Listed". Same with the year; there's no date provided, so I'll mark that as "Not Listed" too.

For the title, it seems clear: "BROADCAST SKILLS: BLENDING CAR IN TO TV". Even though there's a typo in "IN TO", I think it's best to keep it as is unless instructed otherwise.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet offers advice on using data in TV stories, so I'll phrase it simply, mentioning the integration of data journalism into broadcast storytelling and practical tips for reporters.

Keywords are next. They want up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking at the content, "data journalism", "broadcast skills", "CAR", "investigative reporting", and "storytelling" seem appropriate. I'll make sure they're all in lowercase as per their example.

I also need to ensure that all values are in English unless specified otherwise, which they are here. Each key and value must be enclosed in quotes, so I have to structure the JSON correctly without any markdown or additional text.

Double-checking everything: authors have name, email, affiliation (with KDFW as the affiliation), conference and year set correctly, description is a clear summary, keywords are relevant and within the limit. 

I think that's all covered. Time to put it together into a properly formatted JSON object.
