Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, they provided a detailed response that includes information about landing a book deal, writing a manuscript, and promoting it while keeping a day job. The authors are Blake Ellis and Melanie Hicken, who wrote "A Deal with the Devil." They also mentioned their Twitter handles and emails, along with affiliations to CNN. 

The user wants me to extract specific data points: id as 5631_1, authors as a list with name, email, and affiliation, conference type (which in this case is IRE), year if available, a brief description, keywords, etc.

Looking at the content, there are sections on writing proposals, landing contracts, writing the book, and promoting it. So the keywords could include things like "book proposal," "investigative journalism," "publishing contract," "manuscript writing," and "book promotion."

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's straightforward. The year isn't mentioned in the text provided, so it should be "Not Listed." The authors' names are given, along with their emails and CNN affiliation.

I'll structure each author entry with their name, email, and affiliation. For the description, a concise summary of how to manage writing a book while working full-time would fit.

Putting it all together, I need to make sure the JSON syntax is correct: keys in quotes, proper commas, and no trailing spaces. The id is fixed as 5631_1, so that's easy.

I also have to ensure that the keywords are relevant but not too manyâ€”no more than five. They should capture the essence without including the conference or authors' names.

Double-checking for any missing info: since year isn't provided, I leave it as "Not Listed." Emails and affiliations are present, so those go into each author's entry.

Alright, I think that covers everything the user requested.
