Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. They provided a detailed text about investigating college sports finances and other related topics. First, I should parse the input to extract necessary information.

The id is given as 5552, so that's straightforward. For authors, the text mentions several people: Sarah Kendzior, Dan Bauman, and others like John Perry, but only first names are mentioned without emails or affiliations. Since the user said not to make up names, I'll set their details to null.

The conference isn't explicitly stated in the text, so it should be "Not Listed". The year is also missing, so that will be "Not Listed" too. 

The title can be derived from the main topic, which seems to be about college sports finances and investigative tips. I'll use a descriptive title like they provided.

For the description, I need a concise summary. It should mention the key areas discussed: financial practices, off-field activities, resources for journalists, and mention both public and private universities.

Keywords are limited to five terms, so I'll choose relevant ones like "college sports", "financial investigation", "athletics department", "university finances", and "investigative journalism".

Putting it all together, the JSON structure should have each key with appropriate values. I need to ensure that strings are in quotes and that lists are correctly formatted.
