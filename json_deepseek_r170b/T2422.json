Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. Let me read through their instructions carefully.

First, they want the response to only be a JSON object without any additional text. The JSON should describe a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference.

The structure requires specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is given as "T2422". 

Looking at the input provided, Tom Farrey is listed as the author. His email isn't provided, so that field will be null. His affiliation is ESPN, both as a Senior Writer for ESPN The Magazine and a Correspondent for ESPN television. So in the authors array, I'll include his name and set email to null.

The conference is clearly stated as the 2005 IRE National Conference in Denver. Therefore, the conference key will be "IRE" and the year will be 2005.

For the title, it's "Sports Investigations". The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet discusses two types of sports investigations: those relevant to fans and those affecting society, emphasizing their connection to broader cultural issues. So I'll craft a 1-2 sentence summary capturing that essence.

Keywords should be no more than five terms, excluding the conference and authors. From the content, suitable keywords are "sports journalism", "investigative reporting", "FOIA", "college athletics", and "academic integrity".

I need to ensure all keys and values are enclosed in quotes and written in English. I'll structure each part step by step to avoid missing any details.

Let me put it all together now, making sure the syntax is correct and all fields are properly included.
