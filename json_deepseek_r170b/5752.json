Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference, specifically NICAR19. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the structure required: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The ID is given as 5752. 

Next, the authors section needs to be a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. However, in the provided tipsheet, there are no specific authors mentioned. So each author object will have null for name, email, and affiliation.

The conference is NICAR since it's from the NICAR19 presentation. The year should be 2019 because NICAR19 refers to the 2019 conference.

For the title, the original tipsheet starts with "Tipsheet: What coding language should I learn?" So that will be the title.

The description needs to be a concise summary of the content. The tipsheet compares different programming languages like JavaScript, Python, R, and SQL, discussing their uses, strengths, and weaknesses. It also provides resources for learning these languages. So the description can be something like: "A guide comparing coding languages such as JavaScript, Python, R, and SQL, discussing their applications, pros, cons, and learning resources."

Keywords should be a list of up to five relevant terms. The main languages are JavaScript, Python, R, SQL, and data visualization since that's a key application area.

Now, putting it all together in JSON format with the specified keys and structures.

```json
{
  "id": 5752,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": 2019,
  "title": "Tipsheet: What coding language should I learn?",
  "description": "A guide comparing coding languages such as JavaScript, Python, R, and SQL, discussing their applications, pros, cons, and learning resources.",
  "keywords": [
    "JavaScript",
    "Python",
    "R",
    "SQL",
    "data visualization"
  ]
}
```
