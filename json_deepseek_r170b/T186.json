Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided query. The user has given me a detailed tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down what each part of the JSON should include.

First, the ID is straightforward: T186 as specified. Next, the authors. Looking through the text, I see the St. Louis Post-Dispatch is mentioned several times but no individual author names are provided. So, I'll set each author's name to null and their affiliation to "St. Louis Post-Dispatch". Since there are multiple mentions of the newspaper, I might need to list a few authors with these details.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE. The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the text, so I'll default that to "Not Listed".

For the title, the main topic seems to be about investigating floodplain development and insurance programs. So, something like "Investigating Floodplain Development and Insurance Programs" should work.

The description needs a concise summary. The tipsheet discusses how local zoning laws and insurance policies allow risky building in flood-prone areas. That's the key point to include in one or two sentences.

Keywords are next. I'll pull out relevant terms like "floodplains", "insurance programs", "zoning laws", "environmental impact", and "development". These capture the essence without including the conference name or authors.

I should make sure that all fields are enclosed in quotes and that there's no made-up data. Everything needs to be in English as per the instructions. Let me structure this into JSON, ensuring proper syntax with commas separating each key-value pair.
