Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has specified several keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the id is given as T2355, so that's straightforward. 

Next, the authors section requires a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the tipsheet, it says "Tip sheet prepared by Randy Reddick. Texas Tech University r.reddick@ttu.edu". So there's one author: Randy Reddick. His email is provided as r.reddick@ttu.edu, and his affiliation is Texas Tech University. No need to list any others since only he's mentioned.

The conference is NICAR, which stands for National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting. The year is clearly stated as 2005 in the tip sheet. 

For the title, it seems to be "Cool tools from Mozilla-based browsers", taken from the top of the document.

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet discusses features like "What's Related" sidebar, customizable search forms, and live bookmarks via RSS in Firefox. So I'll summarize that it highlights these tools for enhancing browsing and research efficiency.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Relevant terms here are Mozilla-based browsers, search tools, RSS feeds, live bookmarks, and browser customization. That makes five, so I can list all of them.

Putting it all together, each key is filled appropriately with the extracted information, ensuring correct data types and formatting.
