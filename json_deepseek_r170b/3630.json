Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me start by understanding what's required.

First, the id is fixed at 3630. Next, the authors are Sharon Machlis and Cheryl Phillips. Their emails aren't provided, but their affiliations are Computerworld and The Seattle Times respectively. So I'll note that down with nulls for email since they're not listed.

The conference mentioned in the tipsheet is NICAR, so that's clear. The year isn't explicitly stated, but since it's common to have years in URLs like NICAR2012, I can infer it as 2012. So the year will be "2012".

For the title, it's about free tools for data visualization and analysis, which is straightforward.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers various free tools, their uses, ease of use, and includes examples. So I'll summarize that in one or two sentences.

Keywords should be up to five terms. Looking at the content, "data visualization", "free tools", "journalism", "NICAR", and "tools" seem appropriate. Wait, "tools" is too generic. Maybe replace it with something more specific like "analysis". But looking back, "free tools for data visualization" are emphasized, so I'll stick with that.

Putting it all together, I need to structure this into a JSON object with the specified keys and ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes.
