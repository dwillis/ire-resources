Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the ID is given as T2723. So that's straightforward. 

Next, the authors section. The input lists Alex Nussbaum with his email, phone number, and affiliation with The Record of Bergen County, NJ. Thereâ€™s another mention of Ford Motor Co., but they're the subject, not an author. So I'll include only Alex Nussbaum as an author. His name is provided, so that's filled in, along with his email and the affiliation from his contact info.

The conference is clearly stated as the 2006 IRE National Conference, so the conference key will be "IRE" and the year is 2006.

The title of the tipsheet is "Uncovering Industrial Waste - Snooping on Superfund". 

For the description, it needs to be a concise summary. The series by The Record exposed Ford's dumping and the EPA's failure to clean up, so I'll summarize that in one or two sentences.

Keywords should be relevant and limited to five. From the content, "Superfund sites", "industrial waste", "EPA", "environmental cleanup", and "investigative reporting" seem appropriate.

Now, putting it all together, ensuring that each field is correctly formatted with quotes and proper structure.
