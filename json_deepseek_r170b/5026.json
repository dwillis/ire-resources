Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given input. The user has provided a detailed structure with specific instructions.

First, let's parse the input. It seems like it's from a conference presentation about bots in journalism, specifically from NICAR 2017. The title is "The Present & Future of Bots".

Looking at the authors, the input mentions "Sanjana Gupta" from NYU and "Ian Sample" from The Guardian, among others, but their details aren't explicitly provided next to their names. Since the instructions say not to make up names and leave them null if none are listed, I'll have to see which authors are clearly mentioned with affiliations.

The description needs to be a concise summary. So, something about how bots are used in journalism for tasks like reporting, engagement, and data analysis.

Keywords should include terms like "bots", "journalism", "automation", etc., up to five.

Now, I need to structure this into the JSON format with the specified keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is 5026 as given.

For authors, since only Sanjana Gupta and Ian Sample are mentioned with affiliations (NYU and The Guardian), they will be included. Others like "Tsvetkova" don't have enough info to include without making things up.

Putting it all together, the JSON should reflect this structure accurately.

```json
{
  "id": 5026,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": 2017,
  "title": "The Present & Future of Bots",
  "description": "A presentation discussing the role and potential of bots in journalism, including their use for engagement, reporting, and data analysis.",
  "keywords": [
    "bots",
    "journalism",
    "automation",
    "technology",
    "media"
  ]
}
```
