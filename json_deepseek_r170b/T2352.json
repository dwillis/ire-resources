Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors conference. The user has provided specific instructions on how to structure this JSON.

First, I'll identify the id as "T2352" since that's specified. Next, looking at the authors section: Sarah Cohen is listed with her email and affiliation as The Washington Post. So, her details will be included in an array under authors.

The conference name isn't explicitly mentioned, but given the context and the mention of CAR (which I know stands for Computer-Assisted Reporting), it's likely an IRE event. So, the conference key will be "IRE". The year is provided as part of the title: Hollywood CAR 2005, so the year should be 2005.

For the title, it's clearly stated as "Drilling for Oil with CAR". The description needs to be a concise summary. I'll make sure it captures the essence of using CAR techniques in investigative reporting, mentioning early planning and balancing risks.

Keywords are limited to five terms. The main topics here are CAR (Computer-Assisted Reporting), data analysis, investigative journalism, risk management, and database reporting. These seem relevant and cover the key points without including the conference or authors.

I need to ensure all keys are enclosed in quotes and that the JSON structure is correct. I'll avoid any markdown formatting as per the instructions. Also, since the user provided an example response, I can model my JSON after that but make sure it's accurate based on the given text.
