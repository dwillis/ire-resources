Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. They provided detailed information about a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference regarding the recovery efforts in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria.

First, the id is given as 5649, so that's straightforward.

Next, the authors are listed: Frances Robles, Carla Minet, Mc Nelly Torres, and Luis Trelles. I'll create an array of objects for each author. Each object should have name, email, and affiliation. Since emails aren't provided, they will be null. Affiliations are mentioned in the panelist section, so I can extract those.

The conference is IRE because it's from Investigative Reporters and Editors. The year isn't explicitly stated, but looking at the context of Hurricane Maria (2017) and the events described, it's likely around 2018 or later when such conferences would discuss these topics. However, without a clear year, I'll set it to "Not Listed".

The title is "Looking for Accountability on the Recovery Efforts in Puerto Rico", which directly reflects the content.

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet covers issues like power grid failures, health service breakdowns, and discrepancies in death toll reports after Maria. So the summary should capture these points succinctly.

Keywords should be relevant terms excluding the conference name and authors. I'll choose "Hurricane Maria", "Puerto Rico recovery", "power restoration", "health services", and "death toll" as they encapsulate the main topics.

Putting it all together, I structure each key accordingly, ensuring proper formatting with quotes and commas.
