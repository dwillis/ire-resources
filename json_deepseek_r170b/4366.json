Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the input provided. Let me start by reading through the user's query carefully.

The input seems to be a set of slides from a presentation titled "Behind The Boom." It mentions an author named Robert Gebeloff with his email and affiliation as The New York Times. The conference is NICAR, and the year is 2015. There's also a description and some keywords related to data journalism.

First, I'll extract the id which is given as 4366. 

Next, for authors, there's only one author listed: Robert Gebeloff. His email is robert.gebeloff@nytimes.com, and his affiliation is The New York Times. So the authors array will have one object with these details.

The conference is clearly stated as NICAR, so that's straightforward. The year is 2015 since it's part of the conference identifier (NICAR 15).

For the title, I'll use "Behind The Boom" as given in the slides.

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The presentation talks about data journalism techniques and analyzing the North Dakota oil boom's environmental impact. So I'll craft a sentence that captures both aspects without being too lengthy.

Keywords should be relevant and limited to five. Looking at the content, "data journalism," "North Dakota oil boom," and "environmental impact" seem appropriate. I can add "journalism techniques" and "oil industry regulation" to cover more angles from the slides.

I need to make sure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, no markdown should be used, so I'll avoid any formatting beyond the JSON structure.

Putting it all together, the JSON object will have id 4366, an authors array with Robert's details, conference as NICAR, year 2015, a clear title and description, and five relevant keywords.
