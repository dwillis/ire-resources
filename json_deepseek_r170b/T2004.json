Alright, let me process this query step by step. The user has provided a detailed tipsheet from an IRE conference and wants a JSON object created with specific keys. 

First, I need to parse the input thoroughly. The main title is "The majority minority: Black kids in adult prison" and the author is Doug Stanley from The Tampa Tribune. His contact info is included.

Looking at the structure, the user specified the keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. 

For the id, it should be T2004 since the conference was in 2004. Authors is a list; here, only Doug Stanley is listed with his email and affiliation as The Tampa Tribune.

The conference is NICAR because the tipsheet mentions the 2004 NICAR Conference in Cincinnati. Year is clearly 2004.

Title is straightforward from the input: "The majority minority: Black kids in adult prison".

Description needs to be a concise summary. The study found that 67% of minors sentenced to adult time were black, so I'll mention that disparity and the data analysis aspect.

Keywords should capture the essence without being too many. I'll choose "racial disparities", "juvenile justice", "prison sentencing", "data journalism", and "criminal justice system".

Now, putting it all together in JSON format as per instructions. Making sure each key is correctly formatted with quotes and proper structure.
