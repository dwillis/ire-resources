Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has specified that the response should only include this JSON object without any additional explanation or formatting. 

First, let's break down the input provided:

The title of the session is "Putting your town under a microscope -and keeping it there." It features three speakers: Kate Howard from Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting, Matt Kiefer from The Chicago Reporter, and John Diedrich from Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

Looking at the content, it's divided into sections about getting started on a new beat, following up on investigations, and publishing data. Each section has bullet points with tips like reading archives, using FOIA requests, organizing documents, etc.

The user wants me to structure this information into a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 5363. 

For the authors array, each entry should have name, email, and affiliation. Since emails aren't provided, they'll be null. Affiliations are the news organizations listed after each speaker's name.

The conference is NICAR, which stands for National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting, so that goes into the conference key. The year isn't mentioned, so it should be "Not Listed."

The description needs to be a concise summary of 1-2 sentences. I'll focus on the main idea: providing tips for investigative journalists covering local beats and conducting follow-ups.

Keywords are up to five terms, excluding the conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords could be "investigative journalism," "local reporting," "FOIA requests," "data publishing," and "follow-up investigations."

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part accordingly, ensuring that all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes.
