Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. Let me read through their instructions carefully.

First, they provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The speaker is Robert McClure, who's the Executive Director at InvestigateWest. The conference details are IRE Annual Conference in June 2013, San Antonio, TX.

The main story is about state and local governments violating federal law by converting parks funded by the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act to other uses without proper replacement. The background explains how these funds were meant for public recreation and the consequences of conversion. There are examples like a park becoming a hotel or a McDonald's, which makes it newsworthy.

The user wants a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 3967. Authors should be a list where each has name, email, and affiliation. Since Robert McClure's info is provided, I'll include him. His email is rmcclure@invw.org, and his affiliation is InvestigateWest.

The conference is clearly listed as IRE Annual Conference, so the conference key is "IRE". The year is 2013. For the title, it's about investigating park conversions. The description needs to be a concise summaryâ€”maybe something like governments converting parks illegally without replacement.

Keywords should be no more than five terms related to the topic but excluding the conference and authors. I can use "Land and Water Conservation Fund", "park conversion", "federal law violations", "public recreation", and "environmental investigation".

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, if any info isn't available, like other authors, I just include what's there.

Let me structure this step by step to make sure I don't miss anything.
