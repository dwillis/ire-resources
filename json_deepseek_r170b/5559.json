Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, the id is fixed as 5559. Got that down.

Next are the authors. There are three names mentioned: Matt Dempsey from the Houston Chronicle, Jennifer LaFleur from the Investigative Reporting Workshop, and Jodi Upton from Syracuse University. Each author entry needs to have name, email, and affiliation. I'll list their affiliations as given. For emails, only Jennifer's is provided (jlafleur@irworkshop.org), so Matt and Jodi will have null for email since theirs aren't listed.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE" in the document. The year isn't mentioned anywhere, so I'll set it to "Not Listed".

For the title, it seems to be "The power of data". That's straightforward.

The description needs a 1-2 sentence summary. Looking at the content, it covers how data journalism involves various steps like analyzing databases, scraping, FOIA requests, and using tools. So I'll summarize that data journalism combines these methods to uncover stories.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. The main points are data journalism, analysis, visualization, public records, and coding. That fits well.

Putting it all together, each part maps to the keys as per instructions. Making sure everything is in English and properly quoted.
