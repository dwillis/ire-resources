Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down what's required step by step.

First, I'll start by identifying the key elements that need to be included in the JSON: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

The ID is given as 4195, so that's straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors section. The tipsheet lists four people with their emails:
- Andy Hall [ahall@wisconsinwatch.org]
- Nick Penzenstadler [penzenstadler@gmail.com]
- Brant Houston [brant.houston@gmail.com]
- Lauren Mills [lauren­mills@iowawatch.org]

I notice that the affiliations can be inferred from their email domains. Andy Hall is likely affiliated with Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism, Nick Penzenstadler doesn't have an obvious affiliation from his email, Brant Houston's email doesn't specify, and Lauren Mills is probably with IowaWatch. So I'll assign these accordingly.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE 2014 in San Francisco, so the conference key will be "IRE" and the year is 2014.

The title of the session is "Collaboration: Bringing students into your investigation."

For the description, it needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet discusses how newsrooms can collaborate with students on investigative projects, covering expectations from both editors and students, what to teach, avoiding errors, and examples of successful programs.

Now, keywords should be no more than five terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords could be "collaboration," "students," "investigation," "journalism education," and "project management."

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part accordingly, ensuring that affiliations are correctly noted where possible and that all values are in English as per the instructions.
