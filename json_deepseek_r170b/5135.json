Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has specified certain keys that must be included: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, I'll start with the `id`, which is provided as 5135. That's straightforward.

Next, the `authors` section. From the input, I see Paula Lavigne from ESPN. Her name, email, and affiliation are all present, so I can fill that in without any issues. There's no other author mentioned, so this list will have only one entry.

The `conference` is clearly stated as "IRE 2017", so I'll set the conference key to "IRE" since that's one of the allowed options (IRE, NICAR, Not Listed). 

For the `year`, since it's specified as 2017 in the input, that goes into the year field.

The `title` isn't explicitly mentioned in the tipsheet provided. However, based on the content, which focuses on investigative techniques and resources for reporters covering education topics, I can infer a suitable title like "Investigative Techniques for Education Reporting".

Moving on to the `description`, it needs to be a concise 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet covers methods for accessing information such as public records, student directories, financial documents, and ways to navigate FERPA limitations. So, I'll craft a summary that encapsulates these points.

Now, the `keywords`. They should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Reviewing the content, relevant keywords could be "public records", "student directories", "FERPA", "investigative reporting", and "education". These capture the essence of the tipsheet without overlapping with other keys.

I also need to ensure all values are in English, which they are, and that all keys and string values are enclosed in quotes. I'll structure each part accordingly, making sure there's no markdown formatting as per the user's instruction.

Putting it all together, I'll construct the JSON object with these components, ensuring proper syntax and formatting.
