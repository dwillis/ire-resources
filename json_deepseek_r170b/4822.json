Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The user provided specific instructions and an example response, so I should follow that structure closely.

First, let me parse the input given by the user. It's titled "Failures of Enforcement – IRE 2016" presented by Howard Berkes from NPR Investigations. The content is divided into six sections with various bullet points, each offering investigative strategies for assessing enforcement effectiveness.

The JSON keys required are: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. 

Starting with 'id', it should be 4822 as specified. 

Next, the 'authors' array needs to have elements with name, email, and affiliation. Howard Berkes is listed, but there's no email provided, so that field will be null. His affiliation is NPR Investigations since he works for NPR.

For 'conference', since it's an IRE event, that's straightforward. The year is clearly 2016. 

The title is "Failures of Enforcement – IRE 2016".

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet focuses on strategies for investigating enforcement agencies' effectiveness by examining records, data, and human impact.

Keywords should be no more than five terms. Looking at the content, relevant keywords include "enforcement," "investigative reporting," "accountability," "regulatory failures," and "data analysis."

Now, assembling all these parts into a JSON object while ensuring proper syntax and structure.
