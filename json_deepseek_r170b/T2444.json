Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's instructions. Let me start by understanding what each key requires.

First, the id should be "T2444". That's straightforward.

Next, authors is a list. Each author has name, email, and affiliation. The input mentions Michael Mansur from The Kansas City Star with his email. So I'll include him as an object in the authors array.

Conference: Looking at the text, it doesn't specify which conference this is from. The user mentioned options like "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Since there's no clear info, I'll set it to "Not Listed".

Year: Similarly, the input doesn't provide a specific year for the event, so year will also be "Not Listed".

Title: The main title is "Reporting on Property and Housing Issues", which fits perfectly.

Description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary. The text talks about using property records for investigative journalism, so I'll craft a concise summary highlighting that.

Keywords should be up to five terms. From the content, relevant keywords include "Property Records", "Housing Issues", "Investigative Journalism", "Government Transparency", and "Public Data". These capture the essence without overlapping with the conference or authors.

I think that covers all keys. Now, I'll structure it into JSON format, making sure each key is correctly quoted and values are appropriate.

  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Reporting on Property and Housing Issues",
  "description": "This tipsheet provides guidance on investigating property and housing issues, including accessing property records, understanding legal documents, and tracking delinquent taxes. It also covers housing programs funded by federal dollars.",
