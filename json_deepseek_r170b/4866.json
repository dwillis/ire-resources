Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the tipsheet provided from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each requirement step by step.

First, the id should be 4866 as given. 

Next, the authors section is a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. In the input, there's only one author listed: David Washburn from Voice of OC with his email provided. So I'll include him with his details.

The conference key needs to be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Since this is about campaign finance which is a common topic at IRE conferences, and the tipsheet format suggests it's from an IRE event, I'll set it to "IRE".

Looking for the year, the input doesn't specify when the conference took place. So I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

The title should be the main headline of the tipsheet, which is "Tips for Tracking Local Campaign Cash".

For the description, a concise 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet provides advice on tracking campaign finance at local levels, including laws, forms, and identifying red flags.

Keywords are up to five relevant terms. I'll extract key concepts like campaign finance, contributions, PACs (Political Action Committees), dark money, and money laundering as they're central to the content.

Putting it all together, ensuring each field is correctly formatted with quotes and proper structure.
