Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON, so I should follow them carefully.

First, looking at the input, the title of the session is "Working as a Team with a Photojournalist." The authors mentioned are Nancy Amons and Dave Brasells from WSMV-TV in Nashville. Since there's no email provided for either author, those fields will be null. Their affiliation is clearly stated as WSMV-TV, so I'll include that.

The conference is in San Francisco, but the specific event name isn't clear, though it's mentioned as an IRE conference in May/June 2002. So the conference field should be "IRE" and the year will be 2002. 

For the description, I need a concise summary of one or two sentences. The tipsheet emphasizes collaboration between reporters and photojournalists to improve storytelling through planning, communication, and production techniques like document presentation and stand-ups.

Next, keywords should include terms related to teamwork, photojournalism, and specific techniques mentioned, such as "collaboration," "photojournalist," "production techniques," "document presentation," and "stand-ups." I'll limit this to five relevant terms.

Putting it all together, I structure each key with the appropriate values. The id is given as T1714, so that's straightforward. Each author is an object within a list under authors. All other fields are filled accordingly without any markdown formatting.
