Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an IRE conference. Let's break down the input first.

The document starts with "INVESTIGATING LOCAL GOVERNMENT, IRE 2006" and lists Laure Quinlivan from WCPO-TV with her contact info. So, the authors should include her name, email, and affiliation as WCPO-TV.

The title is clearly "TIP SHEET FOR INVESTIGATING LOCAL GOVERNMENT". The conference is IRE, year is 2006. 

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet provides strategies for investigative reporting on local government, focusing on spending, accountability, and providing perspective through comparisons and expert interviews.

Keywords should be relevant terms without including the conference or authors. So, "local government", "investigative reporting", "spending", "accountability", and "public records" fit well.

I have to make sure all keys are in quotes and the structure is correct. No markdown, just plain JSON.
