Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tip sheet from Esther Kaplan at The Investigative Fund. Let me go through each requirement step by step.

First, the id is specified as "5659_3", so that's straightforward.

Next, authors. The text mentions Esther Kaplan as the editor, but there are no other names listed. So I'll create an authors array with one element. Her name is Esther Kaplan, and since her email isn't provided, it will be null. Her affiliation is clearly The Investigative Fund.

Moving on to conference. The tip sheet is from an IRE (Investigative Reporters and Editors) conference, so the conference key should be "IRE".

The year isn't mentioned in the text, so it defaults to "Not Listed".

For the title, I'll extract the main topic, which is about pitching guidelines for investigative stories.

The description needs a concise summary. The tip sheet explains what kinds of stories are commissioned and how reporters can pitch, so I'll phrase that into one or two sentences.

Keywords should be relevant terms excluding conference and authors. Appropriate keywords here would be "investigative reporting", "story pitches", "freelance journalism", "media partnerships", and "grant opportunities".

Putting it all together, the JSON structure should have each key properly filled with the extracted information.

  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Esther Kaplan",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "The Investigative Fund"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Pitching Guidelines for Investigative Stories",
  "description": "A tip sheet outlining what kinds of stories The Investigative Fund commissions, how to pitch effectively, and the support provided to reporters.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative reporting",
    "story pitches",
    "freelance journalism",
    "media partnerships",
    "grant opportunities"
  ]
