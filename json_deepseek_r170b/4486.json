Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. The input they provided is quite detailed with various sections including conferences, authors, descriptions, keywords, etc.

First, I should identify the required keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is given as 4486, so that's straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors. There are several names listed with emails and affiliations. For example, Bernice Yeung from Reveal has her contact info. I'll need to list each author with their details. If any author doesn't have an email or affiliation, those fields should be null.

The conference is specified as "IRE NATIONAL CONFERENCE", so the conference key will be "IRE". The year isn't explicitly mentioned, so it's "Not Listed".

For the title and description, I'll extract the main topic from the input. It seems to focus on pesticides in strawberry farming and their risks, so the title could reflect that. The description needs a concise summary.

Keywords should include terms like pesticides, strawberries, health risks, environmental impact, etc., but limited to five relevant ones.

I have to ensure all values are correctly formatted, with proper use of null where information isn't available. Also, making sure not to invent any data and keep everything in English as per the instructions.
