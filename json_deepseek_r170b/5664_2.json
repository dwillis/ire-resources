Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Cheryl W. Thompson. The user specified several keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, the ID is given as "5664_2", so that's straightforward.

For authors, I notice there's only one author mentioned, Cheryl W. Thompson. Her email isn't provided, and her affiliation is National Public Radio (NPR). So in the JSON, each author object should have name, email, and affiliation. Since there's no email listed, it will be null.

The conference is IRE because the tipsheet is from an Investigative Reporters and Editors conference.

The year is clearly stated as 2019.

The title of the tipsheet is "Interviewing Tips".

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The tips cover preparing for interviews, asking effective questions, note-taking, handling off-record information, building rapport, etc. So I can summarize that it offers practical advice on conducting effective interviews.

For keywords, I should pick up to five relevant terms excluding conference and authors. From the content: interviewing, preparation, note-taking, off-the-record, rapport-building. These seem appropriate.

Putting it all together, I structure each part into the JSON format with proper enclosures and syntax.

```json
{
  "id": "5664_2",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Cheryl W. Thompson",
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "National Public Radio - NPR"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2019,
  "title": "Interviewing Tips",
  "description": "A tipsheet offering practical advice on conducting effective interviews, including preparation, note-taking, and handling off-the-record information.",
  "keywords": [
    "interviewing",
    "preparation",
    "note-taking",
    "off-the-record",
    "rapport-building"
  ]
}
```
