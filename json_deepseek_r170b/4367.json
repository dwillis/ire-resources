Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors conferences. The user has given specific instructions, so let me go through each step carefully.

First, the id is set to 4367 as per the instruction. Now, looking at the authors section. The speaker's name is Peter Aldhous, and his email is peter@peteraldhous.com. There’s no explicit affiliation mentioned, but since he’s presenting at NICAR, which is associated with IRE, I can use that as his affiliation.

Next, the conference is clearly stated as NICAR 2015 in Atlanta, so I'll set conference to "NICAR" and year to 2015 because it's clearly listed. The title of the tipsheet is "Critical questions to ask of studies, press releases and scientific reports".

For the description, I need a concise summary. The document provides critical questions journalists should ask when evaluating studies or press releases, focusing on aspects like study type, funding sources, peer review status, and statistical significance. So I'll phrase it as: "A tipsheet providing critical questions to evaluate studies, press releases, and scientific reports, focusing on factors such as study design, funding sources, peer review, and statistical significance."

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Relevant keywords from the content are "study evaluation", "scientific reporting", "peer review", "statistical analysis", and "journalism". These capture the essence without overlapping with other sections.

I should ensure all values are in English and properly quoted. No need for any made-up names; everything is taken directly from the provided text.
