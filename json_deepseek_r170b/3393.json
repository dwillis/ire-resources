Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided specific instructions, so I have to make sure I follow them carefully.

First, the structure should include keys like id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is given as 3393, so that's straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors section. There's only one author mentioned: Kristen Lombardi. Her email and affiliation are provided, so I can fill those in. If there were multiple authors, each would have their own entry in the list with name, email, and affiliation. Since she's affiliated with The Center for Public Integrity, that goes into the affiliation field.

The conference is clearly stated as the 2010 IRE National Conference in Las Vegas, so the conference key should be "IRE". The year is 2010, which is explicitly mentioned, so that's easy to set.

For the title, the tipsheet is titled “Accountability Reporting in Higher Education”. That's a direct lift from the text. 

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary of the content. The tipsheet talks about investigating sexual assault on campuses and provides sources and methods for journalists. So, I can summarize that it offers strategies and resources for reporters covering campus sexual assault.

Keywords are limited to five terms. The main topics here are sexual assault, higher education, campus crimes, Title IX, and Clery Act. These capture the essence without overlapping with the conference or authors.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, since no other languages were involved, that's taken care of.

Putting it all together, I structure each key appropriately, making sure to handle lists and nulls where necessary. Since there's only one author, the authors list has a single object with her details.

Double-checking everything, I ensure there are no made-up names, and all data is accurately represented as per the instructions.
