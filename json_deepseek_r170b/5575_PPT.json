Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given me clear instructions on how each key should be populated.

First, the id is straightforward: "5575_PPT". 

Next, for authors, there are two people mentioned: Marisa Kwiatkowski and Mike Rezendes. Their emails and affiliations are provided. I'll list them as an array with their respective details. Each author object should have name, email, and affiliation.

The conference is clearly IRE since the document mentions it's from an IRE conference. 

The year isn't explicitly stated in the text, so I'll set that to "Not Listed".

For the title, looking at the tipsheet, it starts with "LUCKY 13 Tips for a good interview". So the main title is about tips for interviews.

The description needs to be a concise summary. It's about providing 13 tips on how journalists can conduct effective interviews with sources who might be reluctant or difficult.

Keywords should be relevant and up to five terms. I'll go with "interview techniques", "journalism tips", "source communication", "investigative reporting", and "media relations".

Putting it all together, I structure each part carefully, ensuring that the JSON syntax is correct and all keys are properly quoted.
