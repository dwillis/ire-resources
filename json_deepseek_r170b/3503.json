Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has provided specific instructions on how each part of the JSON should be structured.

First, I'll start by identifying all the necessary keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is set to 3503 as per the instruction. 

Looking at the content, the main author mentioned is Jackie Callaway, who works for WFTS-TV in Tampa. Her email and phone number are provided, so I can include those. There's no other author listed, so authors will be a list with just one entry.

The conference is clearly stated as the 2011 IRE National Conference, so the conference key is "IRE" and the year is 2011.

The title of the tipsheet is "Consumer Investigations Beyond the Obvious". 

For the description, I need to summarize the content in 1-2 sentences. The tipsheet focuses on sources like consumer attorneys and liquidators, online resources, and investigative ideas. So, I'll craft a concise summary highlighting these points.

Next, keywords should be up to five terms related to the content. I'll pick "consumer investigations", "sources", "online resources", "investigative journalism", and "tipsheet" as they capture the essence without including the conference or authors.

I need to ensure that all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. No made-up names, so any missing info like affiliation is left null if not provided.

Putting it all together, I structure each part carefully, ensuring the JSON syntax is correct with proper commas and brackets.
