Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The input includes various sections about digital threats to journalism, including topics like commercial spyware, phishing attempts, security culture, and more.

First, I'll start by identifying the id as "5666_2" since that's specified in the query. Next, for authors, Masashi NISHIHATA is listed with his affiliation as CITIZEN LAB at the University of Toronto. His email is provided, so I'll include that. There's no other author mentioned, so the authors list has only one entry.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, and the year is 2019 because the date May 4, 2019, is included in the input. The title of the tipsheet is "DIGITAL THREATS TO NEWSMAKING," which I'll use exactly as it appears.

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet covers various digital threats like spyware and phishing, so I'll mention those and touch on the importance of security culture in newsrooms to protect sources and information.

Keywords should be relevant and limited to five. I'll choose "digital security," "spyware," "phishing," "journalism threats," and "security culture" as they encapsulate the main topics discussed.

I need to ensure all values are enclosed in quotes and that there's no made-up data. Also, since the conference is specified as IRE and the year is clear, those fields are straightforward. The description needs to be simple and in English, so I'll keep it clear and direct.
