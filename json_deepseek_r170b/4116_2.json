Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on some input that's provided. The input seems to be a detailed description of a class or workshop about using QGIS for mapping, particularly focusing on handling lots of data points by using techniques like hexagonal binning.

First, I'll break down the requirements for the JSON structure. It needs to have keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

- **id**: This should be "4116_2". That's straightforward.
- **authors**: A list where each element has name, email, and affiliation. The instruction says not to make up names, so if the input doesn't list any authors, I leave them as null. Also, if a news organization is mentioned, use that as affiliation.
- **conference**: It should be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Looking at the input, it's about QGIS and mapping techniques, which might relate to NICAR since that's a conference for investigative reporters and data journalists. But I'm not entirely sure; maybe it's better to check if the original text mentions the conference.
- **year**: If the year isn't clearly stated, use "Not Listed". The input doesn't specify a year, so this should be "Not Listed".
- **title**: Needs to capture the main topic. The input is about mapping techniques with QGIS and hexagonal binning for handling many points, so maybe something like "Mapping Techniques with QGIS: Handling Large Datasets."
- **description**: A 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. It should explain that the class teaches using QGIS to manage large datasets through methods like hexagonal binning.
- **keywords**: Up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Possible keywords could be "QGIS", "Hexagonal Binning", "Data Mapping", "Geospatial Analysis", "Data Visualization".

Now, looking at the input text again, it's a class that covers QGIS tools for mapping, including hexagonal binning for handling numerous data points. There are no authors mentioned, so each author entry should have null for name, email, and affiliation.

The conference isn't explicitly stated, but since the content seems technical and related to data journalism, I'll tentatively assign it to "NICAR". However, if there's any uncertainty, perhaps it's safer to put "Not Listed".

Since no specific year is given in the input, I'll set the year as "Not Listed".

Putting this all together, I can structure the JSON accordingly.

```json
{
  "id": "4116_2",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Mapping Techniques with QGIS: Handling Large Datasets",
  "description": "This class teaches the use of QGIS for managing and visualizing large datasets, focusing on techniques like hexagonal binning.",
  "keywords": [
    "QGIS",
    "Hexagonal Binning",
    "Data Mapping",
    "Geospatial Analysis",
    "Data Visualization"
  ]
}
```
