Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to produce a JSON object based on their provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. They've given specific instructions on the keys to include: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, I need to parse the input they've given. The session is titled "How and why to make your data analysis reproducible," held on Thursday, March 8, from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. in Addison. The panelists are Hannah Cushman from DataMade, Ryann Grochowski Jones from ProPublica (moderator), Hannah Recht from Bloomberg News, and Jeremy Singer-Vine from BuzzFeed News.

The id is straightforward; the user specified it as 5373. Next, for authors, I need to list each panelist with their name, email, and affiliation. However, the input doesn't provide emails, so those will be null. Affiliations are clear from their positions: DataMade, ProPublica, Bloomberg News, BuzzFeed News.

The conference is mentioned as an IRE conference, so that's set to "IRE". The year isn't explicitly provided in the text, so according to instructions, it should be "Not Listed".

For the title, I'll use the session title exactly. The description needs a concise 1-2 sentence summary. I'll focus on the main points: the importance of reproducibility for editors and readers, standardized processes for data handling, and strategies for combining automation with human intervention.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords are "data analysis," "reproducibility," "journalism," "workflows," and "documentation."

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, since no year is given, that field will be "Not Listed". Finally, I'll structure this into a JSON object without any markdown or additional text, as per the user's request.
