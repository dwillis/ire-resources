Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, looking at the tipsheet content, I see it's titled "One journalist, multiple hats: A Tip Sheet on How to Do It All" and subtitled "How to Write, Shoot and Tweet a News Event Alone." There are several sections with bullet points about handling different aspects of reporting alone, tools for when you're shorthanded, quick ways to learn a beat, and how to own a beat.

The id should be 5628 as specified. For authors, the tipsheet doesn't list any specific names, so I'll set the name to null. The email and affiliation can also be null since there's no information provided about the authors.

Conference is clearly "IRE" because it's from an IRE event. The year isn't mentioned anywhere in the text, so it should be "Not Listed." 

The title is straightforward: "One journalist, multiple hats: A Tip Sheet on How to Do It All."

For the description, I need a concise 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet covers strategies for journalists handling multiple roles, including writing, photography, and social media, along with tools and techniques for efficient reporting. So the description could be: "Tips and strategies for journalists covering news events alone, including pre-writing context, using social media effectively, and leveraging tools for efficient reporting."

Keywords should be up to five relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, key topics include writing, photography, social media, journalism tools, and efficient reporting.

Putting it all together, I structure each part according to the keys, ensuring all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes.
