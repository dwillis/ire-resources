Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given memo from Kaas & Mulvad about using import.io for data journalism. Let me break down the requirements.

First, the id is fixed at 4693. Next, authors should be a list, but in the text, only "Kaas & Mulvad" are mentioned without emails or affiliations. So each author will have name as null, and email and affiliation as null too.

The conference isn't explicitly stated, so I'll set it to "Not Listed". The year is given as 11.03.2016, which translates to March 11, 2016, so the year is 2016.

For the title, it's clearly "import.io" from the header. The description needs a concise summary: import.io is a web scraping tool that allows data extraction without programming, useful for data journalism tasks.

Keywords should be relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. So I'll include "data journalism", "web scraping", "Import.io", "data extraction", and "automated scraping".

Putting it all together, I structure each key with proper values, ensuring everything is in English and enclosed in quotes.

```json
{
  "id": 4693,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": 2016,
  "title": "import.io",
  "description": "A tipsheet on using import.io for data journalism, covering basic and advanced web scraping techniques.",
  "keywords": [
    "data journalism",
    "web scraping",
    "Import.io",
    "data extraction",
    "automated scraping"
  ]
}
```
