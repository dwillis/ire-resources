Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors conferences. Let me go through this step by step.

First, looking at the input, there are two presenters: Frederica Freyberg from Wisconsin Public Television and Andy Hall from the Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism. Their presentation is titled "The Art of the Interview" and it's from a 2009 IRE conference.

I need to structure this into a JSON with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

- **id**: The user specified it as 3240_0.
- **authors**: Each should have name, email, affiliation. Since emails aren't provided, they'll be null. Affiliations are Wisconsin Public Television and Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism respectively.
- **conference**: It's clearly an IRE event.
- **year**: 2009 is mentioned.
- **title**: "The Art of the Interview".
- **description**: Needs to be a concise summary, maybe about effective interviewing techniques for journalists.
- **keywords**: Relevant terms like interview techniques, journalism, sources, etc.

I have to make sure all values are in English and properly enclosed. Also, no made-up names or data. Let me put this together now.
