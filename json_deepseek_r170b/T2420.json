Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's instructions from the given input. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, the JSON should have specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is set to "T2420". 

Next, looking at the input text, it seems like a list of contacts from various organizations related to trucking safety and industry associations. There are names, positions, phone numbers, emails, and websites provided.

The authors section requires a list where each element has name, email, and affiliation. I should extract these details from the input. For example, Jim Lewis is listed with a phone number but no email, so his entry will have name: "Jim Lewis", email: null, affiliation: "FMCSA". Similarly, Dick Henderson is from CVSA, so affiliation is there.

I need to go through each contact in the input and create an author object for each. If an email isn't provided, it stays null. Affiliation should be the organization they're part of, like FMCSA, CVSA, etc.

The conference key should be "Not Listed" since there's no indication this was part of a specific conference event. The year is also not mentioned, so that remains "Not Listed".

For the title and description, since it's a contacts list, I'll title it as such and write a brief summary in the description.

Keywords need to be up to five terms related to the content. Trucking safety, industry associations, contacts, organizations, and advocacy seem appropriate.

I also have to ensure all values are enclosed in quotes and that the JSON is correctly formatted without any markdown.
