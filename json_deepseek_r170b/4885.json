Alright, so I have to create a JSON object based on this tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the ID is given as 4885, that's straightforward.

Next, authors. The tipsheet has Dan Kane listed with his email and phone number. His affiliation isn't explicitly mentioned, but since he's a journalist, I can infer it's from a news organization. Looking at his email, it's @newsobserver.com, so his affiliation is "The News & Observer".

Now, the conference. It clearly says "IRE2016", so that translates to "IRE" for the conference field and the year is 2016.

The title of the tipsheet is "Investigating academic fraud in college sports – an IRE2016 tipsheet". That's clear enough.

For the description, it needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet provides methods for journalists to uncover academic fraud in college athletics, so I'll phrase it as tips and strategies for investigating such fraud.

Keywords should include relevant terms without being too broad. "Academic fraud", "college sports", "investigative journalism" seem appropriate. Also, including "athletes" and "transparency" captures the essence of the content.

Putting it all together, each field is filled out based on the information provided and the guidelines.
