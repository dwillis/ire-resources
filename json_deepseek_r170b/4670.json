Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, the id is straightforward—it's 4670 as specified. 

Next, authors: looking at the document, it mentions Jeremy and another person who isn't named. Since only "Jeremy" is mentioned without a last name or contact info, I'll set name to null for both entries. Email and affiliation can be null too because there’s no additional information provided.

Conference is clearly IRE since the tipsheet is from them.

Year: The document doesn’t specify the year of the conference, so it's "Not Listed".

Title should capture the essence, which seems to be about refactoring code into smaller functions. So something like "Refactoring Code 101" makes sense.

Description needs to be a concise summary. I'll go with explaining how breaking down big scripts improves readability and maintainability.

Keywords: Important terms from the text are Refactoring, Spaghetti Code, Code Smells, Modular Programming, and Software Design.

I think that covers all the required keys without missing any details.

```json

    },
    {

      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Refactoring Code 101",
  "description": "Learn how to break down large, complex scripts into smaller, manageable functions to improve code readability and maintainability.",
  "keywords": [
    "Refactoring",
