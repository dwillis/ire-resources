Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. Let me start by understanding what they're asking for.

First, the input provided seems to be a presentation or slides from an event related to investigative reporting or data journalism. The main sections include NICAR, SEC filings, and contacts with specific people like Brandon Quester.

The user wants a JSON object with keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is fixed as 4283. 

Looking for the authors section, I see Brandon Quester is listed with his email and affiliation. There's no other author mentioned, so authors will be a list containing one element.

Conference needs to be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Since the slides mention NICAR in the context of National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting, I'll set conference to "NICAR".

The year isn't explicitly stated, so it should be "Not Listed".

For title and description, the main focus is on business journalism resources and SEC filings. The description should be a brief summary.

Keywords are up to five terms. Relevant ones here are "business journalism", "investigative reporting", "SEC filings", "data journalism", "NICAR".

Now, I'll structure all these elements into the JSON object as specified.

```json
{
  "id": "4283",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Business Journalism Resources and SEC Filings",
  "description": "A presentation covering resources for business journalism, including SEC filings like 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K, as well as other investigative reporting tools.",
  "keywords": [
    "business journalism",
    "investigative reporting",
    "SEC filings",
    "data journalism",
    "NICAR"
  ]
}
```
