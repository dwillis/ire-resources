Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me first understand what they're asking for.

The user provided some content from a tipsheet titled "10 Databases For Covering City Hall" by David Herzog from NICAR & Missouri School of Journalism. They want this information structured into a specific JSON format with keys like id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, I need to extract the necessary details:

- **id**: The user specified it should be T1998.
- **authors**: There's only one author mentioned, David Herzog. His email isn't provided, so it'll be null. Affiliation is clearly NICAR & Missouri School of Journalism.
- **conference**: Since the tipsheet is from NICAR, which I know is associated with IRE, the conference key should be "NICAR".
- **year**: The original text doesn't mention a specific year, so it's set to "Not Listed".
- **title**: Clearly given as "10 Databases For Covering City Hall".
- **description**: Needs to be a concise summary. Looking at the content, it discusses various databases for investigating city government activities like personnel, payroll, pensions, etc. So I'll mention those aspects in 1-2 sentences.
- **keywords**: These should be relevant terms from the content but exclude the conference and authors. Possible keywords are "city hall", "databases", "government transparency", "public records", "investigative journalism".

I also need to make sure that all values are enclosed in quotes, and there's no markdown formatting. Each key must be properly quoted, and the structure should strictly follow JSON syntax.

Putting it all together, I'll ensure each field is accurately filled without any made-up information. Since the year isn't listed, it remains as "Not Listed". Emails and other missing info are null where necessary.
