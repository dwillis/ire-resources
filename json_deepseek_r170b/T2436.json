Alright, I need to figure out how to respond to this user query. They provided some slides from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference about investigating the police. The task is to create a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, I'll start by identifying each key's value based on the input. 

The id is given as T2436, so that's straightforward.

Looking at the authors section, there's only one author mentioned, David Migoya from The Denver Post. His name is provided, but there's no email or more detailed affiliation beyond the news organization, so I'll list him with his name and set email and affiliation to null since they aren't specified.

Next, the conference is clearly stated as "IRE" in the slides, so that goes into the conference key. The year isn't explicitly mentioned anywhere in the provided text, so I'll default to "Not Listed".

For the title, the main heading seems to be "Investigating the Police", which makes sense as a comprehensive title for this tipsheet.

The description needs to be a concise summary of 1-2 sentences. The slides talk about assessing basics like who police officers are and their actions, gathering information through records, lawsuits, and building databases. So I'll phrase it to capture that essence.

Finally, the keywords should include terms relevant to the content but exclude the conference and authors. From the slides, "police accountability", "public records", "internal investigations", "lawsuits", and "data journalism" seem appropriate as they cover the main points discussed.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with each key filled appropriately based on this analysis.
