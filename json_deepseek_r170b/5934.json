Okay, so I have this query where the user wants me to create a JSON object based on some tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The input provided is a transcript of a session titled "Make your business stories sing" with speakers Lauren Etter, Anupreeta Das, and Alison Young.

First, I need to parse through the content. Each slide seems to have different points about using anecdotes in business journalism. Lauren talks about what makes a good anecdote, like uniqueness and proximity. There's also mention of sources beyond the usual places, such as government grants or webinars.

The user wants a specific JSON structure with keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The ID is given as 5934. For authors, I need to list each speaker with their name, email, and affiliation. Emails aren't provided, so those will be null. Affiliations are the news organizations they're fromâ€”Bloomberg News, WSJ, and Missouri School of Journalism.

The conference is clearly IRE since it's mentioned in the header. The year isn't explicitly stated, but looking at the content, I see "June 2019," so the year is 2019. The title remains as given. 

For description, I have to summarize the session in one or two sentences. It focuses on using anecdotes and cultivating sources for business stories.

Keywords should be up to five terms. From the content, "anecdotes", "business journalism", "sources", "storytelling", and "investigative reporting" fit well.

I need to make sure all values are in English and properly quoted. No markdown, just a clean JSON object. I'll structure each part carefully to ensure it meets the user's specifications.
