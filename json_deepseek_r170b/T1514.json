Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to create this JSON object based on the user's query. Let me start by reading through their instructions carefully.

The user provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference titled "Digging for stories in the statehouse" by Holly A. Heyser. They want me to convert this into a specific JSON format with keys like id, authors, conference, year, etc.

First, I need to identify each key's value:

- **id**: The user specified it should be T1514.
- **authors**: This is a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. From the tipsheet, Holly A. Heyser is listed with her email and affiliation as the State government editor at St. Paul Pioneer Press and President of ACRE. So I'll include her details here.
- **conference**: Since it's from an IRE conference, this should be "IRE".
- **year**: The provided text doesn't mention the year, so I'll set it to "Not Listed".
- **title**: It's given as "Digging for stories in the statehouse".
- **description**: Needs a 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet talks about analyzing state finances by going beyond handouts and using raw data with spreadsheet skills.
- **keywords**: Up to five terms, excluding conference and authors. I'll choose relevant ones like budget analysis, campaign finance, data journalism.

Now, ensuring all values are in English and properly quoted. Double-checking each field for accuracy, especially the email and affiliation since they were provided. Also making sure the JSON structure is correct without any markdown formatting as per the user's request.
