Okay, I need to help create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me start by reading through the provided material carefully.

First, the title of the tipsheet is "Digging deep with data journalism" from NICAR 2013. So, I should note that down as the title. The id given in the example was 3836_tipsheet, so I'll keep that consistent.

Looking for authors, there's Jill Riepenhoff listed at the end with her email and affiliation from The Columbus Dispatch. Since she's the only author mentioned, I'll include her details. Her name is provided, along with email and affiliation, so those fields can be filled without issues.

The conference is clearly NICAR 2013, so that will go into the 'conference' field. The year is explicitly mentioned as 2013, so no problem there.

For the description, I need a concise summary of the content. The tipsheet seems to focus on using data journalism techniques for various story ideas like foreclosures, sports fans, education issues, etc. So I can summarize it as tips and resources for journalists to generate story ideas using data in areas like crime, education, and consumer issues.

Now, keywords are next. They should be no more than five terms excluding conference names or authors. From the content, relevant keywords could be "data journalism," "foreclosures," "FERPA," "youth sports," and "NCAA violations." These cover a broad range of topics discussed in the tipsheet.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with these values, ensuring each field is properly quoted and formatted. I should double-check that there are no typos or missing commas and that the structure aligns with the user's requirements.
