Alright, let's break this down step by step to create the required JSON object based on the user's query.

First, I need to parse the input provided, which includes two tipsheets from conferences: one about investigating special education by Brian M. Rosenthal of The New York Times and another on schools, disabilities, and abuse by Heather Vogell from ProPublica.

The user has specified that each JSON object should have the following keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. They also mentioned that if the information isn't available, certain fields like name, email, or affiliation can be null.

Starting with the first tipsheet:

1. **id**: The user assigns 5213 to this entry.
2. **authors**: Brian M. Rosenthal is listed with his Twitter handle but no email. His affiliation is The New York Times, so that's clear.
   - name: "Brian M. Rosenthal"
   - email: null
   - affiliation: "The New York Times"
3. **conference**: Since it's from an IRE event, the conference key is "IRE".
4. **year**: The year isn't specified in the input, so it defaults to "Not Listed".
5. **title**: The title provided is "Investigating Special Education".
6. **description**: A concise summary of the tipsheet content. It's about how to investigate special education systems, including abuse cases and holding institutions accountable.
7. **keywords**: Relevant terms are "special education", "abuse", "investigation", "accountability", "disabilities".

Moving on to the second tipsheet:

1. **id**: The user didn't specify a different id, but since they provided two, I need to assign another id. Let's say 5214 for this one.
2. **authors**: Heather Vogell is listed with her email and affiliation as ProPublica.
   - name: "Heather Vogell"
   - email: "heather.vogell@propublica.org"
   - affiliation: "ProPublica"
3. **conference**: This tipsheet doesn't mention the conference, so it's "Not Listed".
4. **year**: Again, no year is provided, so "Not Listed".
5. **title**: The title given is "Schools, Disabilities and Abuse".
6. **description**: Summarizes how to report on restraint and seclusion cases in schools, including examples like Carson Luke.
7. **keywords**: Terms include "disabilities", "abuse", "restraint", "seclusion", "investigation".

I need to ensure all values are correctly formatted with quotes and that there's no made-up data. Also, the description must be simple and within one or two sentences.

Finally, I'll structure both JSON objects accordingly, making sure each key is properly enclosed in quotes and that the overall syntax is correct.
