Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id is given as T1796. That's straightforward. Next, the authors section. The speaker listed is David Raynor, who is the Database Manager at The News & Observer. His email and phone number are provided, but since the JSON asks for authors with name, email, and affiliation, I can include his name, set email to null because it's not required unless explicitly mentioned, and use his affiliation as The News & Observer.

The conference is clearly stated as NICAR, held in Charlotte in March 2003. So the year is 2003. The title of the tipsheet is "Building and Analyzing Your Own Database."

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet provides guidance on when to build a database, examples from The News & Observer, and emphasizes quality control. So a possible sentence could be: "Tipsheet providing guidance on building and analyzing databases for investigative reporting, including examples and best practices."

Keywords should be no more than five terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords might include "database analysis," "investigative journalism," "data acquisition," "quality control," and "case studies." These capture the essence without overlapping with the conference or author details.

Putting it all together, I structure each part into the JSON format, ensuring all keys are enclosed in quotes and proper syntax is followed. I double-check to make sure there are no markdown elements and that everything aligns with the user's instructions.
