Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about tracking officer-involved shootings and national data issues. Let me break down what they provided.

First, the user wants a tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conferences. The main topic is the missing data in national sources regarding officer-involved shootings. They've listed three primary sources: FBI's UCR Data, CDC’s National Vital Statistics System, and BJS Death in Custody Reporting Program. Each has its own flaws.

Looking at the reporting findings, there are about 550 incidents missing over six years from the largest departments, with around 45% missing from the FBI data. Also, some large states like NY, FL, IL (except Chicago and Rockland) aren't reporting.

In the data descriptions, each source has specific issues—like CDC data not being agency-specific and including other legal interventions, BJS needing filtering for arrest-related deaths, and FBI's UCR having missing agencies or states.

The tipsheet suggests reporters go to local sources. It also mentions future improvements: NY and FL might start reporting again, a 2013 Act aimed at better federal stats, and media outlets tracking incidents.

I need to structure this into the JSON with keys id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The user specified ID as 4534, so that's set. Authors are tricky since none were listed; I'll leave them null. Conference is IRE, no specific year mentioned, so "Not Listed". Title should be concise, maybe the same as their heading: "Tracking Officer-Involved Shootings".

For description, a simple summary like missing data in national sources affecting tracking. Keywords will include officer-involved shootings, FBI UCR, CDC NVSS, BJS, underreporting.

I need to ensure all keys are in quotes and values properly formatted. I'll double-check each part against the user's instructions.
