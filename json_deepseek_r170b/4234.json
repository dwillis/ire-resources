Alright, let me try to figure this out. The user wants me to create a JSON object based on their query about an IRE conference tipsheet. They provided specific instructions on the structure with keys like id, authors, etc.

First, I need to extract all relevant information from their input. The title is "Campus Coverage: Sexual Assault and Other Crimes on Campus" by Walt Bogdanich, David Donald, Jill Riepenhoff, Samantha Sunne at IRE 2014. 

For the authors array, each should have name, email, and affiliation. Since emails aren't provided, they'll be null. Affiliations are tricky; Walt is from The New York Times, so I can fill that in for him. The others don't have affiliations listed, so those will be null.

The description needs to be a concise summary. I'll focus on the main points: strategies and sources for reporting on campus crimes despite authorities being tight-lipped.

Keywords should include up to five terms like sexual assault, Clery Act, FERPA, etc., avoiding duplicates and conference names.

I need to ensure all keys are in quotes and the structure is correct. I'll double-check each field to make sure nothing's missed.
