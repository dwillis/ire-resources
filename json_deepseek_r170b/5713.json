Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. The id is given as 5713, so that's straightforward.

Looking at the authors section, there are several mentions like Merrill College students, Injustice Watch staff, and PBS NewsHour. However, specific names aren't provided except for Lindsay Huth. So, I'll include her with her email and affiliation, and others will have nulls where info is missing.

The conference isn't explicitly stated as IRE or NICAR, so it's "Not Listed". The year also isn't mentioned, so that remains "Not Listed" too.

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet focuses on using court data to analyze plea bargains and includes examples from Baltimore Police corruption cases. So, the description should capture both the method and the application.

Keywords are up to five terms. Important ones here are "plea bargain system", "court records", "data analysis", "Baltimore Police corruption", and "criminal justice". These cover the main topics without including authors or conference names.

Putting it all together, I structure each part carefully ensuring all fields are correctly filled with available data and adhering to the user's instructions.
