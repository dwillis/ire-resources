Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The user provided a detailed breakdown of various resources categorized under topics like Aviation Accidents, Automobile/Trucks, Political Campaign Data, etc.

First, I'll start by identifying the required keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The ID is given as 4386. Next, the authors section needs to be a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. However, since the user mentioned not to make up names and to leave them as null if none are listed, I'll set each author's name to null. Affiliation will also be null unless specified otherwise.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE". The year isn't provided in the query, so it should be "Not Listed". For the title, the user provided "Where to Go When Breaking News Breaks", which seems appropriate. 

Now, the description needs to be a concise 1-2 sentence summary. Looking at the resources, they cover various incident types with multiple databases and websites. So, I'll craft something that highlights these aspects without being too wordy.

Keywords are next. They should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. The main topics from the query include Aviation Accidents, Automobile/Trucks, Political Campaign Data, Court System, Federal Spending, Crime/Punishment, Natural Disasters, Business Records, Non-Profits. I'll pick the most significant ones: "Aviation Accidents", "Automobile Accidents", "Political Campaign Data", "Crime Statistics", and "Natural Disasters".

I should ensure all keys are in English and enclosed in quotes. Since no specific year is mentioned, it stays as "Not Listed". Also, since there's no author information provided beyond what's already handled, the authors list remains with null values.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each key appropriately, making sure the JSON syntax is correct. Double-checking for any missing fields and ensuring that descriptions are clear yet brief.
