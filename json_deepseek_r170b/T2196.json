Okay, so I need to create a JSON object from the given tipsheet about covering organized crime. Let me break down the requirements.

First, the ID should be "T2196". Got that.

Authors are listed as Jason Kandel from Los Angeles Daily News with his email and phone number. Since there's only one author, the authors array will have one object with name, email, and affiliation.

Conference is clearly IRE since it's mentioned in the 2004 IRE Regional Conference.

The year is 2004, so that goes into the year field.

Title should be "TIPS FOR COVERING ORGANIZED CRIME".

For description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about investigating organized crime through sources and court coverage. So maybe something like: "Tips for journalists on investigating organized crime, including developing sources, tracking crime trends, and using public records."

Keywords should be relevant but not include the conference or authors. Possible keywords: organized crime, investigative journalism, sources, crime trends, public records.

Now, putting it all together into a JSON structure with proper formatting.

```json
{
  "id": "T2196",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Jason Kandel",
      "email": "jason.kandel@dailynews.com",
      "affiliation": "Los Angeles Daily News"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2004,
  "title": "TIPS FOR COVERING ORGANIZED CRIME",
  "description": "Tips for journalists on investigating organized crime, including developing sources, tracking crime trends, and using public records.",
  "keywords": [
    "organized crime",
    "investigative journalism",
    "sources",
    "crime trends",
    "public records"
  ]
}
```
