Alright, I need to help the user create a JSON object based on their query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The user has provided specific instructions on how to structure this JSON.

First, I'll look at the input they've given. It includes details about Blair Hickman from ProPublica, who presented at IRE 2014 with a session titled "Using Community to Power Investigative Reporting." My task is to extract relevant information and fit it into the required keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The ID should be 4163 as specified. For the authors section, each author needs a name, email, and affiliation. Blair Hickman's name is provided, along with her email and affiliation to ProPublica. Since only one author is listed, the authors array will have just this entry.

Next, the conference is clearly IRE, and the year is 2014. The title of the session is given as "Using Community to Power Investigative Reporting." Now, I need a brief description in simple language. The main idea here is about using community engagement for investigative reporting through various online platforms and tools like callouts and surveys.

For keywords, I should pick up to five terms that represent the content without including the conference or author names. Relevant terms from the text include "community engagement," "investigative reporting," "callouts," "crowdsourcing," and "online communities."

I need to make sure all values are in English unless specified otherwise and enclose everything in quotes as per JSON standards. Also, if any information isn't available, I should leave it null or omit it, but in this case, all necessary details are provided.

Putting it all together, the JSON structure will neatly organize each piece of extracted information under the correct keys. I must ensure there are no markdown formats and that everything is properly enclosed within curly braces and with correct syntax.

Double-checking each key to confirm accuracy: id 4163, authors correctly listed, conference set to "IRE," year as 2014, title accurately captured, a concise description, and relevant keywords. Everything seems in order.
