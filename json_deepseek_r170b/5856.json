Okay, so I need to create a JSON object from this input with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id should be 5856.

First, looking at the content provided. It's about doxxing prevention, covering topics like searching public records, using search engines and people search sites, setting up Google Alerts, removing personal info from data broker sites, securing social media accounts, monitoring for exposure, and additional resources like Have I Been Pwned and the Internet Archive.

The authors are listed as "None." Since no specific names are given, I'll leave the authors array empty. Each author entry should have name, email, and affiliation, but since there's none here, it stays null.

The conference isn't mentioned anywhere in the text, so I'll set that to "Not Listed". The year is also not provided, so that field will be "Not Listed" as well.

For the title, it's about preventing doxxing, so something like "Preventing Doxxing: A Guide to Protecting Personal Information Online".

The description needs to be a concise summary. Maybe: "This guide provides steps and resources to help individuals protect their personal information online and prevent doxxing."

Keywords should include relevant terms from the content: "doxxing prevention", "online privacy", "personal security", "data protection", "identity theft".

Putting it all together, I'll structure each key appropriately in JSON format.

```json
{
  "id": "5856",
  "authors": [],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Preventing Doxxing: A Guide to Protecting Personal Information Online",
  "description": "This guide provides steps and resources to help individuals protect their personal information online and prevent doxxing.",
  "keywords": ["doxxing prevention", "online privacy", "personal security", "data protection", "identity theft"]
}
```
