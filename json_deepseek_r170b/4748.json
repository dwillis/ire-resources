Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conferences. The user provided specific instructions on how to structure this JSON, so I have to follow them carefully.

First, the id is given as 4748, so that's straightforward. Next, for authors, I see that there are no specific names listed in the input text. Therefore, each author entry should have name set to null, and email and affiliation can also be null since there's no information provided about them.

The conference is clearly an IRE event because the tipsheet mentions it's from their conferences. So, the conference key will be "IRE". The year isn't mentioned in the input, so according to the instructions, it should be set to "Not Listed".

Now, the title of the tipsheet is about digital security tools for journalists, so I'll use something like "Digital Security Tools for Journalists" as the title. 

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet covers various encryption methods and privacy tools such as Tor, OTR, Signal, PGP, etc., with their pros and cons. So, the description could be: "A guide to digital security tools for journalists including Tor, encrypted messaging apps, and PGP."

Keywords should be no more than five terms related to the content. The main topics are encryption, privacy, Tor, secure communication, and journalism. I'll list these as keywords.

I have to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, make sure there's no made-up information; stick strictly to what's provided.

Putting it all together, I structure the JSON with the specified keys and fill in each part accordingly.

  "id": 4748,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Digital Security Tools for Journalists",
  "description": "A guide to digital security tools including Tor, encrypted messaging apps, and PGP for journalists.",
  "keywords": [
    "encryption",
    "privacy",
    "Tor",
    "secure communication",
    "journalism"
  ]
}
```
