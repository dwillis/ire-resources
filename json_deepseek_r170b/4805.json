Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's instructions from their query. Let me go through this step by step.

First, they provided a tipsheet with information about parking and government boards presented at an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The id should be 4805 as specified.

Looking at the authors section: Todd Wallack is listed with his email and affiliation to The Boston Globe. There's no other author mentioned, so I'll create a list with one entry containing his name, email, and affiliation.

The conference is clearly IRE since it's mentioned multiple times in the slides link. The year isn't explicitly stated, so I'll set that to "Not Listed".

For the title, both main topics are parking and government boards, so I'll combine them into a single title. The description should be concise, summarizing the tips for investigating parking systems and examining government boards.

Keywords need to be no more than five terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, parking tickets, permits, government transparency, and oversight make sense as relevant keywords.

I'll structure this information into the specified JSON format with each key properly enclosed in quotes and ensure all values are correctly formatted.
