Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON, with certain keys like id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, I'll start by identifying each component step by step.

1. **ID**: The user specified that the ID should be 4246. That's straightforward.

2. **Authors**: This is a list of objects, each with name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the input, there are three names mentioned: Lauren Asher, Holly Hacker, and Gordon Russell. 

   - For Lauren Asher, her affiliation is listed as "President, Institute for College Access & Success". Since no email is provided, it will be null.
   
   - Holly Hacker is affiliated with "The Dallas Morning News" as an Education Reporter. Again, no email, so null.
   
   - Gordon Russell's title is "Managing Editor/Investigations" at "The Advocate". No email here either.

3. **Conference**: The user mentioned it should be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Since this tipsheet is from an IRE conference, that's the value to use.

4. **Year**: The input doesn't specify a year, so according to instructions, it will be "Not Listed".

5. **Title**: The main title of the session is "Campus Coverage: Student Loans, Debt and Aid".

6. **Description**: This needs to be a concise 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. From the tipsheet content, it's about tools and resources for journalists covering student debt, including data sources, interactive maps, repayment plans, etc.

7. **Keywords**: These should be up to five relevant terms excluding conference and authors' names. Relevant keywords from the content are "student debt", "financial aid", "college affordability", "journalism resources", and "higher education data".

Now, putting it all together in JSON format, ensuring all keys and values are in quotes and proper structure is maintained.
