Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has specific instructions, so I'll go through each requirement step by step.

First, the id is given as 5175, which I'll include at the top level. Next, looking for authors, the tipsheet lists Andrew Perez with his email and affiliation to MapLight. So, the authors array will have one object with name "Andrew Perez", email "andrew@maplight.org", and affiliation "MapLight".

The conference is clearly stated as IRE 2017, so the conference key will be "IRE" and the year will be 2017. The title of the tipsheet is about tools for tracking dark money.

For the description, it needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers various resources and methods for investigating political funding, so I'll write that it provides tools and strategies to track dark money in politics.

Keywords should be up to five terms related to the content but excluding the conference and authors. Dark money, nonprofits, political finance, FEC, and 990 filings are all relevant here.

I also need to ensure all keys and values are in English and enclosed in quotes. I'll structure everything properly without any markdown, just a clean JSON object.

    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2017,
  "title": "Tools for tracking dark money",
  "description": "This tipsheet provides tools and strategies for investigating dark money in politics, including resources for tracking nonprofit funding and political expenditures.",
  "keywords": [
    "dark money",
    "nonprofits",
    "political finance",
    "FEC",
    "990 filings"
