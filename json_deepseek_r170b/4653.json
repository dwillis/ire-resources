Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference, specifically NICAR 2016. The user has provided detailed information about tracking government spending, including moderators, speakers, and various strategies for obtaining and analyzing data.

First, I'll break down the input to identify all necessary components:

1. **id**: The user specified that the id should be 4653.
2. **authors**: This is a list of people involved. Looking at the tipsheet, there are four individuals mentioned:
   - Nate Carlisle (moderator) from The Salt Lake Tribune with Twitter handle @natecarlisle.
   - Kate Martin from The News Tribune, @KateReports.
   - Colby Goodman, Director at Center for International Policy’s Security Assistance Monitor program, @cogoodman.
   - Lee Zurik from WVUE-TV in New Orleans, @leezurik.

   Since the user instructed not to make up names and only use what's provided, each author entry should have "name" as their full name if given. However, in this case, only first and last names are provided. The affiliations are clear from the text, so those will be filled in accordingly. Emails aren't provided, so they'll remain null.

3. **conference**: The tipsheet mentions NICAR 2016, so the conference is "NICAR".

4. **year**: Clearly stated as 2016.

5. **title**: The title given is "Tracking government spending, NICAR 2016". I can use this directly.

6. **description**: This needs to be a concise summary of the content in simple language. The tipsheet focuses on how journalists can track local and federal government expenditures by obtaining procurement databases and using USAspending.gov for federal data. It also suggests methods to analyze these datasets for investigative stories.

7. **keywords**: These should be relevant terms excluding conference and authors. Possible keywords are "government spending", "procurement database", "USAspending.gov", "investigative reporting".

Now, I'll structure this into a JSON object with the specified keys. Each key must be in quotes, and all values in English unless otherwise noted.

I need to ensure that:
- The authors list includes each person's name and affiliation correctly.
- Description is 1-2 sentences.
- Keywords are limited to five or fewer relevant terms.

Double-checking for any missing information: There are no emails provided, so they remain null. All affiliations are extracted from the text next to each author's name.

Putting it all together now.
