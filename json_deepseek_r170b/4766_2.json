Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. The query includes a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference, specifically NICAR2016 in Denver, CO, presented by Jonathan Stoneman.

First, I'll identify the required keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The id is given as 4766_2. 

For authors, the name is Jonathan Stoneman. Email and affiliation aren't provided, so they'll be null. Since he's presenting at an IRE event, his affiliation could be IRE, but since it's not explicitly mentioned, I'll leave it null.

The conference is NICAR, which falls under IRE events, so the conference key will be "NICAR". The year is clearly 2016 as it's part of NICAR2016.

The title should reflect the content. The tipsheet is about finding international data, so I'll use "Finding International Data" as the title.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The main points are using advanced Google search techniques and third-party sources for data collection in foreign countries. So, something like: "Tips on using advanced Google searches and third-party sources to find international data."

Keywords should include terms relevant but excluding the conference and author names. From the content, suitable keywords are "international data", "advanced Google search", "data portals", "social media", and "third-party sources".

Putting it all together, I'll structure each key appropriately in JSON format, ensuring correct syntax with quotation marks and proper nesting for authors as a list.

    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": 2016,
