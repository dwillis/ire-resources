Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's input. Let me start by reading through the query carefully.

The user provided a detailed passage about investigative journalism techniques, covering both nonprofit organizations and private companies. The focus is on using FOIA requests, federal and state agencies, and human sources. There are also specific examples like the shipbreaking industry investigation.

First, I need to extract the necessary information for each key in the JSON object. The id is given as 3516, so that's straightforward.

Next, the authors section. The text mentions Gary Cohn at the end with his email and affiliation. However, there are other names like Will Englund who contributed but aren't listed as authors. According to the instructions, I should only include authors explicitly mentioned. So, Gary Cohn is the sole author here.

For the conference key, the passage doesn't specify which event it's fromâ€”whether IRE, NICAR, or another. Since it's not clear, I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

The year isn't provided in the text, so that will also be "Not Listed".

The title should capture the essence of the content. The main topics are investigative techniques and strategies for covering nonprofits and private companies. So a suitable title would be something like "Investigative Techniques for Covering Nonprofits and Private Companies."

The description needs to be a concise summary in simple language. It should mention the focus areas: nonprofit organizations, private companies, FOIA requests, federal and state agencies, and human sources.

For keywords, I need up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Relevant keywords here would be "investigative journalism," "FOIA requests," "nonprofit organizations," "private companies," and "government agencies."

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON object with these extracted details.
