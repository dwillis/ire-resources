Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference about turning an investigation into a podcast. They want me to create a JSON object based on specific guidelines.

First, I need to identify the id, which is given as 4787. Easy enough. Next, authors. There's only one author listed: Gina Barton from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Since her email isn't provided, I'll leave it null. Affiliation is clear here, so that goes in too.

The conference is obviously "IRE" because it's mentioned right at the top. The year isn't specified anywhere in the text, so I'll mark that as "Not Listed". 

For the title, the main heading is "How to turn your investigation into a podcast", which is perfect. The description needs to be concise, summarizing the tipsheet. It should mention the key points like using audio tools and techniques for engaging storytelling.

Keywords are next. I'll extract relevant terms without including the conference or authors. Podcasting, audio production, investigative journalism, storytelling, and public records seem fitting as they cover the main topics.

Putting it all together, each element is placed into the JSON structure with proper formatting and enclosing quotes. I double-check to ensure all fields are correctly filled and that there are no made-up details.
