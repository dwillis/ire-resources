Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id is given as 3941, so that's straightforward. Next, for authors, the tipsheet mentions G.W. Schulz from the Center for Investigative Reporting. Thereâ€™s no email provided, so I'll leave it null. His affiliation is clear, so that goes in there too.

The conference is listed as IRE San Antonio, June 20-23. Since it's an IRE event, the conference key will be "IRE". The year isn't explicitly mentioned, but looking at the dates (June 2013), I can infer the year is 2013.

The title of the tipsheet is about border security and better project organization. For the description, I need a concise summary. It's about how organizing digital files helps manage large projects, using the border security example.

Keywords should be relevant and up to five. The main points are border security, project management, digital organization, investigative reporting, and documentation. These cover the key aspects without including the conference or authors.

Putting it all together, I structure each part into the JSON format as specified.

    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",

  "description": "This tipsheet discusses how to improve organizational skills using digital technology, focusing on managing information and maintaining clarity while working on large projects like border security investigations.",
  "keywords": [
    "border security",
    "project management",
