Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) 2015 National Conference. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with certain keys like id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, I'll look through the input text carefully. The title of the session is "Navigating the Publishing World: From eBooks to Your First Novel" presented by Kirsten Danis from The Wall Street Journal. Her contact info is also provided: email kirsten.danis@wsj.com and Twitter handle @kirstendanis.

The id should be 4481 as specified. For authors, it's a list of elements with name, email, and affiliation. Kirsten's name isn't null because she's listed. Her affiliation is The Wall Street Journal since that's her employer mentioned. Email is provided, so that goes in too.

Conference is IRE because the event is the IRE National Conference. Year is 2015, which is clearly stated. 

The title remains "Navigating the Publishing World: From eBooks to Your First Novel." For the description, it needs a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about turning reporting into an eBook, pros and cons, getting started, publishing details, and tips. So I'll summarize that it covers how journalists can create eBooks from their work.

Keywords should be no more than five terms excluding conference and authors. The relevant keywords here are "eBook", "publishing", "journalism", "reporting", and "long-form". These capture the essence without including the event or author names.

I need to make sure all values are in English, enclosed in quotes, and the JSON structure is correct with proper commas and braces. No markdown should be present in the final output, just a valid JSON object.
