Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions, so I should follow them carefully.

First, looking at the input, it's about dealing with blowback when investigating sacred cows in journalism. George Rodrigue from The Dallas Morning News presented this at the 2013 IRE conference in San Antonio, TX.

I need to extract certain information: id is given as 3945, authors should be a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. Since only George Rodrigue is mentioned, others are null. His affiliation is The Dallas Morning News.

The title isn't explicitly stated, but from the content, it's about dealing with blowback when investigating institutions like Parkland Memorial Hospital and UT Southwestern Medical Center.

For the description, I need a 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. It should capture how the investigation faced backlash and the importance of credibility.

Conference is IRE since it's explicitly mentioned as the 2013 IRE conference. The year is clearly 2013, so that's straightforward.

Keywords should be no more than five terms excluding the conference and authors. Relevant terms are blowback, sacred cows, institutional credibility, patient safety, media credibility.

I also need to make sure all keys are in English and enclosed in quotes. I'll structure the JSON accordingly without any markdown formatting.
