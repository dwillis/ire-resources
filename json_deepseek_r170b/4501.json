Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. They provided a detailed tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference about the ethics of sourcing.

First, the id is given as 4501, so that's straightforward. Next, the authors section requires each speaker with name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the text:

- David Boardman: Affiliated with Temple University.
- Margaret Sullivan: Public Editor at The New York Times.
- Aidan White: Director of Ethical Journalism Network.
- Wendy Ruderman: Reporter at Philadelphia Daily News.

Emails aren't provided, so they'll be null. Affiliations are based on the organizations mentioned next to their names.

The conference is clearly IRE since it's in the header. Year isn't specified, so it remains "Not Listed". The title is "THE ETHICS OF SOURCING", which is in all caps but needs to be properly cased as "The Ethics of Sourcing".

For the description, a concise summary: This tipsheet provides guidelines for journalists on handling sources ethically, including protection, anonymity, and attribution.

Keywords should be relevant and limited to five. From the content, I'll choose "ethics", "sourcing", "anonymity", "journalism", and "reporting".

Putting it all together in JSON format with proper syntax.
