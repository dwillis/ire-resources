Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conferences about using DocumentCloud.

First, I'll extract the necessary information:

- **id**: The user provided this as 3833.
  
- **authors**: There's only one author mentioned, Jaimi Dowdell. Her affiliation is listed as IRE/NICAR. So, her name isn't null, but email and other details are. Since it's not provided, they'll be null.

- **conference**: The tipsheet is from an IRE conference, so the conference key should be "IRE".

- **year**: The year of the event isn't specified in the text, so it will be "Not Listed".

- **title**: The title given is "Using DocumentCloud: A guide for reporters".

- **description**: Need a 1-2 sentence summary. It's about using DocumentCloud for managing and collaborating on documents in reporting.

- **keywords**: Important terms are DocumentCloud, collaboration, document management, reporting tools, journalism resources.

I'll structure this information into the JSON format as specified.
