Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from the NICAR16 conference. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, let me parse through the input to extract the necessary information. 

The ID is straightforward: it should be "4683_1" as specified. 

Looking at the tipsheet, there are panelists listed but no specific authors mentioned in the context of writing the tipsheet itself. The panelists are Erie Meyer from USDS, Lindsay Young from 18F, and Rebecca Williams from GovEx. However, since the user instructed not to make up names and only include authors if they're explicitly listed, I think it's appropriate to set the authors array to null because there are no authors credited with writing this tipsheet.

The conference is clearly NICAR16, so that goes into the "conference" field. The year isn't directly mentioned in the text provided, but NICAR16 would correspond to 2016 since conferences are usually annual and the 16 likely stands for 2016. So I'll put "2016" as the year.

The title of the tipsheet is given as "Behind the curtain: What open data looks like from within the government."

For the description, it needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet discusses open data policies and resources available to journalists, so I can summarize that by saying it's about open data within government and provides resources for journalists.

Keywords should be no more than five terms. From the content, relevant keywords would include "open data," "government," "journalists," "resources," and "transparency."

Putting all this together, each key is filled out with the appropriate information based on the provided text.

```json
{
  "id": "4683_1",
  "authors": null,
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "2016",
  "title": "Behind the curtain: What open data looks like from within the government",
  "description": "This tipsheet provides insights into open data policies and resources available to journalists, discussing federal and local open data policies, portals, and tools.",
  "keywords": ["open data", "government", "journalists", "resources", "transparency"]
}
```
