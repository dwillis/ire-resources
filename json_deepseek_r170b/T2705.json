Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given input. The user has provided specific instructions on what each key should contain. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the id is T2705 as specified. Now, looking at the authors section, it's a list where each element has name, email, and affiliation. In the input, I see "TIPS from Dianna Hunt, assistant government affairs editor, Fort Worth Star-Telegram DLHUNT@star-telegram.com (817) 390-7084." So the author is Dianna Hunt with her email and affiliation as Fort Worth Star-Telegram. Since there's only one author mentioned, the list will have one object.

Next, the conference key needs to be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". The input mentions it's from an IRE conference tipsheet, so I'll set it to "IRE".

The year isn't explicitly provided in the text, so according to instructions, it should be "Not Listed".

For the title, the main heading is "How to Cover Your Beat and Still Produce Investigative Stories", so that goes there.

The description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary. The input talks about managing a beat while producing investigative stories by paying attention to details, getting organized, and using resources effectively. So I'll condense that into two sentences.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords could be "investigative reporting", "beat reporting", "time management", "open records", and "journalism tips".

I should make sure all values are in English and enclosed in quotes. No need for additional keys or made-up data.

Double-checking each section to ensure compliance with the instructions. I think that's everything.
