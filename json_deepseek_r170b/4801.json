Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's instructions. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I'll read through the provided text to understand what it's about. It seems like a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference session titled "When Things Change Dramatically." The panel discusses handling unexpected developments in investigations, such as last-minute court settlements, sources becoming subjects, or reporters getting into legal trouble.

Next, I need to extract the necessary information for each key in the JSON object. 

- **id**: Should be 4801.
- **authors**: Need a list of authors with their name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the text, there are three panelists mentioned: Rick Yarborough from WRC-TV, Jodie Fleischer from WSB-TV, and Chris Nakamoto from WBRZ-TV. Their emails are provided, so I'll include those as well.
- **conference**: Since it's an IRE conference, this should be "IRE."
- **year**: The year isn't specified in the text, so I'll set it to "Not Listed."
- **title**: The session is titled "When Things Change Dramatically: Handling Unusual Developments in Investigations," but I can make it concise as per the example.
- **description**: A brief summary. It should mention dealing with unexpected issues like last-minute settlements, sources becoming subjects, and reporters facing legal actions, all while getting stories aired.
- **keywords**: Up to five terms. From the content, appropriate keywords could be "investigative journalism," "last-minute developments," "ethical considerations," "legal challenges," and "crisis management."

I also need to ensure that each key is properly formatted in JSON, with all values in English and enclosed in quotes. I should avoid making up any information and use null where necessary.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring that each part aligns with the user's instructions.
