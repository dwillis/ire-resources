Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's instructions. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the id is given as 3507, so that's straightforward. Next, for authors, there's Greg Borowski listed with his email and affiliation as Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. So the authors array will have one object with name "Greg Borowski", email "gborowski@journalsentinel.com", and affiliation "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel".

The conference is IRE since it's from an IRE conference in Orlando, Fla., so that goes into the conference key. The year is 2011 as mentioned in the text.

For the title, it should be the session title which is “Building a watchdog culture”.

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet is about building and maintaining a watchdog culture in newsrooms, especially under tight budgets. So I'll write that it provides strategies for managers to prioritize investigative journalism despite resource constraints.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference and authors. The main points are watchdog journalism, newsroom management, investigative reporting, priorities, resources, but since we need only five, I can choose the most relevant ones: "watchdog culture", "investigative journalism", "newsroom management".

Putting it all together, I'll structure each key appropriately ensuring correct syntax and quotation marks.
