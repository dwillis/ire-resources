Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The input provided includes slides from a presentation titled "The Data-Driven Story" by David Donald and Jennifer LaFleur at CAR 2014 in Baltimore.

First, I'll identify each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

1. **id**: Given as 4043.
2. **authors**: There are two speakers. Their names are provided, but emails and affiliations need to be extracted. David Donald is from The Center for Public Integrity, so his affiliation is clear. Jennifer LaFleur's email is listed, and her affiliation is the Center for Investigative Reporting (CIR).
3. **conference**: Since it's CAR 2014, which stands for Computer-Assisted Reporting conference, part of IRE events. So, conference is "IRE".
4. **year**: Clearly mentioned as 2014.
5. **title**: The title from the slides is "The Data-Driven Story (Pt 1)".
6. **description**: Needs a concise summary. The presentation covers steps in data-driven journalism: research, obtaining data, interviewing data, methodology, analysis, and pitching the story.
7. **keywords**: Relevant terms without including conference or authors. Possible keywords are "data journalism", "investigative reporting", "CAR conference", "research methods", "storytelling".

Now, I'll structure each part carefully:

- Authors: Each with name, email if available, affiliation from their respective organizations.
- Ensure the description is clear and within 1-2 sentences.
- Keywords are limited to five, relevant terms.

I should also make sure that all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. No markdown, just plain JSON.

Finally, I'll assemble everything into a valid JSON object without any errors.
