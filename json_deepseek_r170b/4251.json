Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided query. Let me go through this step by step.

First, the user wants a tipsheet from an IRE conference. The input includes details about an event titled "Reporting Immigration" held at IRE San Francisco in 2014. 

Looking at the structure required: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is given as 4251.

Next, for the authors section, it's a list where each entry has name, email, and affiliation. In the input, Zita Arocha is listed with her email and affiliation to borderzine.com. So I can include that. There are other presenters mentioned like Lise Olsen and Nina Kolodij, but since their emails aren't provided, I'll leave those fields as null.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's straightforward. The year is 2014, which is explicitly mentioned.

For the title, it's "Reporting Immigration". 

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers strategies for journalists reporting on immigration, including data sources and legislative updates. That makes sense.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. So I'll choose relevant terms like "immigration reporting", "data sources", "legislative updates", "journalism strategies".

I need to make sure all keys are in quotes and values as well, with proper JSON formatting. Also, avoid making up any information; if it's not provided, keep it null.

So putting it all together, the JSON structure should look like what I have below.

```json
{
  "id": 4251,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Zita Arocha",
      "email": "zarocha@utep.edu",
      "affiliation": "borderzine.com"
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": 2014,
  "title": "Reporting Immigration",
  "description": "This tipsheet provides guidance and resources for journalists covering immigration, including data sources, legislative updates, and reporting strategies.",
  "keywords": [
    "immigration reporting",
    "data sources",
    "legislative updates",
    "journalism strategies"
  ]
}
```
