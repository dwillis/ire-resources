Okay, so I'm trying to create a JSON object based on this tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors conference. The user provided specific instructions on how to structure it with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, the id is given as 4391, so that's straightforward. Next, I need to list all the authors. Looking at the tipsheet, there are four people mentioned:

- Thomas Hargrove from Scripps News
- John Perry from Atlanta Journal-Constitution
- Janet Roberts from Reuters
- Jennifer LaFleur from Reveal | The Center for Investigative Reporting

Each author should be an object with name, email, and affiliation. Since no emails are provided, those will be null. Their affiliations are the news organizations listed next to their names.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE 2015 CAR Conference in Atlanta, so the conference key is "IRE" and the year is 2015.

For the title, it's "Do integrity checks from your desk," which is repeated multiple times in the tipsheet. That makes sense as the main topic.

Now, the description needs to be a concise summary of the content. The tipsheet talks about checking data for duplicates, dates, statistical relevance, missing data patterns, and cross-verifying with other sources. So I'll condense that into a couple of sentences explaining it's about ensuring data accuracy through various checks before publication.

Keywords should include terms like "data integrity," "statistical analysis," "data verification," "journalism," and "investigative reporting." These capture the essence without mentioning the conference or authors specifically.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part carefully to ensure all keys are present and values are correctly formatted. Making sure emails and affiliations where not provided are null, and keeping everything in English as per instructions.
