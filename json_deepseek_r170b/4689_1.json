Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on this tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id is given as "4689_1". That's straightforward. Next, looking at the authors section, there's only one author mentioned. The name isn't explicitly provided, but I can see an email address: elizabeth.shell@gmail.com and a Twitter handle @elizabeth_shell. Since the name isn't listed, I'll leave it as null. The affiliation is CCTV America, which is the news organization she's associated with.

For the conference, since this came from IRE, that should be the value. The year isn't mentioned anywhere in the text, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed". 

The title of the tipsheet seems to be "Humanity through Numbers", which is highlighted at the top. Now, the description needs to be a concise summary. The main idea is about balancing data visualization with storytelling that highlights human elements, especially when dealing with sensitive topics like diversity.

Looking at the keywords, I'll extract relevant terms without including the conference or authors' names. "Data visualization", "storytelling", "empathy in journalism", "#OscarsSoWhite" (since it's a specific example used), and "D3" as a tool mentioned. That makes five keywords.

Putting it all together, I structure each part into the JSON format, ensuring proper syntax with quotation marks and commas where necessary.

    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Humanity through Numbers",
  "description": "The tipsheet emphasizes the importance of balancing data visualization with storytelling that highlights human elements, particularly in sensitive topics like diversity.",
  "keywords": [
