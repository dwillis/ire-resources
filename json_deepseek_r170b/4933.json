Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's input. The input includes details from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet about creating personalized interactive journalism.

First, let's break down what's needed:

- **id**: Should be 4933 as specified.
- **authors**: A list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. From the input, Sandeep Junnarkar is from CUNY Graduate School of Journalism and Scott Blumenthal is from The New York Times. Their emails are provided, so I can include those.
- **conference**: Since it's an IRE conference tipsheet, this should be "IRE".
- **year**: The input doesn't mention a specific year, so I'll set it to "Not Listed".
- **title**: Looking at the content, the main focus is on personalized interactive journalism, so I'll use that as the title.
- **description**: Needs to be 1-2 sentences. It should summarize how interactives help readers by showing their place in the news, prompting action, and generating empathy.
- **keywords**: Up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Key elements are personalized interactive journalism, engagement, decision-making, storytelling, and reader experience.

Now, I'll structure this into a JSON object with proper syntax and ensure all fields are correctly enclosed in quotes. Each author entry will have their respective details, and the description is concise.
