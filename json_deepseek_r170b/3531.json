Alright, so I'm trying to create this JSON object based on the user's query about an IRE Hands-On session regarding Tableau for public spending data. The user has provided specific instructions, so I need to unpack each part carefully.

First, they want a tipsheet from an IRE conference, which is clear because the input starts with "IRE Hands On:". That means the conference key should be set to "IRE". 

Next, looking at the content, the session is about using Tableau for public spending data. The title in the example was "Public Spending Data in Tableau", so that makes sense as the title.

Now, the authors are a bit tricky because the original text doesn't list any specific names. I have to leave the authors' name as null and set email and affiliation to null since there's no information provided about them.

For the description, it needs to be 1-2 sentences summarizing the session. The example given is "A hands-on session focused on using Tableau to analyze and visualize public spending data." That seems concise and accurate based on the input.

Keywords are next, and they should exclude the conference name and authors. From the content, relevant keywords could be ["Tableau", "public spending", "data analysis", "visualization"]. That's four terms which fit within the limit of five.

The id is specified as 3531, so that's straightforward. The year isn't mentioned in the input, so it should default to "Not Listed".

Putting this all together, I need to structure a JSON object with these keys: id, authors (as an array), conference, year, title, description, keywords.

I also have to ensure that all values are enclosed in quotes and that the syntax is correct. Since there are no authors listed, each author entry will have null for name, email, and affiliation.

Double-checking everything: id 3531, conference IRE, title as given, description summarizing the session, keywords relevant to the topic, year not listed, and authors empty because none were provided.

```json
{
  "id": 3531,
  "authors": [],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Public Spending Data in Tableau",
  "description": "A hands-on session focused on using Tableau to analyze and visualize public spending data.",
  "keywords": ["Tableau", "public spending", "data analysis", "visualization"]
}
```
