Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let's see what information I have here.

First, looking at the input, the title of the tipsheet is "School Performance Forever." The author mentioned is Marjan Agerbeek from The Netherlands. There's no email or additional affiliation beyond that, so I'll note that.

The conference isn't explicitly stated as IRE, NICAR, or another, but since it's about investigative reporting and mentions legal procedures using public information laws, it's safe to assume it's an IRE event. However, without a clear year in the text, I'll mark the year as "Not Listed."

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet talks about how a newspaper published school performance data, leading to various reactions and ongoing debates. So, the summary should capture that.

Keywords are next. They should be relevant and up to five. From the content, terms like "school performance," "public access," "data journalism," "education reporting," and "transparency" fit well.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each key as per the instructions, making sure authors is a list with one entry for Marjan Agerbeek. Since there's no email or more affiliations, those fields will be null.
