Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an IRE Conference tipsheet. Let me start by understanding what they're asking for.

First, the structure should have specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is given as 5945, so that's straightforward.

Looking at the input, there are three speakers: Axel Humlesjö, Roman Anin, and Anna Babinets. Each has their contact info like email and Signal numbers. I'll need to structure each author with name, email, and affiliation. Since affiliations are mentioned (like SVT, OCCRP), I'll include those. If there were no affiliations, I would leave them null or perhaps use the news org as affiliation if possible.

The conference is clearly stated as 2019 IRE Conference, so the year is 2019, and the conference type is "IRE".

For the title, it's given as "Dirty money, European banks and Russian organized crime". That fits well. The description needs to be a concise summary in simple terms. So, I'll mention investigating financial crimes involving European banks and Russian organized crime using open sources and tools.

Keywords should be up to five terms. From the content, "money laundering", "organized crime", "European banks", "financial investigations", and "open source research" are relevant and fit within the limit.

I need to make sure all values are in English unless otherwise specified. Also, ensure that each key is properly enclosed in quotes as per JSON standards.

Let me double-check for any missing info: All authors have names and some have emails and affiliations. The description accurately reflects the tipsheet's content without being too lengthy.

Finally, I'll structure everything into a JSON object with proper syntax, ensuring no markdown or additional text is included.
