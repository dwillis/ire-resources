Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Chase Davis's presentation at NICAR. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, the id should be _Chase_Davis_. Since that's given, it's straightforward.

Next, looking for authors. The text mentions "Chase Davis" and his handle @chasedavis is listed twice. There's no email or affiliation provided except maybe GitHub, but since it's a personal profile, I'll leave affiliation as null. So the author's name is "Chase Davis," with email and affiliation set to null.

The conference is NICAR because the GitHub link includes nicar2014. The year isn't explicitly stated, so I'll put "Not Listed" for that field.

The title of the tipsheet seems to be about algorithms in data journalism, specifically mentioning five algorithms. So I'll use "5 Algorithms in Data Journalism."

For the description, it's a 1-2 sentence summary. The presentation covers various algorithms like Vectorization, Na誰ve Bayes, etc., so I'll note that it introduces key algorithms used in data journalism.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. The algorithms mentioned are Vectorization, Na誰ve Bayes, Iterative Algorithms, Vantage Point Trees, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation. That's exactly five, so perfect.

Putting it all together into a JSON structure with each key properly filled out.

```json
{
  "id": "_Chase_Davis_",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "5 Algorithms in Data Journalism",
  "description": "A presentation introducing five key algorithms used in data journalism, including Vectorization, Na誰ve Bayes, Iterative Algorithms, Vantage Point Trees, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation.",
  "keywords": [
    "Vectorization",
    "Na誰ve Bayes",
    "Iterative Algorithms",
    "Vantage Point Trees",
    "Latent Dirichlet Allocation"
  ]
}
```
