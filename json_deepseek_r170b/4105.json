Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions, so I should follow them carefully.

First, let me parse through the input to extract all necessary information.

Looking at the first part:

- **Title:** "Cross-platform collaboration for data projects" is mentioned early on, which seems like the main topic.
  
- **Authors:**
  - Lorie Hearn from inewsource.
  - Josh Kleinbaum from NBC.
  - John Walton from BBC. Wait, the email provided later is josh.kleinbaum@nbcuni.com, so I can use that for Josh. For Lorie and John, there are no emails listed, so they should be null.

- **Conference:** The input mentions "inewsource" but more importantly, it's part of an IRE conference as per the user instruction, so conference is "IRE".

- **Year:** Not explicitly mentioned in the text. The example response used "Not Listed", so I'll stick with that.

- **Description:** Needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary. The main points are cross-platform collaboration for data projects, involving different media like TV, radio, and web. So something about how newsrooms can collaborate across platforms effectively using data storytelling techniques.

- **Keywords:** From the content, terms like "cross-platform", "data projects", "collaboration", "storytelling" come up. I should limit to five, so maybe "collaboration", "data projects", "multiplatform storytelling", "investigative journalism", and "media collaboration".

Putting it all together, I'll structure each section accordingly.

I need to make sure the JSON syntax is correct: keys in quotes, proper commas, etc. Also, ensure that authors are an array with their details, including affiliations where possible.
