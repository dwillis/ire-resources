Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user gave specific instructions on how to structure it with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I see that the ID should be 4590, which is straightforward. Next, looking at the authors section, there's a mention of Debra Juarez from NBC 5 Chicago. Her email isn't listed, so I'll leave it as null. The affiliation will be "NBC 5 Chicago" since she's affiliated with them.

The conference key needs to be either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Since the tipsheet is about managing an investigative broadcast team and includes elements like holding officials accountable and computer-assisted reporting, which are common in IRE conferences, it makes sense to categorize this under "IRE".

For the year, there's no specific mention of when the conference took place. The user mentioned that if the year isn't clearly identified, we should set it to "Not Listed", so I'll do that.

The title is given as "Managing the Investigative Broadcast Team". The description needs to be a concise summary of 1-2 sentences in simple language. The tipsheet covers creating mission statements, areas of focus, brand filters, processes for meetings and approvals, promotions, digital strategies, and collaboration. So I'll craft a sentence that encapsulates these points.

Keywords are limited to five terms, excluding the conference name and authors. Looking through the content, relevant keywords could be "Mission Statement", "Investigative Journalism", "Broadcast Management", "Digital Strategy", and "Accountability". These cover the main areas discussed without overlapping with the excluded terms.

Putting it all together, I need to ensure that each key is properly enclosed in quotes and the JSON structure is correct. No markdown should be included in the final output, just a clean JSON object.
