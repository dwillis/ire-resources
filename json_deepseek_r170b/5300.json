Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. Let me go through this step by step.

First, the input provided seems to be a presentation about mastering investigative interviews, given by Julian Sher. The id should be 5300 as specified.

Looking for authors: Only Julian Sher is mentioned with his email and affiliation at CBC. So the authors list will have one entry with name "Julian Sher", email "julian.sher@cbc.ca", and affiliation "CBC".

Next, the conference isn't explicitly stated, but since it's from IRE (Investigative Reporters & Editors), the conference key should be "IRE". The year is 2017, mentioned in the text.

The title of the presentation is about mastering investigative interviews. For the description, a brief summary would capture that it covers strategies and techniques for effective questioning.

Keywords should include relevant terms like Investigative Interviewing, Questioning Techniques, Journalism, IRE, and maybe something else from the context. But since the limit is five, I'll stick with those.

Putting it all together, ensuring each key is properly enclosed in quotes and the structure is correct.
