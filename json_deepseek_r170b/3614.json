Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The user provided detailed information from a 2012 CAR Conference in St. Louis, featuring Jim Miller and Mc Nelly Torres as authors.

First, I'll identify the key elements: id is given as 3614, so that goes directly into the JSON. The authors are listed with their names, emails, and affiliations. Since both have clear affiliations (The Press Enterprise and Florida Center for Investigative Reporting), those will be included.

Next, the conference name is "2012 CAR Conference", which falls under IRE events, so the conference key will be "IRE". The year is explicitly mentioned as 2012, so that's straightforward.

For the title, it should capture the essence of the session: "Using Government Data for Investigative Reporting" seems appropriate. The description needs to be a concise summaryâ€”maybe something about using government data sources for investigative journalism and including examples like education data and voter registration.

Keywords are limited to five, so I'll choose relevant terms like "government data", "investigative reporting", "CAR", "data analysis", and "journalism". These cover the main topics without overlapping with conference or author names.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Each key must be correctly spelled and structured as per JSON standards. Also, make sure there's no made-up data; everything should come directly from the provided text.
