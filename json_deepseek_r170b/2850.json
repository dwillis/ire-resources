Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conferences. The user has provided specific instructions on how to structure this JSON, including certain keys like id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, looking at the content of the tipsheet, it's all about splitting strings in MS Access and Excel with various examples and functions. I don't see any author names mentioned here, so the authors array will have elements with name set to null. Their email and affiliation are also not provided, so those will be null as well.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE" since it's from Investigative Reporters and Editors conferences. The year isn't specified in the text, so I'll put that as "Not Listed".

For the title, it should reflect what the tipsheet is about. Given it covers both MS Access and Excel functions for string splitting, a suitable title would be "Splitting Strings in MS Access and Excel."

The description needs to be a concise summary of 1-2 sentences. It's about providing examples and functions for splitting names, zip codes, phone numbers in both software applications.

Keywords should include terms like "string manipulation," "MS Access," "Excel," "functions," and maybe one more relevant term like "data processing." I'll make sure not to exceed five keywords.

I need to ensure all keys are properly quoted and the structure is correct. Since there's no author information, each author object in the array will have name, email, and affiliation as null.
