Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from the NICAR 2016 conference by Liz Lucas and Lisa Pickoff-White. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, I'll note that the id is given as 4619. The authors are Liz Lucas and Lisa Pickoff-White. Their emails and affiliations aren't provided in the text, so those will be null. The conference is NICAR, and the year is 2016 since it's mentioned as NICAR 2016.

The title of the tipsheet seems to be "Intro to CAR and the conference." For the description, I need a concise summary. It should cover that the tipsheet introduces CAR (Computer-Assisted Reporting) techniques and offers advice for navigating the conference effectively. That gives a clear overview in one sentence.

Next are the keywords. Looking through the text, the main topics include data journalism, CAR, NICAR conference, investigative reporting, and best practices. I'll list these as keywords, making sure not to exceed five terms.

I should ensure that all keys are enclosed in quotes and the JSON structure is correct. No markdown or extra formattingâ€”just plain JSON.
