Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, I'll start by identifying each component step by step. 

1. **id**: The user specified that it should be "5501_2". That's straightforward, so I just need to assign that value.

2. **authors**: This is a list of objects, each containing name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the input, there are three authors listed:
   - Alex Richards from NerdWallet with contact info.
   - Kristin Hussey, a freelancer with her contact info.
   - Mike Stucka from The Palm Beach Post.

   For each author, I'll extract their name, email, and affiliation. Since all have affiliations provided, I don't need to infer anything. Their emails are given as well, so those will be included.

3. **conference**: The input mentions it's from an IRE conference, so the value here is "IRE".

4. **year**: The input doesn't specify a year, so according to instructions, this should be "Not Listed".

5. **title**: The title of the tipsheet is clearly given as "How to avoid rookie data mistakes". 

6. **description**: This needs to be a concise summary in 1-2 sentences. I'll read through the content to get the main idea. It seems the session focuses on avoiding common mistakes when handling data, including requests, cleaning, analysis, and pre-publication checks.

7. **keywords**: These should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. Looking at the content, relevant keywords would include "data journalism", "FOIA", "data analysis", "investigative reporting", and "public records".

Now, putting it all together:

- Assign each value carefully, ensuring proper formatting with quotes.
- Make sure emails are correctly placed within the authors' objects.
- The description is concise and captures the essence of the session.

I think that's everything. I just need to structure this into a JSON object without any markdown, as per the user's request.
