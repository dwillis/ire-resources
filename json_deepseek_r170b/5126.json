Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has specified several keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, I'll start by assigning the id as 5126 since that's given in the query.

Next, for the authors section, it looks like there's only one author mentioned, Katelynn Rusnock. Her affiliation is Charity Navigator, which is a well-known organization, so I can use that. There’s no email provided, so that field will be null. Also, her name is clearly listed, so I don't need to leave anything as null.

The conference is specified as "IRE" because the document mentions it's from an IRE event.

Looking at the year, the tipsheet doesn’t provide a specific year, so I'll set it to "Not Listed".

For the title, the main heading is about digging into nonprofits, which seems appropriate.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers tools and best practices for investigating nonprofits using resources like Charity Navigator and understanding Form 990. So, I'll craft a brief sentence that captures this essence without getting too detailed.

Now, keywords. I need up to five relevant terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, "Nonprofits", "Form 990", "Charity Navigator", "Financial Health", and "Accountability" are all key topics covered. These make sense as they encapsulate the main points without overlap.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part carefully to ensure accuracy. No need for additional information or made-up data—stick strictly to what's provided.
