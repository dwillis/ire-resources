Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me break down the steps.

First, identify the id as 5564. Then, extract authors. There are two contacts: Nicole Dungca from The Boston Globe and Phillip Martin from WGBH. I'll structure them with name, email, and affiliation, even if some fields are null.

Next, determine the conference is "IRE" since it's mentioned in the link. The year is 2018 as given in the title. The title should be the same as provided: "Investigating Inequality // IRE 2018".

For description, I need a concise summary. It's about tools and data sources to explore inequality, so I'll write that it provides resources for investigating racial and economic disparities.

Keywords are important and up to five. I'll choose relevant terms like databases, inequality, race, ethnicity, and disparities.

Finally, ensure all fields are in English and properly enclosed in quotes without markdown.
