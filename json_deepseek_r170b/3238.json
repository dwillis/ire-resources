Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user has given me a block of text that seems to be about various ways to gather information for investigative journalism, specifically mentioning court records, federal agencies like the SEC, and other resources. They want me to create a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, I need to parse the input. The text doesn't mention any author names, so the authors array should have elements with name set to null. Since there's no email or affiliation provided either, those will also be null.

Next, the conference is likely "IRE" because the document starts with "Ways to..." which might be a tip-off, but I'm not entirely sure. The year isn't specified, so I'll put that as "Not Listed".

For the title, it's about methods or ways in investigative reporting, so something like "Ways to Investigate" makes sense.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The text talks about using court records and federal agencies for investigations, so I can summarize that it discusses various techniques using legal documents and government resources.

Keywords should include terms like "investigative journalism," "court records," "SEC," "PACER," as these are central topics in the text.

I need to make sure all keys are enclosed in quotes and the JSON structure is correct. Also, since there's no explicit title in the input, I have to infer it based on the content.

      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Ways to Investigate",
  "description": "A guide to investigative journalism techniques, including the use of court records and federal agencies.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative journalism",
    "court records",

    "PACER",
    "bankruptcy"
  ]
