Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about a tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conferences. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, the structure should include specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 4588. For the authors, it's a list where each entry has name, email, and affiliation. I notice Greg LeRoy is listed as the source with his contact info, so I'll include him.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, and the year is June 2015, so that's straightforward. The title of the tipsheet is provided in the input. Now, the description needs to be a concise summary of the content. I'll make sure it's 1-2 sentences explaining what the tipsheet covers.

Keywords should be up to five terms related to the topic but excluding the conference and authors. Looking at the content, "economic development subsidies," "subsidy tracking," "corporate accountability," "transparency," and "Good Jobs First" seem appropriate.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly quoted. No markdown, just plain JSON. I'll structure each part carefully, making sure not to miss any required fields or make up information where it's not provided.
