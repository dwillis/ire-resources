Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided query and data. Let me break down what's required.

First, the user wants an IRE tipsheet as a JSON response. The input includes details from a document presented at IRE 2018 by Jennifer Peebles. My task is to extract specific information like id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

The id should be "5637_2" as specified. For the authors section, I see that Jennifer Peebles is listed with her Twitter handle but no email or affiliation beyond her employer, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. So each author entry will have name, email (null here), and affiliation.

Conference is clearly IRE since it's an IRE 2018 tipsheet. Year is 2018 as mentioned in the document title. The title is straightforward: "Data sets every government reporter should have."

The description needs to be a concise summary. I'll mention that it lists essential datasets for reporters covering local government, including check registers and voter data.

Keywords are next. They mustn't exceed five terms and exclude conference names or authors. From the document, relevant keywords include datasets, government, reporting, transparency, and accountability.

Putting it all together, I structure each part carefully to ensure all fields meet the requirements without any made-up information.
