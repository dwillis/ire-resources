Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Ziva Branstetter at the IRE Conference in 2006. Let's break down each part step by step.

First, the id is given as T2690. Got that. Next, authors. The text mentions Ziva Branstetter from Tulsa World, and her email is listed. So, the authors array will have one object with name "Ziva Branstetter", email "ziva.branstetter@tulsaworld.com", and affiliation "Tulsa World".

The conference is clearly stated as IRE Conference 2006, so the conference key is "IRE" and year is 2006. The title isn't explicitly given, but looking at the content, it's about finding and obtaining data, so I'll use that as the title.

For the description, I need a concise summary. It's about five steps for reporters to find and obtain data, including preparation and overcoming roadblocks. So, something like: "A tipsheet outlining five steps for journalists to effectively locate and obtain electronic data for investigative reporting."

Keywords are next. The content mentions data, investigative journalism, CAR (which I know stands for Computer-Assisted Reporting), open records, and privacy. That's five relevant terms.

I should make sure all keys are in quotes and the structure is correct without any markdown formatting as per the user's request.
