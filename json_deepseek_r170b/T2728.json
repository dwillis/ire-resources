Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided input using specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The user also gave an example of what the expected output should look like. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the ID is given as T2728, so that's straightforward. Next, for the authors section, I need a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. In the input text, there's an author named Daniel Santoro from Diario "Clarín", Buenos Aires, Argentina, with his email provided. So I can fill in his details directly.

The conference is mentioned as IRE, so that goes into the conference key. The year isn't explicitly stated in the text, so it should be "Not Listed". The title is clearly given at the beginning of the speech: "Investigative Journalism in Latin America".

For the description, I need a concise summary. The main points are about the challenges and current state of investigative journalism in Latin America, including limited resources and threats against journalists.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking through the text, relevant keywords might include "Investigative Journalism", "Latin America", "Challenges", "Resources", and "Threats".

I need to make sure all values are enclosed in quotes and that the structure follows proper JSON syntax without any markdown. I should double-check each field to ensure accuracy, especially the email and affiliation for the author.

Finally, I'll assemble everything into a JSON object, ensuring it's correctly formatted with commas separating the keys and proper use of braces and brackets.
