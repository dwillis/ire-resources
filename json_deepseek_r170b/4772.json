Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from NICAR16 about Regular Expressions and OpenRefine. Let's break down each part step by step.

First, the id is given as 4772, so that's straightforward.

Looking at the authors section, there's only one author mentioned: Acton H. Gorton. His email is actongorton@gmail.com, and his affiliation is the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. So the authors array will have a single object with these details.

The conference is NICAR16, so that goes under "conference" as "NICAR". The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the text, but since it's NICAR16, I'll assume the year is 2016 and put that in the "year" field. If it were unclear, I might have used "Not Listed".

The title of the tipsheet is clearly stated as "Regular Expressions and OpenRefine #NICAR16", so that goes into the "title" key.

For the description, I need a concise summary. The tipsheet covers using regex for data cleaning and OpenRefine for processing police reports. So I'll write something like: "Tips on using regular expressions for data cleaning and OpenRefine for processing and analyzing police media reports."

Keywords should be no more than five terms related to the content, excluding the conference and authors. The main topics here are Regular Expressions, OpenRefine, Police Media Reports, Data Cleaning, and CartoDB (since it's mentioned in exporting data). That makes five keywords.

Putting it all together, I structure each part into the JSON format as specified.

      "affiliation": "University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": 2016,
  "title": "Regular Expressions and OpenRefine #NICAR16",
  "description": "Tips on using regular expressions for data cleaning and OpenRefine for processing police media reports.",
  "keywords": [
