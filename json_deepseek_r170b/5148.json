Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, the structure requires specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 5148, so that's straightforward.

Looking at the authors section, I need to list each author with name, email, and affiliation. In the provided text, Miranda Spivack is mentioned along with her email and Twitter handle, but no affiliation. So her entry will have null for affiliation. There are no other authors listed, so the array only includes her.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's set. The year isn't specified in the input, so it defaults to "Not Listed".

For the title and description, the main focus is on accessing public records without spending much money and complying with open meetings laws. So the title should reflect that, maybe something like "Digging for Data and Documents on a Budget". The description needs to be concise, summarizing how reporters can work with agencies efficiently.

Keywords are next. I'll extract relevant terms: "public records", "open meetings", "FOIA", "document requests", "investigative journalism".

I also need to ensure all values are in English and properly quoted. No made-up names, so if there's no info, it stays null or as specified.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, making sure each part aligns with the user's instructions.
