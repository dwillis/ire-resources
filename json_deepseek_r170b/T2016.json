Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. Let me see what they provided.

First, the input seems to be from a NICAR conference session about investigating business contributions through public records. The main speaker is Jesse Gaddis.

I have to extract id as T2016. Authors should be a list. Since only one author is mentioned, name will be "Jesse Gaddis", and email and affiliation are null because there's no info provided.

Conference is clearly NICAR. Year isn't given, so it'll be "Not Listed".

The title would be the session topic: "Investigating Business Contributions Through Public Records". Description needs to summarize the content in simple terms. Itâ€™s about using public records like corporate filings and property records to track political contributions from businesses.

Keywords should include the main topics discussed: ["public records", "business investigations", "political contributions", "corporate filings", "property records"].

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON accordingly.

```json
{
  "id": "T2016",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "NICAR",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Investigating Business Contributions Through Public Records",
  "description": "A session on using public records to track political contributions from businesses and individuals involved in business entities.",
  "keywords": ["public records", "business investigations", "political contributions"]
}
```
