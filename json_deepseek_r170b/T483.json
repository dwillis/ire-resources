Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON.

First, looking at the content, the main title is "A CAR Software Sampler: Boxplots, Crosstabs, Maps, Data Warehouses and the Internet." That should be the 'title' field in the JSON.

The guide mentioned is George Landau from the SL Loub Post-Dbatch. His email is glandau@pd.stlnet.com, and phone number is (314-340-8296). So under authors, there will be an object with name "George Landau", email as provided, and affiliation as "SL Loub Post-Dbatch".

The conference is likely IRE since the user mentioned it's from an IRE conference. The year isn't specified in the text, so 'year' should be "Not Listed".

For the description, I need a 1-2 sentence summary. The tipsheet covers various CAR tools like boxplots, crosstabs, maps, and setting up data warehouses with Microsoft SQL Server and NT. So summarizing that concisely.

Keywords are to be no more than five terms excluding conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords would be "CAR", "Boxplots", "Crosstabs", "Maps", "Data Warehouses".

Putting it all together, ensuring each key is in quotes and proper structure.
