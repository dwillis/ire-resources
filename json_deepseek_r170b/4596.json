Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The input provided includes details from a session titled "The Numbers Game: Finding stories in the data" at AAJA15, which is the Asian American Journalists Association 2015 conference.

First, I'll identify the id as 4596 since that's specified by the user. Next, looking for authors, I see Frank Bi from The Verge, Joanna Lin and Eric Sagara from The Center for Investigative Reporting. There are no emails mentioned, so those will be null. 

The conference is AAJA15, but the user wants it categorized as either "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". Since this isn't IRE or NICAR, it should be "Not Listed" for the conference field.

For the year, since AAJA15 indicates 2015, that's clear. The title is straightforward: "The Numbers Game: Finding stories in the data."

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet focuses on using data journalism techniques to find investigative stories by examining structured information and verifying its accuracy. So I'll write something about identifying patterns and ensuring data integrity.

Keywords should include relevant terms without mentioning the conference or authors. From the content, "data journalism," "investigative reporting," "structured data," "crime statistics," and "journalism techniques" seem appropriate.

Putting it all together, each part of the JSON is filled out with the extracted information, ensuring all fields are correctly formatted as per the user's instructions.
