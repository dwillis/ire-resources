Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through this step by step.

First, looking at the input, the title of the session is "Pulling off the Undercover Investigation" from the 2011 IRE Conference in Orlando, FL. The authors listed are Joel Grover, Cindy Galli, Angela Hill, and Andy Siegel, each with their respective affiliations: KNBC, ABC News, CNN, and KNBC again.

I need to structure this into a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 3548. 

For the authors, I'll create an array of objects, each containing name, email, and affiliation. Since emails aren't provided, they'll be null. Affiliations are clearly stated next to each author's name, so I can fill those in accordingly.

The conference is obviously "IRE" since it's an IRE event. The year is 2011, as mentioned. The title is straightforward: "Pulling off the Undercover Investigation."

Now, for the description, I need a concise summary of the session. It discusses best practices and legal considerations for undercover journalism, so I'll phrase that into a simple sentence.

Keywords should be relevant terms related to the content but not including the conference or authors. So, I'll choose "undercover investigation," "journalism ethics," "hidden cameras," "media law," and "investigative reporting."

Putting it all together, each part is filled out accurately based on the information given.
