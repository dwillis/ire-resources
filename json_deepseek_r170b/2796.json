Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided specific instructions with several keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, the id is straightforward—2796 as specified. 

Looking at the authors section, Megan Clarke is listed with her email and affiliation, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Since only one author is present, the authors array will have just one object with name, email, and affiliation filled in accordingly.

The conference is IRE because that's part of the original context given by the user. The year isn't provided anywhere in the text, so it should be "Not Listed".

For the title, the tipsheet is titled "Farming for Stories: How to use USDA data for agricultural projects". That makes sense as the main focus.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers using USDA data for investigative reporting on agriculture, including subsidies and fraud detection. So I'll phrase it to reflect that clearly in one or two sentences.

Keywords should capture the essence without being too broad. I'll choose "USDA data", "agricultural projects", "subsidies", "fraud detection", and "farm payments" as they're all central themes.

I need to ensure all values are enclosed in quotes, and there's no markdown or extra text—just a clean JSON object.
