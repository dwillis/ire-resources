Alright, I'm trying to create this JSON object based on the user's instructions. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, I need to set the id as 5206. That's straightforward.

Next, authors is a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. The user mentioned not to make up names and leave them as null if none are listed. Looking at the input, there are mentions of news organizations like NBC5, NBC Washington, etc., but no specific author names. So, I'll have to set name as null for each.

Emails aren't provided either, so those will be null too. For affiliation, since the text includes the news organizations, I'll use those as the affiliations. So, each author entry will have name: null, email: null, and affiliation: "NBC5" or similar.

The conference key needs to be "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". The input doesn't specify a conference, so it's safe to mark it as "Not Listed".

For the year, thereâ€™s no clear mention of when the event took place. So, year will also be "Not Listed".

The title should reflect the main topic. The broadcasts cover various investigative journalism pieces by NBC affiliates, so I'll name it something like "Broadcast: Investigative Journalism Examples from NBC Affiliates".

Description needs to be a concise summary. It's about how these investigations used public records to expose issues in government agencies and school systems.

Keywords should be up to five terms. They include things like investigative journalism, public records, government accountability, safety issues, financial scandals.

I need to structure all of this into JSON format with proper syntax, ensuring each key is enclosed in quotes and the values are correctly formatted. Let me double-check that I'm not missing any details or making up information where it's not provided.
