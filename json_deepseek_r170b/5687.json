Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, the structure requires specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The ID is given as 5687, so that's straightforward.

Looking at the authors section, Jessica Huseman is listed with her email and affiliation. Since she's from ProPublica, I'll note that as her affiliation. There are no other authors mentioned, so the list will have only one entry.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's set. The year isn't provided in the text, so it'll be "Not Listed".

For the title, the main heading is "Using data and records to investigate voting", which fits perfectly.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers using local election data, contacting officials, and resources for investigation. I'll condense that into one or two sentences.

Keywords should include relevant terms without repeating the conference or authors. I'll pick elections, voter fraud, election administration, voting data, and investigative reporting.

Putting it all together, I ensure each key is correctly formatted in English with proper quotation marks. No markdown, just plain JSON.
