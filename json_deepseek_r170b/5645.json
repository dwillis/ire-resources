Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about a tipsheet from an IRE conference. The user provided specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, I'll identify the id as 5645 since that was specified. Next, looking at the authors: Emily Le Coz, Nate Morabito, and Evan Wyloge. Their emails aren't listed, so those will be null. Affiliations aren't provided either, but their Twitter handles mention their names, so I'll leave affiliation as null.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE 2018, so the year is 2018. The title of the tipsheet is "HOW TO DO BIG PROJECTS IN A SMALL(ER) NEWSROOM".

For the description, I need a concise summary. The main idea is helping smaller newsrooms handle big projects, so something like "Tips and strategies for producing impactful investigative journalism in smaller newsrooms."

Keywords should be no more than five terms excluding conference and authors. Relevant terms include "investigative journalism", "small newsrooms", "collaboration tools", "data analysis", and "journalistic projects".

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with these elements, ensuring each key is properly quoted and values are in English.
