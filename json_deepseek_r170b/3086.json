Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an IRE Conference. Let me go through this step by step.

First, looking at the input, it starts with "IRE Conference" in June 2008. The panel is about investigating nonprofits and dissecting their tax returns. There's a speaker listed: Jacqueline Trescott, who's a reporter at The Washington Post, along with her contact info.

The specifics section has seven points. I need to extract the relevant information for each key in the JSON object.

1. **id**: It should be 3086 as specified.
2. **authors**: This is a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. There's only one author mentioned: Jacqueline Trescott. Her email is provided (trescottj@washpost.com), and her affiliation is The Washington Post. So the authors array will have one object with these details.
3. **conference**: Since it's clearly stated as "IRE Conference", that goes here.
4. **year**: The year is June 2008, so year is 2008.
5. **title**: The panel title is "Investigating Nonprofits And Dissecting Their Tax Returns".
6. **description**: Needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet provides methods for investigating nonprofits, including checking their financial structures, donors, and using FOIA. So the description could be: "Tips on investigating nonprofit organizations, including reviewing tax returns, identifying donors, and using public records."
7. **keywords**: Up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the specifics, relevant keywords might include "nonprofits", "tax returns", "FOIA", "donors", "financial investigations".

I should make sure that all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, no markdown is allowed in the final response, just a JSON object.

Wait, looking back at the authors section: Jacqueline's name is provided, so I can fill that in. Her email and affiliation are also there, so those shouldn't be null.

Putting it all together, the JSON structure should accurately reflect each key with the correct values.
