Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided specifications. The input given is a detailed tutorial on using QGIS for mapping, covering topics like hexagonal binning, data editing, and more.

First, the id should be "4116_1" as specified. Next, the authors section requires each author to have name, email, and affiliation. Since the text doesn't mention any authors, I'll set each element's name to null, and email and affiliation will also be null because there's no information provided.

The conference key should be determined by checking if it's "IRE", "NICAR", or "Not Listed". The input doesn't indicate a specific conference, so I'll set it to "Not Listed".

For the year, since the text doesn't provide a clear event year, I'll also mark it as "Not Listed".

The description needs to be a concise summary. I'll write that it's an introduction to QGIS tools like hexagonal binning and data editing for handling dense point data.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. I'll choose "QGIS", "Hexagonal Binning", "Data Editing", "Mapping Tools", and "Geospatial Analysis".

Putting it all together, each key is enclosed in quotes, and the structure follows the JSON format.

```json
{
  "id": "4116_1",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Mapping with QGIS: Hexagonal Binning and Data Editing",
  "description": "This tutorial provides an introduction to using QGIS for mapping, focusing on hexagonal binning and data editing techniques.",
  "keywords": [
    "QGIS",
    "Hexagonal Binning",
    "Data Editing",
    "Mapping Tools",
    "Geospatial Analysis"
  ]
}
