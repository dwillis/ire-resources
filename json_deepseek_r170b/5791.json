Alright, I'm trying to create a JSON object based on the user's query. They provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors conference, specifically #NICAR19. The title is about using DNS search for investigative journalism with Farsight Security.

First, I need to identify the id, which they've given as 5791. So that's straightforward. Next are the authors. Looking at the tipsheet, Dr. Paul Vixie from Farsight Security is listed as the presenter. His email and affiliation aren't provided, so I'll set them to null.

The conference is clearly NICAR since it's tagged with #NICAR19, and the year is 2019. The title should be concise, maybe "Finding the Story: Using DNS Search for Investigative Journalism." 

For the description, I need a 1-2 sentence summary. It should explain how DNS can help uncover digital trails and find relationships between domains and IPs.

Keywords are next. They should exclude conference and authors, so terms like DNS, investigative journalism, Farsight DNSDB make sense. Maybe also include Passive DNS since it's mentioned.

I need to structure all of this into a JSON object with the specified keys. Making sure each value is properly quoted and formatted.
