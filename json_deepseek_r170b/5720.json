Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's input using specific keys. The input includes a detailed query about creating this JSON with certain structure and constraints.

First, I'll start by identifying each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is given as 5720, so that's straightforward.

Next, for the authors, the user mentioned that each author should have name, email, and affiliation attributes. However, looking at the input provided, there are no specific names listed. So, I'll set each author's name to null. Emails and affiliations might also be missing, but since the text includes news organizations like Chalkbeat Indiana and Education Week, those will serve as affiliations if an author is mentioned without one.

Now, determining the conference. The input starts with "IRE Orlando:", which suggests that this entry is from the IRE (Investigative Reporters & Editors) conference in Orlando. So, the conference key should be set to "IRE".

The year isn't explicitly mentioned, so according to the instructions, it should default to "Not Listed".

For the title, the main heading seems to be about school choice and charters, as that's the primary focus of the input content.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The text covers various aspects of school choice, including vouchers, charter schools, oversight issues, and lobbying efforts by related companies. So, I'll craft a brief sentence that encapsulates these elements without being too detailed.

Keywords should be up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords would include "school choice", "charter schools", "vouchers", "lobbying", and "education policy".

I also need to ensure all values are in English unless specified otherwise, which they are here. All keys and string values must be enclosed in double quotes as per JSON standards.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, making sure each part aligns with the user's instructions.

```json
{
  "id": 5720,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "IRE Orlando"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "School Choice and Charters",
  "description": "A detailed examination of school choice policies, including charter schools and vouchers, with a focus on oversight and lobbying efforts.",
  "keywords": [
    "school choice",
    "charter schools",
    "vouchers",
    "lobbying",
    "education policy"
  ]
}
```
