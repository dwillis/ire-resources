Alright, I need to create a JSON object from the given tipsheet. Let's see what information I have.

First, the ID is provided as 2898, so that goes into the "id" field.

Looking at the authors section, Mark Walker is listed. His email and affiliation are both mentioned: mark.walker@nytimes.com and The New York Times, respectively. So, the authors array will have one object with these details.

The conference isn't explicitly stated, but since it's from Investigative Reporters and Editors, I'll set "conference" to "IRE".

The year isn't provided in the text, so I'll mark it as "Not Listed".

For the title, the tipsheet is titled "30 Public Records to Request Right Now", which fits perfectly.

Now, the description should be a concise summary. The tipsheet lists various public records journalists can request under FOIA and state laws, covering different areas like criminal justice and education. I'll condense that into a couple of sentences.

Keywords need to be relevant and no more than five. I'll choose "FOIA", "public records", "criminal justice", "education", and "government contracts" since they're prominent in the content.

Putting it all together, ensuring all keys are enclosed in quotes and values are correct.
