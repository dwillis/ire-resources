Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given input with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. Let me go through this step by step.

First, the id is straightforward; it's provided as 5308.

Next, looking at the authors. The text mentions Julian Sher and his contact info: julian.sher@cbc.ca. CBC is clearly a news organization, so that should be his affiliation. There are no other authors mentioned, so the list will only have one entry with name "Julian Sher", email as provided, and affiliation "CBC".

For conference, I need to determine if it's IRE, NICAR, or Not Listed. The input references ire.org in two places: once in the context of Tipsheets (2017) and again for a longer version (2016). So, this was likely presented at an IRE event.

The year is mentioned in the URLs as 2017 and 2016, but since the presentation seems to be from 2017 based on the first mention, I'll go with 2017. If it were unclear, I might have put "Not Listed", but here it's evident enough.

The title of the presentation is clearly stated as "The Art of Investigative Story-Telling".

For the description, I need a concise summary. The main points are about storytelling in investigative journalism, using characters' journeys and structure effectively. So, something like: "A presentation on effective storytelling techniques for investigative journalists, focusing on character development and narrative structure."

Keywords should be no more than five terms excluding conference and authors. Relevant terms here would be "investigative journalism", "storytelling", "character development", "narrative structure".

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with these details.

```json
{
  "id": "5308",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "Not Listed",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "The Art of Investigative Story-Telling",
  "description": "A presentation discussing techniques for effective storytelling in investigative journalism, including character development and narrative structure.",
  "keywords": [
    "investigative journalism",
    "storytelling",
    "character development",
    "narrative structure"
  ]
}
```
