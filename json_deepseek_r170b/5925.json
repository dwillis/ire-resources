Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's instructions from the given input about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the user provided a detailed tipsheet with various sections like "Follow the data trail," examples, criminal justice topics, public health, and more. The speakers mentioned are Andy Lehren from NBC News investigations at IRE Houston in June 2019.

I need to extract specific information for the JSON keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

1. **id**: The user specified it should be 5925.
2. **authors**: There's only one author mentioned, Andy Lehren. His email and affiliation aren't provided, so they'll be null. Since he's affiliated with NBC News, I'll note that under affiliation as "NBC News investigations."
3. **conference**: Clearly stated as IRE Houston, so conference is "IRE".
4. **year**: June 2019 is given, so year is 2019.
5. **title**: The main topic seems to be about using local data in investigative reporting. So the title could be "Using Local Data in Investigative Reporting."
6. **description**: Needs a concise summary. The tipsheet emphasizes following data trails, using primary and secondary sources, and applying document-based investigations to uncover truths. So, something like: "Tips on using local data, following document trails, and effective investigative techniques for impactful storytelling."
7. **keywords**: From the content, relevant keywords are "Local data," "Investigative reporting," "Document trails," "Primary sources," and "Storytelling."

I must ensure that all keys are in quotes, no markdown is used, and the JSON is properly formatted. I should also avoid making up any information and leave fields null if not provided.

Double-checking everything to make sure it aligns with the user's instructions and accurately represents the tipsheet content.
