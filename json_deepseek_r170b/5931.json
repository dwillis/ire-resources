Okay, I'm trying to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON.

First, I need to extract the necessary information. The id is already given as 5931, so that's straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors section. There are four speakers listed: Garance Burke from AP, Topher Sanders from ProPublica, and Perla Trevizo along with Susan Carroll, both from the Houston Chronicle. Each author should have their name, email, and affiliation. For emails, I see that each provides their contact info, so I'll include those. Affiliations are clear from their respective news organizations.

The conference is IRE19, which stands for Investigative Reporters and Editors 2019, so the conference field will be "IRE" and the year is 2019.

For the title, it's about using data to cover immigration, so I'll make that concise. The description needs a brief summaryâ€”maybe something like how journalists can use data and sources to investigate immigration stories effectively.

Keywords should include relevant terms without including the conference or authors' names. From the tipsheet, key topics are data journalism, immigration reporting, migrant children, foster care, and detention centers. I'll limit it to five.

I also need to ensure all values are in English and correctly formatted with quotes. No markdown, just plain JSON structure as per the instructions.
