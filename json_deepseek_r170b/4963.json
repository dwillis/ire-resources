Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the given query. Let me start by understanding what's being asked.

The user provided a tipsheet from Ellen Gabler of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel about requesting records under open records law. They want this information converted into a specific JSON structure with keys like id, authors, conference, year, etc.

First, I'll note that the ID should be 4963 as specified. The authors section is a list where each author has name, email, and affiliation. Ellen Gabler's email and affiliation are provided, so I can fill those in. There's no other author mentioned, so it's just her.

Next, determining the conference. Since the tipsheet doesn't mention NICAR or another specific event, I'll put "Not Listed" for the conference. The year is also not specified, so that remains "Not Listed".

The title should reflect the main topic, which is about requesting records under open records law. For the description, I need a concise summary of Ellen's tips on how to effectively request records by understanding what exists, crafting good requests, and overcoming denials.

Keywords are important for searchability. The main terms here would be "FOIA", "open records", "investigative reporting", "data journalism", and "government transparency". I'll list these without exceeding five terms.

I also need to ensure all keys and values are in English and properly quoted, with no markdown formatting. So the final JSON should have each key enclosed in quotes, and the structure correctly nested for authors.

Putting it all together, I'll format each part step by step to make sure everything is accurate and meets the user's specifications.
