Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an IRE Regional Conference in Savannah, GA, October 19-20, 2002. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with certain keys and requirements.

First, I'll start by identifying each required key: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. 

The id is straightforward; it's T1742 as specified.

Next, for the authors section, there's Alice Hart Wertheim listed with her email and affiliation. Her name isn't null because it's provided, so I'll include that along with her contact info. There are no other authors mentioned, so the list only has one entry.

The conference is clearly stated as an IRE Regional Conference, so I'll set that to "IRE". The year is also given as 2002, which I can include accurately.

For the title, the tipsheet is about General Journalism Resources with a focus on People Finding Sections, so I'll make that clear and concise.

The description needs to be a brief summary. The tipsheet provides various online resources for journalists to find people, including biography sites, public records, directories, etc. So, I'll condense that into one or two sentences highlighting the main purpose of the resource list.

Keywords are next. They should be up to five terms excluding conference and authors. Looking through the content, relevant keywords would include "people finding", "public records", "directories", "investigative journalism tools", and "biography research". These capture the essence without being too broad or narrow.

I need to ensure all values are in English and that keys and string values are enclosed in quotes. Also, the authors' details should be correctly structured with name, email, and affiliation, where applicable.

Let me double-check each part:
- id: T1742
- authors: Only Alice Hart Wertheim with her details.
- conference: IRE
- year: 2002
- title: General Journalism Resources with People Finding Sections
- description: A tipsheet from the IRE Regional Conference in Savannah, GA, providing resources for journalists to find information on individuals, including biography websites, public records databases, phone directories, and more.
- keywords: ["people finding", "public records", "directories", "investigative journalism tools", "biography research"]

Everything seems covered. Now, I'll structure it into JSON format as per the instructions.
