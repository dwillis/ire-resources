Okay, I need to create a JSON object from the provided input based on the user's instructions. Let me break down the steps.

First, the id should be 3608 as specified. The authors are a list where each element has name, email, and affiliation. Looking through the text, there are mentions of organizations like Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE), Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas, etc., but no specific author names provided. So, I'll set "name" to null for each author entry. Emails aren't listed either, so those will be null as well. Affiliations can use the news organization names mentioned.

The conference is determined by checking if the text refers to IRE, NICAR, or it's not listed. The input references IRE and other organizations but doesn't specify a particular event name. So, I'll set "conference" to "Not Listed". 

For the year, since there's no specific mention of when the conference took place, it will be "Not Listed".

The title needs to be a concise summary of the content. The text is a collection of resources for journalists covering immigration and borders, so I'll use that as the title.

The description should be 1-2 sentences in simple English. It's about providing contact info, websites, and other tools useful for reporting on these topics.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference and authors. The main themes here are immigration, border issues, journalism resources, contacts, and organizations.

I'll structure the JSON with all required keys, making sure each value is properly enclosed in quotes. No markdown formatting is needed since it's a plain JSON object.
