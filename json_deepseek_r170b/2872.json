Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given input about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. The user has provided specific instructions with several keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, the id is straightforwardâ€”it's 2872 as specified. 

Next, for authors, I see Maud Beelman listed with her email and affiliation to Associated Press. There's another mention of Steve Lovelady in the context of a rule he created, but it doesn't list his contact info or affiliation. So I'll include both, setting null where information isn't available.

The conference is clearly stated as "IRE". The year needs to be extracted from the text. Looking through the content, I don't see a specific year mentioned, so I'll default to "Not Listed".

The title should be concise, perhaps "Investigative Reporting Tipsheet" since it's about tips for investigative journalists.

For the description, it needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary in simple language. The tipsheet covers various techniques and strategies for effective investigative reporting.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding the conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords might include "investigative journalism", "reporting strategies", "research methods", "media ethics", and "journalistic practices".

I need to ensure all values are in English unless the original text is different, but since everything here is in English, that's fine.

Now, I'll structure this into a JSON object with proper syntax, making sure each key is enclosed in quotes and the structure is valid.
