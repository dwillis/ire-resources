Alright, so I need to help create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user provided specific instructions on how to structure this JSON, including certain keys like id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords.

First, I'll look at the input content to extract relevant information. The tipsheet is titled "Covering the big disaster (and quick-hit story ideas)" presented by Jaimi Dowdell from IRE. There's no specific year mentioned, so the year will be "Not Listed". The authors section needs to include each presenter with their name, email, and affiliation. However, in this case, only Jaimi Dowdell is listed without an email or affiliation beyond IRE.

Next, the description should be a concise summary of 1-2 sentences. The tipsheet focuses on preparing journalists for disasters and breaking news by using data resources and creative storytelling approaches. It also provides examples and quick-hit story ideas across various topics like payroll, lotteries, taxes, inspections, consumers, government, etc.

For keywords, I need to pick up to five terms that best represent the content. "Disaster reporting," "Breaking news," "Data journalism," "Investigative reporting," and "Story ideas" seem appropriate as they encapsulate the main themes without including the conference name or authors.

I should ensure all values are in English since the original text is, and structure each key properly with quotemarks. Also, making sure not to invent any information that's not provided, like leaving email and affiliation null where necessary.
