Alright, so I'm trying to help the user by creating a JSON object from their query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet on immigration data. Let me go through this step by step.

First, the user provided a detailed text with information about a workshop titled "Finding the Story: Immigration Data" at the 2018 IRE Conference in Orlando. The speaker was Angilee Shah from PRI's Global Nation. My task is to extract specific details and structure them into a JSON object as per their instructions.

The JSON should have keys like id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 5737. For the authors section, it needs to be a list where each entry has name, email, and affiliation. Since Angilee Shah is mentioned alongside her email and affiliation with PRI's Global Nation, I can fill that in without any issues.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's straightforward. The year is 2018 because the event took place then. The title of the workshop is "Finding the Story: Immigration Data," which I'll use verbatim.

For the description, it needs to be a concise summary. The workshop covers data sources and investigative techniques related to immigration policies, detention, prosecutions, and family separation. So, I'll craft a 1-2 sentence summary that captures these elements without getting too detailed.

Keywords are next. They should be no more than five terms excluding the conference name and authors. From the text, relevant keywords would include "immigration data," "investigative reporting," "border policies," "family separation," and "detention." These encapsulate the main topics discussed in the workshop.

I need to ensure that all values are enclosed in quotes and that there's no made-up information. Also, since the original text is in English, I'll keep everything in English unless specified otherwise.

Now, putting it all together, I structure each part carefully to make sure nothing is missed. Double-checking each field against the userâ€™s requirements ensures accuracy.
