Alright, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through this step by step.

First, looking at the input, it's from NICAR 2018, which is part of IRE. The main topic is a Journalism Educators Roundtable discussion. There are speakers listed: Mark Horvit and Mindy McAdams with their Twitter handles. 

The document includes resources like using Legos for data visualization, various syllabi, ideas such as escape room-style exercises, questions about programming languages in the curriculum, and courses from different universities.

Now, the JSON structure needs to have specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 5485. 

Authors should be a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. From the input, Mark Horvit and Mindy McAdams are mentioned without emails or affiliations beyond their Twitter handles. Since their affiliations aren't provided, I'll leave them as null.

The conference is clearly NICAR, which falls under IRE, so that's straightforward. The year is 2018 as it's NICAR 2018.

For the title, "Journalism Educators Roundtable" seems appropriate. 

The description should be a concise summary of the discussion: sharing resources and ideas for teaching data journalism.

Keywords are limited to five terms. From the content, I'll extract "data journalism", "education", "resources", "teaching tools", and "curriculum development".

Putting it all together, making sure each key is correctly formatted with quotes and proper nesting.
