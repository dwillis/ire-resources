Okay, so I'm trying to help create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE). Let me break down what needs to be done.

First, I need to extract specific information: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is already provided as 3412. 

Looking at the content, there are mentions of CNN Money and Seattle Times staff. However, no individual authors are named. So for authors, each entry should have name as null, email as null, and affiliation based on any news organization mentioned.

The conference is clearly IRE since it's an IRE tipsheet. The year isn't explicitly stated in the text, so it'll be "Not Listed".

The title seems to be "Introducing Tableau Public". For the description, a concise summary would be about using Tableau Public for interactive storytelling without programming.

Keywords should include terms like data visualization, interactive storytelling, Tableau Public, no-code tools, and journalism tools. These are relevant and exclude conference and authors as per instructions.

Putting it all together, I structure each part carefully to ensure all requirements are met.

```json
{
  "id": 3412,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "CNN Money"
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "Seattle Times"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Introducing Tableau Public",
  "description": "Learn how to use Tableau Public for interactive storytelling and data visualization without needing to code. The tool allows quick creation and publishing of visualizations online.",
  "keywords": [
    "data visualization",
    "interactive storytelling",
    "Tableau Public",
    "no-code tools",
    "journalism tools"
  ]
}
```
