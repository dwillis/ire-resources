Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference tipsheet. Let me start by understanding what they're asking for.

First, the user provided specific instructions. They want a JSON response with keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as 5608, so that's straightforward.

Looking at the input text, I see Michael J. Berens from Thomson Reuters is the author. There's no email or additional affiliation mentioned beyond Thomson Reuters, so those fields will be null except for his name and affiliation.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that key is set. The year isn't explicitly provided in the text, so I'll default to "Not Listed".

For the title, it's given as "Finding Sources with Data". The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet discusses using data strategies to identify story subjects, so I'll phrase it simply.

Keywords are next. They should exclude conference and authors but include relevant terms from the content. The text mentions data journalism, investigative reporting, sources, methadone, group homes. That's five keywords, perfect.

I need to ensure all keys and values are in English and properly quoted. No made-up names or emails; leave them null if not provided. Double-checking each field to make sure everything aligns with the user's instructions.

Alright, putting it all together now.
