Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from the Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions, so I should follow them carefully.

First, looking at the structure they want: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is 5642_2 as per their instruction. 

Next, the authors are Hilary Niles, Mc Nelly Torres, Cat Ferguson, and Samantha Sunne. I don't see any emails or affiliations listed for them in the tipsheet, so each author entry should have name as null since we shouldn't make up names. Emails and affiliations will also be null because there's no information provided.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE 2018 in Orlando, Florida, so conference is "IRE" and year is 2018. The title of the tipsheet is "The Freelance Investigation."

For the description, it needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers setting up a workspace, finding mentors, managing workflow, building relationships with editors, using grants, and taking breaks. So a good summary would mention these key points about freelancing in investigative journalism.

Keywords should be no more than five terms. Looking through the content, relevant keywords might be "freelance journalism," "investigative reporting," "workflow management," "grant funding," and "editor relationships." I need to make sure they're concise and capture the main topics.

I also have to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. No markdown, just plain JSON.

Double-checking everything: id is correct, authors are listed with nulls where info isn't available, conference and year are accurate, title is right, description is a clear summary, and keywords are relevant and within the limit.
