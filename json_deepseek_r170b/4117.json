Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me go through each key step by step.

First, the id is given as 4117, so that's straightforward.

Next, for authors, the original text doesn't mention any specific names. The presenters are from ProPublica, but without their names listed. So I'll set the name to null and the affiliation to "ProPublica". Email isn't provided either, so that remains null too.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's set under the conference key.

The year isn't explicitly mentioned in the text, so I'll default to "Not Listed".

For the title, it's "That 'Dam' Data: Counting and Summing with SQL + Amazing Puns", which captures the essence of the session.

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet focuses on using SQL for data analysis in journalism, particularly with aggregate functions like GROUP BY. So I'll phrase it to reflect learning how to analyze data effectively using SQL.

Keywords should be relevant and limited to five. The main topics are SQL, data analysis, journalism, dams (as the dataset used), and GROUP BY. These terms encapsulate the session's content without including the conference or authors.

Putting it all together, I structure each key with appropriate values, ensuring everything is in English and properly quoted as per JSON standards.

```json

  "id": 4117,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": "ProPublica"
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "That 'Dam' Data: Counting and Summing with SQL + Amazing Puns",
  "description": "A tipsheet on using SQL for data analysis in journalism, focusing on aggregate functions like GROUP BY to summarize and count records effectively.",
  "keywords": [
    "SQL",
    "data analysis",
    "journalism",
    "dams",
    "GROUP BY"
  ]
}
```
