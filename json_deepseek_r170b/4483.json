Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tip sheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this JSON with certain keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

First, I'll start by identifying each component. The id is given as 4483. That's straightforward.

Next, the authors section requires a list of objects, each containing name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the panelists:

- Dwayne Bray from ESPN, his email is provided.
- Brent Walth from Willamette Week, with his email.
- Gordon Witkin from the Center for Public Integrity, again with an email.
- Greg Borowski is listed as the moderator from Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

So each of these will become an author object. I'll set their names, emails, and affiliations accordingly. Since each has a clear affiliation, I can fill that in without issues.

The conference is explicitly stated as the 2015 IRE Conference in Philadelphia, so the conference key will be "IRE" and the year will be 2015.

The title of the tip sheet is "Guidelines for Producing Investigative Stories," which I need to extract from the content provided. 

For the description, I should write a concise summary. The tip sheet covers planning, researching, writing, editing, and follow-up strategies for investigative journalism projects. So, summarizing that into 1-2 sentences is key.

Keywords are next. They should be relevant terms excluding the conference name and authors. From the content, appropriate keywords might include "investigative journalism," "story production," "editing strategies," "research methods," and "media planning." I'll limit this to five terms as instructed.

Putting it all together, I structure each key with its corresponding value, ensuring that strings are in quotes and proper syntax is maintained. Also, making sure not to include any markdown or extra text outside the JSON object.

I think that covers everything the user asked for. Now, just need to format it correctly.
