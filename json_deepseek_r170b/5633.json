Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has provided detailed instructions, so let me go through them step by step.

First, the JSON should have specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is 5633 as specified. 

Looking at the input, there are three contacts listed: Nicole Dungca, Emmanuel Martinez, and Meghan Irons. Each has their name, email, and affiliation. I'll need to structure each author with these attributes. Even though one of them doesn't have an explicit affiliation mentioned right next to their name, since they're from The Boston Globe or Reveal, I can use those as affiliations.

The conference is clearly IRE 2018, so the year will be 2018. 

For the title, it's "Investigating Inequality." The description should be a concise summary of the tipsheet. It mentions various databases and methods for investigating inequality, so I'll craft a brief sentence capturing that.

Keywords are up to five terms excluding conference and authors. From the content, relevant keywords would be inequality, databases, race, ethnicity, and discrimination.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Each key must also be in quotes as per JSON standards.
