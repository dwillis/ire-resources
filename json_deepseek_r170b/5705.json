Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given specific instructions on what each key should contain.

First, the id is given as 5705. That's straightforward.

Next, for authors, it's a list of objects with name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the tipsheet, there are no author names mentioned. So each author object in the array will have null for name, email, and affiliation unless specified otherwise. Since there's no mention of any news organization or affiliations here, both email and affiliation remain null.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE 2018, so the conference key is "IRE". The year is also provided as 2018.

The title should be the session title, which is "Mapping in Excel with ArcGIS Maps for Office".

For the description, it needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet describes how to use ArcGIS Maps for Office within Excel to create maps and perform analysis without leaving Excel, offering hands-on experience. So I'll condense that into one or two sentences.

Keywords should be up to five terms related to the content but excluding conference and authors. From the text, relevant keywords are "Excel", "ArcGIS", "mapping", "data visualization", and "geoenrichment". These capture the main topics covered.

I need to ensure all values are in English as per the original text and that each key is enclosed in quotes. No markdown should be present in the final JSON object.
