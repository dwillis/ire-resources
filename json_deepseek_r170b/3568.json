Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given data. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the id is provided as 3568, so that's straightforward. Next, authors: there are two names mentioned, Tisha Thompson and Cheryl Phillips. Their emails or affiliations aren't directly listed, but I can infer their affiliations from the context. Tisha is with Fox TV, so her affiliation is "Fox TV." Cheryl doesn't have an explicit affiliation, so that field will be null for her.

The conference isn't explicitly mentioned as IRE, NICAR, or another, so I'll list it as "Not Listed." The year is also not provided in the text, so that remains "Not Listed" too. 

For the title, looking at the content, it's about data visualization examples and tips from an Investigative Reporters and Editors conference, so a suitable title would be "Data Visualization Examples and Tips."

The description needs to summarize the content in 1-2 sentences. It includes various data visualization tools and techniques used by different news organizations, along with tips on starting small and collaborating with designers.

Keywords should be relevant terms without including the conference or authors' names. So, I'll choose "data visualization," "tools," "mapping," "interactives," and "tips."

Putting it all together, each key is filled accordingly, ensuring that optional fields like email and affiliation are null where necessary.
