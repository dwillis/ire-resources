Alright, so I'm trying to help create a JSON object based on the given query. The user provided some tips from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference panel titled "First Day on the Beat: Covering Cops." They want this information structured into a specific JSON format with certain keys.

First, let me break down what's needed:

1. **id**: This is straightforwardâ€”just set it to 2980 as specified.
2. **authors**: I need to list each author with their name, email, and affiliation. Looking at the input, there are two authors: Ruth Teichroeb from Seattle Post-Intelligencer and Gina Barton from Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Their emails and affiliations are provided, so that's easy enough.
3. **conference**: The panel was part of IRE 2007, so the conference should be "IRE."
4. **year**: Clearly mentioned as 2007.
5. **title**: Given as "First Day on the Beat: Covering Cops."
6. **description**: Needs to be a concise summary. The tips are about investigative techniques for covering police, so I'll note that it provides strategies and tools for journalists.
7. **keywords**: Up to five terms. From the content, relevant keywords would include "police," "investigative reporting," "public records," "internal investigations," and "journalism tips."

I should ensure all keys are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, make sure not to add any extra information beyond what's provided.

Now, putting it all together step by step:

- Start with the id as 2980.
- For authors, create an array of objects. Each author object includes name, email, and affiliation. Both Ruth and Gina have their details provided, so fill those in accordingly.
- Set conference to "IRE," year to 2007, title as given.
- The description should succinctly capture the essence without being too lengthy.
- Keywords are selected based on the content's main themes.

I think that covers all the requirements. Let me double-check each field to make sure nothing is missed or incorrectly formatted.
