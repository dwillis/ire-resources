Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query. Let me read through their instructions carefully.

First, they provided a tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference about using drones for journalism. The response needs to be only a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

The user set the id as 3629. So I'll start by setting that.

Next, the authors section is a list where each element has name, email, and affiliation. Since no author names are listed in the text, all these will be null except for affiliation if possible. But since there's no news organization mentioned either, all three fields remain null.

Conference should be "IRE" as it's from an IRE conference. The year isn't clearly stated, so it'll be "Not Listed".

For the title, it's straightforward: "Drones for Journalism".

The description needs to be a 1-2 sentence summary in simple terms. So I'll write that drones are emerging tools but face challenges like cost and regulations.

Keywords should be no more than five, excluding conference and authors. From the text, relevant keywords are "drones", "journalism", "FAA", "ethics", and "safety".

I need to ensure all values are in English and enclosed in quotes. I think that's everything. Let me structure it properly.

```json
{
  "id": 3629,
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "email": null,
      "affiliation": null
    }
  ],
  "conference": "IRE",
  "year": "Not Listed",
  "title": "Drones for Journalism",
  "description": "A tipsheet discussing the potential use of drones in journalism, highlighting both the excitement and challenges.",
  "keywords": ["drones", "journalism", "FAA", "ethics", "safety"]
}
```
