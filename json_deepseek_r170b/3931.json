Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from Julia Angwin's presentation at an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has specified several keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords.

Starting with the ID, it should be 3931 as given. Next, for authors, I see only Julia Angwin is listed without any email or affiliation details, so her entry will have name "Julia Angwin" and null for email and affiliation.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE, so that's straightforward. The year isn't provided in the text, so it should be "Not Listed". 

For the title, the main heading is "Surveillance News Explained," which fits well. The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers government surveillance programs under the Patriot Act and Prism, collecting phone records and internet data for national security.

Keywords should include relevant terms without including the conference or authors. Key points are surveillance, Patriot Act Section 215, PRISM program, NSA, national security, and privacy concerns. I'll limit it to five: surveillance, Patriot Act Section 215, PRISM, NSA, and national security.

I need to structure all these into a JSON object with proper formatting, ensuring each key is enclosed in quotes and the values are correctly typed.
