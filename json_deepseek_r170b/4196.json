Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the user's query about an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) tipsheet from their 2014 conference titled "The Parched West: Covering Water and Drought." The user provided detailed information including authors, key points, resources, and specific formatting instructions. 

First, I'll start by identifying the required keys for the JSON object: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The ID is given as 4196. Next, I need to list the authors with their details. There are two authors mentioned: Lauren Sommer from KQED Public Radio and Matt Weiser from The Sacramento Bee. Their emails and affiliations are provided, so I can fill those in accordingly.

For the conference field, since this is an IRE event, it should be "IRE". The year is clearly stated as 2014, so that's straightforward. The title of the tipsheet is given, which I'll include exactly as it appears.

The description needs to be a concise summary in simple language. The tipsheet covers water and drought issues, emphasizing the economic aspects, infrastructure, climate change impacts, and storytelling approaches. I'll condense this into one or two sentences that capture the essence without getting too detailed.

Keywords are limited to five terms. Looking at the content, relevant keywords might include "water," "drought," "environment," "economy," and "infrastructure." These terms cover the main topics discussed in the tipsheet.

I'll make sure all values are enclosed in quotes and that there's no markdown formatting as per the user's instructions. The JSON structure should be clean, with each key properly assigned its value without any additional fluff or errors.
