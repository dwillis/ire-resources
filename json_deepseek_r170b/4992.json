Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tip sheet from Sandra Peddie's presentation at the IRE Watchdog Workshop. Let me break down what needs to be done step by step.

First, I'll start with the id, which is given as 4992. That part is straightforward.

Next, authors. The only author mentioned here is Sandra Peddie. She's an investigative reporter at Newsday, so her affiliation should be Newsday. There's no email provided for her in the tip sheet, so that will remain null.

Moving on to conference details. It was held at Stony Brook University on April 1, 2017. The workshop is part of IRE, so the conference field should be "IRE". The year is clearly stated as 2017, so that's filled in without issues.

The title of the tip sheet is given as "Tip Sheet on online records in NY".

For the description, it needs to be a concise summary. Sandra Peddie presented various resources for accessing public records in New York, covering courts, law enforcement, real estate, etc. So I'll craft a 1-2 sentence summary that captures this essence.

Keywords should include relevant terms without overlapping with the conference or authors. Looking at the content, "public records", "court records", "law enforcement", "real estate records", and "campaign finance" are all significant areas covered. I'll list these as keywords, making sure not to exceed five terms.

Putting it all together, I structure each part according to the specifications, ensuring that all keys and string values are in quotes and that any nulls are appropriately handled. This should result in a correctly formatted JSON object that accurately represents the provided tip sheet.
