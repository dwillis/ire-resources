Okay, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me break down what's given.

First, the header mentions Molly Young from The Oregonian/OregonLive presenting at NICAR 2018. So, the authors should include her name, but since there's no email or more affiliations beyond her news organization, I'll set email to null and affiliation to "The Oregonian/OregonLive".

The title of the tipsheet is about using social media for breaking news, specifically finding sources and background info quickly. The description needs a concise summaryâ€”maybe something like how journalists can use social media tools effectively in urgent situations.

Keywords should be relevant terms from the content: social media, breaking news, sources, witnesses, Facebook, Twitter. I'll limit it to five.

The conference is NICAR 2018, so that's straightforward. Year is clear as 2018.

Putting it all together, ensuring each field follows the instructions and structure correctly.
