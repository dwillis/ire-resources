Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user provided a chunk of text from IRE '08 and wants me to create a JSON object with specific keys. First, I need to parse the input to extract relevant information.

The id is given as 3142, so that's straightforward. Next, looking at the authors: Robert A. (Bob) Steele, Steve Doig, and Loretta Tofani. Their affiliations are The Poynter Institute, Arizona State University, and Salt Lake Tribune respectively. I'll list them in an array with their names and affiliations.

The conference is clearly stated as IRE '08, so the conference key is set to "IRE". The year is 2008, as indicated by '08. 

For the title, it's "IRE â€™08". The description needs to be a concise summary. The text focuses on improving investigative journalism through storytelling techniques and ethical considerations, so I'll phrase that into a couple of sentences.

Keywords should capture the essence without including conference or authors. Terms like "investigative reporting," "ethics," "storytelling," "journalism education," and "media ethics" fit well.

I also need to ensure all keys are in English and enclosed in quotes, avoiding any markdown. I'll structure the JSON accordingly, making sure each field aligns with the user's instructions.
