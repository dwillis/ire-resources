Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has specific instructions, so let me break it down step by step.

First, the structure requires id, authors, conference, year, title, description, and keywords. The id is given as 5152. That's straightforward.

Next, looking at the authors section. I see David Cuillier listed with his email and affiliation from the University of Arizona. There are other names mentioned like Ted Bridis from AP, but the user says not to make up names if they aren't listed. Since only David is clearly stated as the author, others might be speakers or contributors but not primary authors for this entry.

The conference is IRE, and the year is 2017 as per the date in the document. The title of the tipsheet is "Backyard Brawl: Fighting for open government in the age of Trumpania."

For the description, it should be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers challenges in accessing public records, strategies to overcome them, and mentions tools like FOIA Mapper and legal resources. So I'll craft a 1-2 sentence summary highlighting these points.

Keywords are next. They should exclude the conference and authors. From the content, relevant terms are open government, FOIA, public records, transparency, and investigative reporting. Keeping it to five as instructed.

I need to ensure all values are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. Also, no markdown, just plain JSON. Double-checking each field to make sure there's no missing information or errors.
