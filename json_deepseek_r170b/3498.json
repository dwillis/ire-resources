Alright, I need to create a JSON object based on the given tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has provided specific instructions on the structure, so let me break it down step by step.

First, the id is clearly given as 3498. Next, looking at the authors section: there's Michael Berens listed with his email and affiliation as The Seattle Times. Since there are no other authors mentioned, the list will only contain this one entry.

The conference location is Missoula, Mont., but the main organization is IRE, so the conference key should be "IRE". The year is March 2011, which is straightforward.

For the title, it's listed as "Project Checklist" under the IRE Watchdog / Montana 2011 section. The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet provides a checklist for enterprise projects, so I'll mention that and highlight its purpose as a guide for journalists.

Keywords should exclude conference and authors but include relevant terms from the content. Enterprise journalism, project planning, investigative reporting, reform, and storytelling all fit well here.

Putting it all together, ensuring each key is correctly populated with the right data types and constraints as per the instructions.
