Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to create a JSON object from their provided tipsheet. First, I'll read through the input carefully.

The title is "Useful International Online Databases" and it's presented at the IRE National Conference in New York City in 2000. The author listed is Noemí Ramírez with her email and affiliation as IRE and NICAR.

Next, I need to structure this into a JSON object with specific keys: id, authors, conference, year, title, description, keywords. The id is given as T1164. 

For the authors array, each entry should have name, email, and affiliation. Noemí's details are provided, so her entry will include all three. There’s no other author mentioned, so the array has only one element.

The conference is IRE since it's explicitly stated as the event location. The year is clearly 2000, so that goes into the year field. 

The description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet covers various databases for research, so I'll note that it helps journalists and researchers find international data sources.

Keywords should be up to five relevant terms. I'll choose "international databases," "research tools," "journalism resources," "data analysis," and "online resources" as they capture the essence without including conference or author names.

I need to ensure all keys are in English and properly enclosed in quotes. No values should be made up; if something isn't provided, it's left null. Here, everything seems covered except for any additional authors, which aren't present.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, making sure each part aligns with the user's instructions.
