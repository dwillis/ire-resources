Alright, I'm trying to help this user by creating a JSON object from their provided tipsheet. The query mentions it's from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. Let me see what information is given.

First, the authors listed are Sam Cohen, Lindsay Young, Derek Willis, and Matt Della Volpe. Their affiliations aren't explicitly mentioned, but since they're part of IRE, I can assume that's their affiliation unless stated otherwise.

The title is "Election APIs," so that goes into the JSON. The year isn't provided in the text, so it should be marked as "Not Listed." 

For the description, I need a concise summary. It's about using APIs for election data analysis, mentioning both FEC and AP Election API with examples.

Keywords are next. They should exclude conference names and authors. From the content, terms like "elections," "campaign finance," "FEC," "APIs," and "journalism" seem relevant.

I also need to ensure that all fields are correctly formatted in English, with proper quotation marks. Since the year isn't specified, I'll leave it as "Not Listed." Each author entry needs name, email, and affiliation, but emails aren't provided here, so those will be null.

Putting this together, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, making sure not to include any made-up information and keeping everything accurate based on the input.
