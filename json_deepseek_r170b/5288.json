Okay, so I need to create a JSON object based on the provided tipsheet from an Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference. The user has given me specific instructions on what each key should contain. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the id is straightforwardâ€”5288 as per the example. Next, authors: I see Arun Karki is listed with his Twitter handle but no email or affiliation beyond being the Director at Center for Data Journalism Nepal. So, his entry will have name: "Arun Karki", email: null, and affiliation: "Center for Data Journalism Nepal".

The conference is mentioned as #ire17, which I recognize as IRE 2017. So, the conference key should be "IRE" and the year is 2017.

For the title, the main topic is StoryMapJS, so that will be the title.

Description needs to be a concise summary. The tipsheet explains how to use StoryMapJS for creating interactive maps with locations and media, so I'll phrase it as a tool to tell location-based stories with customizable maps and media integration.

Keywords should include terms related to the content: "StoryMapJS", "dataviz", "mapping tool", "custom maps", and "interactive storytelling".

I also need to ensure all keys are in quotes and values are correctly formatted. No markdown, just plain JSON.
