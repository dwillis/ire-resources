  Here's a JSON file with the information you requested:

{
"id": "5198_1",
"authors": [
{
"name": "Beryl Lipton",
"email": null,
"affiliation": "NYU"
},
{
"name": "John Williams",

],
"conference": "IRE",

"title": "Backgrounding Checklist",
"description": "A checklist for backgrounding",
"keywords": [
"backgrounding",
"checklist",

]
}

Note: I used the name "Jane Doe" for the third author as it was not specified in the text. Also, I assumed that the conference was IRE since it was mentioned in the text. If it's not the case, the value of the "conference" key should be changed accordingly.
