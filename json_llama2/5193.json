"title": "Journalists, Sources, and Policy Outcomes: Insights from Three-Plus Decades of Investigative Reporting Contest Entries",
"description": "This study examines the relationship between journalists and sources in investigative reporting, using a random sample of 1,455 contest entries from 1979 to 2012. The study finds that enterprise reporting has increased over time, and that source tips are 1.7 times more likely to produce tangible results than assigned stories. The study also highlights the importance of public records laws and the growth of investigative reporting in the digital age.",
