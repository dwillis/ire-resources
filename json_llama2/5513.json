  Sure, here's a JSON object based on the provided text:

{
"id": 5513,
"authors": [
{
"name": "Steven Rich",
"email": "dataeditor@ire.org",
"affiliation": "IRE"
},
{
"name": "IRE Watchdog",
"email": null,
"affiliation": "IRE"
}
],
"conference": "IRE",
"year": "Not Listed",
"title": "Mass FOIA Requests (and how to do them better than me)",
"description": "A guide to submitting large numbers of Freedom of Information Act requests and effectively advocating for their release.",
"keywords": [
"FOIA",
"Freedom of Information Act",
"mass requests",
"government transparency",
"data journalism"
]
}

Note that I used the name "IRE Watchdog" for the second author, as it is mentioned in the text as a possible affiliation. Also, since the year of the event was not clearly identified, I set the value of "year" to "Not Listed".
