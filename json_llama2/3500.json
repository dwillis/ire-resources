"title": "Generating Investigative Story Ideas",
"description": "Tips, pre-reporting, and data are essential for investigative story ideas. A news story is a break in the daily pattern, while an investigative project is a pattern within those breaks. Pre-reporting can lead to nothing, and sources may not remain on-the-record, so it's vital to attack the architecture of the story idea before the editor does. The pitch memo should be written in story form, proving to the editor why citizens will care and why the story deviates from how things are supposed to work, with evidence, citing sources, and providing historical context. The structure of the story or how it would unfold should be outlined, and it should be clear why the time and resources should be provided to pursue the project.",
