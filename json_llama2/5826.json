"description": "A group calling itself the CyberCaliphate hacks the Albuquerque Journal, defacing the newspaper’s website, and spreading an ominous message about ISIS terrorists living among us, and the government being unable to provide security. But news of the hack has spread, and the CyberCaliphate goes on to hack other targets, including the U.S. military’s Central Command Twitter account. It's not ISIS, but Russia's military intelligence service, according to British intelligence. The story highlights the challenges of reporting on nation-state hacking, and the importance of talking to people and using tools and techniques to piece things together.",
