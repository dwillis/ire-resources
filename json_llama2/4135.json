  Sure, here's the JSON object based on the provided text:

{
"id": 4135,
"authors": [
{
"name": "Ronald Campbell",
"email": "campbellr@verizon.net",
"affiliation": "Journalists"
}
],
"conference": "Not Listed",
"year": "Not Listed",
"title": "The Hidden Key to Hot Button Issues: Census Data",
"description": "Journalists often use Census data to find facts for controversial issues. This article highlights 10 examples of hot button issues and the corresponding Census datasets and tables to use for each issue.",
"keywords": [
"Census data",
"hot button issues",
"journalism",
"demographics",
"statistics"
]
}

Note that I used the name "Ronald Campbell" for the author since it was provided in the text, and set the affiliation to "Journalists" since it wasn't explicitly stated. The conference and year were not explicitly stated, so I set those values to "Not Listed". The title, description, and keywords were derived from the text. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!
