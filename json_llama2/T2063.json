"description": "The Orange County Register spent two years investigating the dangers of Mexican candy, testing ingredients and candy samples, and collecting samples from a Mexican village where pots are made to hold tamarind candies. The investigation found dangerous levels of lead in candy, with most coming from Mexico, and children in the village having elevated levels of lead. The report explains how the testing was done and what was found.",
