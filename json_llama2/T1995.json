"description": "An investigation into the Jan. 8, 2003, crash of U.S. Airways Express Flight 5481, which killed all 21 aboard, reveals that airline maintenance appeared as a likely cause. The article examines the issue of airline maintenance and safety, citing data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and other sources to demonstrate that maintenance problems have contributed to 42% of fatal airline accidents in the U.S. since 1994, including three of the past five fatal airline crashes. The article also discusses the lack of attention paid to maintenance issues and the need for more oversight and action to prevent future tragedies.",
