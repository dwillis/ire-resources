But are we developing models of collaboration that recreate -- rather than challenge \u2013 historic power imbalances between journalists in the Global South and Global North? \n\nInternational journalism has a long history of extractive practices, from exploiting \u201cfixers\u201d to failing to credit local outlets. But even the most well-intentioned global collaborations can fall into some of the same patterns. \n\nWe will convene a frank, off-the-record discussion between editors and project managers about equity and inclusion in cross-border investigations. Facilitated by Lighthouse Reports editors working on collaborations in Mexico, Afghanistan and Syria, we will discuss practical steps the industry can take to create more inclusive cross-border collaborations.",

    "description": "This session explains how reporters can search for pending legislation in any state \u2013 or across the country \u2013 through a new tool developed with journalists in mind. This bill tracker, provided through Big Local News in partnership with BillTrack50, allows journalists to search for bills by topic. The tool is beginning to integrate machine learning, which allows searches with greater precision, reducing false positives and misses resulting from simple keyword searches. Spot trends over the past decade, and be notified when bills on your topic of interest are proposed. Come to this session to learn how to use it, hands-on. Also, get a sneak peek at a \u201cSecrecy Tracker\u201d that will provide research and analysis of national trends in legislation that infringes on public record and open meeting laws, through the University of Florida Brechner Freedom of Information Project.",

In 2021, Sof\u00eda Mej\u00edas Pascoe at the Voice of San Diego published a similar investigation of police contracts with private PR and crisis response firms. Does the public know their money is being used to spin information about police conduct back to them?

By requiring police in every department across the state to record data about every traffic stop \u2013 including the race of the driver, the reason for the stop, the outcome and dozens of other data points \u2013 the hope was to better understand and address racial profiling.\n\nOn the 20th anniversary, WBEZ Chicago and the Investigative Project on Race and Equity obtained and analyzed  42.5 million records from more than 1,000 police jurisdictions across Illinois collected under the law. This first-of-its-kind analysis showed the problem has only gotten worse: the share of traffic stops involving Black drivers has risen over time, reaching all-time high levels in recent years.",

Join the lead journalists on \u201cSecret Canada,\u201d an 18-month effort at a national Canadian newspaper that tackled a seemingly dry policy issue and turned it into a solutions-oriented, award-winning project that has served as a resource for the entire country. For the investigation, a team collected information on hundreds of thousands of completed FOIs and made them available to the public, wrote extensive guides on how to file requests and built FOI letter generators which readers have used 20,000 times.\n\nThis session will explore how the reporters tackled an ambitious (but achievable!) examination of Canada\u2019s broken access system, including how they designed a methodology for a national-scale investigation, time and file management, source development and story planning. Speakers will also talk about how the \u201cSecret Canada\u201d model can be imported to local and regional newsrooms.",

RNA members, a 75-year-old association for reporters who cover religion in the news media, have been voting on the annual story poll for decades and offer a deep well of insight on how to adapt these stories for your audiences. Come learn who the newsmakers you should be covering are, and the topics engaging audiences domestically and globally. From ongoing legislative and legal battles following the U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, to the exodus of thousands of congregations from the United Methodist Church and the global political debates over sexuality and transgender rights, the top 10 will show you how diverse and wide-ranging the stories are on the beat and touch all of our communities.
